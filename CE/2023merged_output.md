Dear Scott,

It was great to meet you too - please do come back to me if it would be useful to have further details of the project that Selim is undertaking with me. Selim and I are currently drafting an article, possibly for the International Journal of Social Research Methodologies and we could perhaps send you a draft version of our paper  - which we hope to submit this Autumn  - perhaps, if both you and Selim are happy with this, with a view to co-authorship?
Best wishes

Dear all,

 

Thank you *so much* for attending the RL meeting today!  I know people’s time is valuable and I really appreciate and got a lot out of all the brainpower of the attendees!  Thank you!

 

Please do send along any papers/ notes/ comments/ suggestions.  Please also keep me in mind for the future.  Obviously this project is in its infancy, but if there is any interest in being involved/ contributing I would of course be more than happy.  Personally, I think collaboration is key.  At least, I usually get a lot out of working and learning from colleagues.

 

Honestly, my head is spinning from all the excellent comments and suggestions.  Thank you again!

 

Best,

Scott

## 20230721_Re- G-NSUM and Modern Slavery in the UK[6]_text.txt
Date: 20230721
Subject: Re: G-NSUM and Modern Slavery in the UK

Dear Professor Moser,

I must apologise for the delay in responding to your email, which arrived at a busy time. to address the questions that you posed:

Selim and I are in the process of analysing the survey responses that we received. We hope to be in a position to use GNSUM techniques on our data and to estimate a figure for the extent of labour exploitation across the domestic worker population in the UK. This is ambitious, we know, and this is very much an exploratory undertaking to see if it can be done with the type of primary data we have collected and the available secondary data related to the wider DW population. 

The point of contact for our survey has been primarily national DW NGOs. Specifically, we have dealt with the voice of domestic workers, and two community-based NGOs supporting respectively Filipina and Latin American workers. These tend to be based in London and so we anticipate a London bias to our sample. As Domestic workers are employed by and as individuals, in private households we have chosen to focus our initial analysis upon their employment status rather than geography.

I would be very interested in keeping in touch with you as the 'comparative measurement project' develops - so do please keep in touch. Selim and I will be drafting our report over the next couple of weeks, with a view to developing a methodological paper in the Autumn. I hope that we may also keep you uptodate with our progress as these develop.

Best wishes

Caroline

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Sorry for the multiple emails, but in addition to my July 5th email (below), I would be very interested to know which NGOs you are working with.  Selim mentioned the necessity of partnering so as to have access to the ‘seeds’ in an RDS design.  Just curious. 

 

Many thanks and hope you are enjoying the summer!

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Thank you again for your input an participation in the workshop Zoe kindly organized for my (nascent) 'Comparative Measurements' project idea.  I am writing to ask a few things.  First, how is your G-NSUM research project going?  I am very interested in your work, and how you are finding the research + surveys + sampling from the 'hidden population.'   i don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I'd love to both know more about this project, and also pick your brains.  Where -- as in which location -- are you sampling from (and why)?  Which NGOs are you working with?   Do you have any suggestions regarding the 'right' geographic 'level' to use (e.g. council, county/borough, region)?

Next, would you be interested in being involved with the 'Comparative Measurements' project?  I recognize I am still in the early stages, and that I need to flesh things out considerably.  But it would seem to me to be an ideal 'fit' for you both to be involved.  But no presure 🙂

 

In any event, I hope you and yours are doing well and enjoying your summer!

 

Best,

scott

Subject: Re: G-NSUM and Modern Slavery in the UK

Dear Scott,

Thank you for your reply and for your evident enthusiasm for this project. I have made a start with a more detailed reading of the GNSUM literature and I have sketched out a protocol based upon Freehan and Salganik's (2014) paper of GNSUM procedures.  I am, however, not a highly trained statistician and your opinion would be of great value to us as we undertake an exploratory analysis, the protocol for which I attach here. I do hope that it may be possible for us to collaborate on this project - as you can probably now see clearly, your guidance and expertise would be invaluable to us. If you think there is value in an approach of these type, I wonder whether you might be free to meet  - either virtually or in person - with Selim and myself some time in mid- to late August after Selim returns from his holiday in China on the 18th? 

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline (if I may),

Thank you very much for your email.  I am very sorry for the inconvenience. and especially to bother you at busy times (I totally understand!)

I find your project very interesting and exciting!  I am vicariously happy for you all as you engage in the analysis!

You raise a very interesting and important issue RE: London.  Yes, I see your point.  London is SO BIG!  So if one is looking for members of any​ sub-population (doctors, domestic workers, etc. etc.) I would guess there would be more in a more highly populated area.  Then again, this is just a conjecture and could be empirically evaluated.  Just thinking aloud: for sure there are heterogeneous 'clustering' of some demographic groups by geography (above and beyond base-rates, e.g. Leicher has approximately the same percentage of non-UK born residents as London ); but I wonder if the same is true of domestic workers, victims of modern slavery, or other 'hidden groups.'  Hmm.  Possibly an interesting research project (?)  Then again, these demographic patterns almost surely match immigration patterns, I guess. 

Thank you again for your kind reply.  And yes!  I would love to (1) stay in touch (and hopefully convince you to collaborate! ) and (2) read your draft and learn more about the results of your study.  Really interesting!

I hope you and yours are enjoying the summer!

scott

Hi Scott and Selim,

I am free to meet on Monday 21st  before 1.30 or after 4pm . Scott, would you like to suggest a convenient time and whether you would prefer to meet in person or remotely that day?

As I understand it, the probe alters are the total of other DWs known to the sample respondents (i.e. in our survey, the number of DW contacts on their mobile phones). Thank you for these additional literature suggestions, Scott. I shall aim to have a look at these before we meet. Selim, could you please take a look at these too?

Dear Scott,

 

Thank you for your reply and for your evident enthusiasm for this project. I have made a start with a more detailed reading of the GNSUM literature and I have sketched out a protocol based upon Freehan and Salganik's (2014) paper of GNSUM procedures.  I am, however, not a highly trained statistician and your opinion would be of great value to us as we undertake an exploratory analysis, the protocol for which I attach here. I do hope that it may be possible for us to collaborate on this project - as you can probably now see clearly, your guidance and expertise would be invaluable to us. If you think there is value in an approach of these type, I wonder whether you might be free to meet  - either virtually or in person - with Selim and myself some time in mid- to late August after Selim returns from his holiday in China on the 18th?

Thank you very much for your email.  I am very sorry for the inconvenience. and especially to bother you at busy times (I totally understand!)

 

I find your project very interesting and exciting!  I am vicariously happy for you all as you engage in the analysis!

 

You raise a very interesting and important issue RE: London.  Yes, I see your point.  London is SO BIG!  So if one is looking for members of any​ sub-population (doctors, domestic workers, etc. etc.) I would guess there would be more in a more highly populated area.  Then again, this is just a conjecture and could be empirically evaluated.  Just thinking aloud: for sure there are heterogeneous 'clustering' of some demographic groups by geography (above and beyond base-rates, e.g. Leicher has approximately the same percentage of non-UK born residents as London ); but I wonder if the same is true of domestic workers, victims of modern slavery, or other 'hidden groups.'  Hmm.  Possibly an interesting research project (?)  Then again, these demographic patterns almost surely match immigration patterns, I guess. 

 

Thank you again for your kind reply.  And yes!  I would love to (1) stay in touch (and hopefully convince you to collaborate! ) and (2) read your draft and learn more about the results of your study.  Really interesting!

Selim and I are in the process of analysing the survey responses that we received. We hope to be in a position to use GNSUM techniques on our data and to estimate a figure for the extent of labour exploitation across the domestic worker population in the UK.

The point of contact for our survey has been primarily national DW NGOs. Specifically, we have dealt with the voice of domestic workers, and two community-based NGOs supporting respectively Filipina and Latin American workers. These tend to be based in London and so we anticipate a London bias to our sample. As Domestic workers are employed by and as individuals, in private households we have chosen to focus our initial analysis upon their employment status rather than geography.

Selim and I will be drafting our report over the next couple of weeks, with a view to developing a methodological paper in the Autumn.

## 20230808_Re- G-NSUM and Modern Slavery in the UK[2]_text.txt
Date: 20230808
Subject: Re: G-NSUM and Modern Slavery in the UK

Hi Scott,

I have been re-reading Feehan and Salagnik (2014, 2016a) and some of the literature that they cite (e.g. McCormick et al., 2012) in the light of your queries. And this is my reading of the content in relation to the helpful points that you raise:

The sample frame, F, is the set of those working in DW in the UK



F refers to the frame population from which the sample is taken,  (see Feehan and Salagnik 2014 p.4; F&S 2016a) for us this could be the total number of domestic workers in the UK with access to mobile phones. 


The way I read Figure 1, it is U that refers to the set of the total number of people in domestic work within the UK. [I have suggested that we estimate this for scale-up purposes by taking the official statistics related to the issue of ODW visas in a single year divided by two (each visa lasts for 6 months). This is likely to be an underestimation of the population size, given that there are also likely to be some British nationals in domestic work and also a grey market of indeterminate size, but it does provide us with a starting point.]


The hidden population, H, is the set of those working in DW being exploited (experiencing MS).

Yes, that is how I read it too.



But what are the probe alters? 

I have discussed this with my son  (a Natural Science graduate) and he interprets probe alters as the number of individuals identified in the networks of the domestic workers sampled- i.e. the alter sample goes beyond the respondents to consider the networks of those to whom they are linked.



Is there a separate sample from H (e.g. using RDS/ Snowball sampling)? 

If I am interpreting your question correctly, we have not yet asked the members of the Hidden population sample how many of their contacts know that they were exploited [although conceivable we could seek to extend data collection in a second phase to collect this data subject to ethical approval] For this reason, I have proposed that we carry out the basic NSUM calculation with the 2 adjustments proposed in F&S (2014) section 3 equ 24 that does not require us to have this collected this data. 



Do you have _enriched_ aggregate relational data (see pg. 161 of F&S2016)?  

No - not at present (see above)



I don’t see how one could calculate e.g. $\hat{\bar{v_{H,F}$ (eqn 7 in F&S).  What am I missing?



I don't think that we can- or that we need to -  calculate GNSUM this way  -rather we can calculate NSUM and then make the adjustments indicated in Eqn 24 ( using eqn 18, eqn 19). Do you think this would work?



I have omitted the calculation of the Frame ratio (eqn 17) from the protocol I attached earlier - and F&S do not include it in Eqn 24. At the moment, I can't see how we could calculate the denominator - (average number of connections from a member of U to F  ) unless we make a series of assumptions as some form of sensitivity analysis. The way I read it, F&S omit it from eqn 24 for this reason



That is, I see how one could calculate eqn. 23, but I do not see how the ‘improved version’ in eqn. 24 could be calculated.



I have tried to suggest in the protocol attached earlier how I see the proposed basic scale up measure, degree ratio and true positive rate may be calculated - and would value you opinion on whether the assumptions that I'm suggesting look reasonable.

 

A few thoughts:

F&S2016 relate G-NSUM to NSUM via three adjustment factors (eqn 15) and who how to calculate each of the adjustment factors (see also Yang and Yang  2017), and suggest these quantities themselves are of interest (and I agree).  It would be need to include these in the bootstrap to get a more ‘rounded’ (or complete) picture of what is going on in this hidden population.  Also, doing so might help with the sensitivity analysis.



I think that it is possible to calculate two of these factors (degree ratio and true positive ratio) from our data - and then to use these along with the F&S 2014 proposed basic scale up calculation to estimate the number in the hidden population (as shown in eqn 24). As mentioned above, I don't know how we could estimate the frame ratio - as by definition I don't believe we can collect any data on U - but maybe I am missing something.

 



I find that  without referring back to the source literature this is all quite complicated stuff to retain. I will read and take further notes of the literature that you have indicated and wonder whether we could each sense-check the proposed protocol in the light of this further reading and come ready to discuss any amendments (or show-stoppers) that arise as a result - even if this is simply a list of questions that still need to be answered?



Your email was very helpful in sense-checking my understanding - I think this may well be an iterative process. I understand that you will have less thinking time when teaching starts again in the Autumn, but perhaps Selim and I can start to draft out a possible paper for your review and comments? Perhaps we could discuss whether this approach - or some other way forward -  might work for us when we meet?



Thanks for the all the work that you have done on this so far.



Best wishes

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I’ve started to take a look at this and think I am starting to understand, but am also sure I am missing some (several) thinks.  Just so I understand:

The sample frame, F, is the set of those working in DW in the UK

The hidden population, H, is the set of those working in DW being exploited (experiencing MS).

But what are the probe alters?  Is there a separate sample from H (e.g. using RDS/ Snowball sampling)?  

Do you have _enriched_ aggregate relational data (see pg. 161 of F&S2016)?  I don’t see how one could calculate e.g. $\hat{\bar{v_{H,F}$ (eqn 7 in F&S).  What am I missing?

It would be need to include these in the bootstrap to get a more ‘rounded’ (or complete) picture of what is going on in this hidden population.  Also, doing so might help with the sensitivity analysis.

 

I found these papers helpful (and the Supplemental Appendix of F&S 2016 very dense, but very helpful as well).

Hi Scott,

I have been re-reading Feehan and Salagnik (2014, 2016a) and some of the literature that they cite (e.g. McCormick et al., 2012) in the light of your queries. And this is my reading of the content in relation to the helpful points that you raise:

The sample frame, F, is the set of those working in DW in the UK



F refers to the frame population from which the sample is taken,  (see Feehan and Salagnik 2014 p.4; F&S 2016a) for us this could be the total number of domestic workers in the UK with access to mobile phones. 


The way I read Figure 1, it is U that refers to the set of the total number of people in domestic work within the UK. [I have suggested that we estimate this for scale-up purposes by taking the official statistics related to the issue of ODW visas in a single year divided by two (each visa lasts for 6 months). This is likely to be an underestimation of the population size, given that there are also likely to be some British nationals in domestic work and also a grey market of indeterminate size, but it does provide us with a starting point.]


The hidden population, H, is the set of those working in DW being exploited (experiencing MS).

Yes, that is how I read it too.



But what are the probe alters? 

I have discussed this with my son  (a Natural Science graduate) and he interprets probe alters as the number of individuals identified in the networks of the domestic workers sampled- i.e. the alter sample goes beyond the respondents to consider the networks of those to whom they are linked.



Is there a separate sample from H (e.g. using RDS/ Snowball sampling)? 

If I am interpreting your question correctly, we have not yet asked the members of the Hidden population sample how many of their contacts know that they were exploited [although conceivable we could seek to extend data collection in a second phase to collect this data subject to ethical approval] For this reason, I have proposed that we carry out the basic NSUM calculation with the 2 adjustments proposed in F&S (2014) section 3 equ 24 that does not require us to have this collected this data. 



Do you have _enriched_ aggregate relational data (see pg. 161 of F&S2016)?  

No - not at present (see above)



I don’t see how one could calculate e.g. $\hat{\bar{v_{H,F}$ (eqn 7 in F&S).  What am I missing?



I don't think that we can- or that we need to -  calculate GNSUM this way  -rather we can calculate NSUM and then make the adjustments indicated in Eqn 24 ( using eqn 18, eqn 19). Do you think this would work?



I have omitted the calculation of the Frame ratio (eqn 17) from the protocol I attached earlier - and F&S do not include it in Eqn 24. At the moment, I can't see how we could calculate the denominator - (average number of connections from a member of U to F  ) unless we make a series of assumptions as some form of sensitivity analysis. The way I read it, F&S omit it from eqn 24 for this reason



That is, I see how one could calculate eqn. 23, but I do not see how the ‘improved version’ in eqn. 24 could be calculated.



I have tried to suggest in the protocol attached earlier how I see the proposed basic scale up measure, degree ratio and true positive rate may be calculated - and would value you opinion on whether the assumptions that I'm suggesting look reasonable.

 

A few thoughts:

F&S2016 relate G-NSUM to NSUM via three adjustment factors (eqn 15) and who how to calculate each of the adjustment factors (see also Yang and Yang  2017), and suggest these quantities themselves are of interest (and I agree).  It would be need to include these in the bootstrap to get a more ‘rounded’ (or complete) picture of what is going on in this hidden population.  Also, doing so might help with the sensitivity analysis.



I think that it is possible to calculate two of these factors (degree ratio and true positive ratio) from our data - and then to use these along with the F&S 2014 proposed basic scale up calculation to estimate the number in the hidden population (as shown in eqn 24). As mentioned above, I don't know how we could estimate the frame ratio - as by definition I don't believe we can collect any data on U - but maybe I am missing something.

 



I find that  without referring back to the source literature this is all quite complicated stuff to retain. I will read and take further notes of the literature that you have indicated and wonder whether we could each sense-check the proposed protocol in the light of this further reading and come ready to discuss any amendments (or show-stoppers) that arise as a result - even if this is simply a list of questions that still need to be answered?



Your email was very helpful in sense-checking my understanding - I think this may well be an iterative process. I understand that you will have less thinking time when teaching starts again in the Autumn, but perhaps Selim and I can start to draft out a possible paper for your review and comments? Perhaps we could discuss whether this approach - or some other way forward -  might work for us when we meet?



Thanks for the all the work that you have done on this so far.



Best wishes

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I’ve started to take a look at this and think I am starting to understand, but am also sure I am missing some (several) thinks.  Just so I understand:

The sample frame, F, is the set of those working in DW in the UK

The hidden population, H, is the set of those working in DW being exploited (experiencing MS).

But what are the probe alters?  Is there a separate sample from H (e.g. using RDS/ Snowball sampling)?  

Do you have _enriched_ aggregate relational data (see pg. 161 of F&S2016)?  I don’t see how one could calculate e.g. $\hat{\bar{v_{H,F}$ (eqn 7 in F&S).  What am I missing?

It would be need to include these in the bootstrap to get a more ‘rounded’ (or complete) picture of what is going on in this hidden population.  Also, doing so might help with the sensitivity analysis.

 

I found these papers helpful (and the Supplemental Appendix of F&S 2016 very dense, but very helpful as well).

Dear Scott,

 

Thank you for your reply and for your evident enthusiasm for this project. I have made a start with a more detailed reading of the GNSUM literature and I have sketched out a protocol based upon Freehan and Salganik's (2014) paper of GNSUM procedures.  I am, however, not a highly trained statistician and your opinion would be of great value to us as we undertake an exploratory analysis, the protocol for which I attach here. I do hope that it may be possible for us to collaborate on this project - as you can probably now see clearly, your guidance and expertise would be invaluable to us. If you think there is value in an approach of these type, I wonder whether you might be free to meet  - either virtually or in person - with Selim and myself some time in mid- to late August after Selim returns from his holiday in China on the 18th? 

 

Best wishes

Dear Caroline (if I may),

 

Thank you very much for your email.  I am very sorry for the inconvenience. and especially to bother you at busy times (I totally understand!)

 

I find your project very interesting and exciting!  I am vicariously happy for you all as you engage in the analysis!

 

You raise a very interesting and important issue RE: London.  Yes, I see your point.  London is SO BIG!  So if one is looking for members of any​ sub-population (doctors, domestic workers, etc. etc.) I would guess there would be more in a more highly populated area.  Then again, this is just a conjecture and could be empirically evaluated.  Just thinking aloud: for sure there are heterogeneous 'clustering' of some demographic groups by geography (above and beyond base-rates, e.g. Leicher has approximately the same percentage of non-UK born residents as London ); but I wonder if the same is true of domestic workers, victims of modern slavery, or other 'hidden groups.'  Hmm.  Possibly an interesting research project (?)  Then again, these demographic patterns almost surely match immigration patterns, I guess. 

 

Thank you again for your kind reply.  And yes!  I would love to (1) stay in touch (and hopefully convince you to collaborate! ) and (2) read your draft and learn more about the results of your study.  Really interesting!

 

I hope you and yours are enjoying the summer!

Best,

scott

Dear Professor Moser,

 

I must apologise for the delay in responding to your email, which arrived at a busy time. to address the questions that you posed:

 

Selim and I are in the process of analysing the survey responses that we received. We hope to be in a position to use GNSUM techniques on our data and to estimate a figure for the extent of labour exploitation across the domestic worker population in the UK. This is ambitious, we know, and this is very much an exploratory undertaking to see if it can be done with the type of primary data we have collected and the available secondary data related to the wider DW population. 

 

The point of contact for our survey has been primarily national DW NGOs. Specifically, we have dealt with the voice of domestic workers, and two community-based NGOs supporting respectively Filipina and Latin American workers. These tend to be based in London and so we anticipate a London bias to our sample. As Domestic workers are employed by and as individuals, in private households we have chosen to focus our initial analysis upon their employment status rather than geography.

 

I would be very interested in keeping in touch with you as the 'comparative measurement project' develops - so do please keep in touch. Selim and I will be drafting our report over the next couple of weeks, with a view to developing a methodological paper in the Autumn. I hope that we may also keep you uptodate with our progress as these develop.

 

Best wishes

 

Caroline

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Thank you again for your input an participation in the workshop Zoe kindly organized for my (nascent) 'Comparative Measurements' project idea.  I am writing to ask a few things.  First, how is your G-NSUM research project going?  I am very interested in your work, and how you are finding the research + surveys + sampling from the 'hidden population.'   i don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I'd love to both know more about this project, and also pick your brains.  Where -- as in which location -- are you sampling from (and why)?  Which NGOs are you working with?   Do you have any suggestions regarding the 'right' geographic 'level' to use (e.g. council, county/borough, region)?

Next, would you be interested in being involved with the 'Comparative Measurements' project?  I recognize I am still in the early stages, and that I need to flesh things out considerably.  But it would seem to me to be an ideal 'fit' for you both to be involved.  But no presure 🙂

 

In any event, I hope you and yours are doing well and enjoying your summer!

 

Best,

scott

Dear Scott,

This is all very good news I think. I can confirm that we have respondents' data related to the 'how many' questions that you pose below.

My earlier suggestion was to for us all to test the protocol I suggested earlier against the F&S 2016 paper procedures (and the wider reading that you have indicated Scott). Very happy that you feel able to provide the 2 (?) adjustment factors and the robustness/ sensitivity analysis that F&S suggest are needed this would be fantastic. If when you meet you could explain to us the form of the data that we need to share with you, to complete these calculations, we can ensure that what we provide you with can be used.

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear All,

 

Thanks for this, Caroline.  I’m free before 4pm, just as you.  Late AM or early PM would be ideal for me, but I’m very flexible.  Ideally we would meet in person, but I’m in the middle of house buying and I’ve been working from home mainly these days.  Is a teams meet OK?

 

I have replication materials from the Yang and Yang paper (well, sort of.  The actual ARD data isn’t public, but he provided the R: code as a skeleton.  I think we should be able to figure out what they did.)

 

What can/ should I do to prepare?  I can try to dive into the supplemental information of the F&S 2016 paper.  As I mentioned, it is comprehensive, but really dense.  On my end, I think what I can ‘bring to the table’ is estimation of the three adjustments (subject to my last email), and robustness/ sensitivity to the assumptions (probe alter condition, aggregate ard, etc. etc.)

Also on my end: I confess I don’t know where their \pi_i (the probability of being included in sample and $c$ -- the ‘relative probability sample’) come from/ are doing.  Perhaps the Yang and Yang replication data can shed a light on this?

 

As for probe alters (Pas), Caroline: are you saying you have info on a question such as “how many DW do you know?”  “Of those, how many know you are being exploited/ experiencing MS?”  If so, then yes in principle we are in business.  Usually there are between 5-20 groups of known size, but your technically correct that one could perform the estimation with only one PA group, provided the size of the PA group is known (though, I suppose one could use the estimation technique in Feehan et a. 2022 to estimate the size of this group.  I haven’t seen this done, and I’d guess that the uncertainty would get very very large.  I’ve played with this estimation of group-sizes from survey data and was very very surprised to see the uncertainty in Feehand et al. 2022 does _not_ blow up, at least not in their example.)

 

And yes, the probe alters are limited to the Frame (pg. 161).  So that is good news for you all, I think.

 

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott and Selim,

 

I am free to meet on Monday 21st  before 1.30 or after 4pm . Scott, would you like to suggest a convenient time and whether you would prefer to meet in person or remotely that day?

 

As I understand it, the probe alters are the total of other DWs known to the sample respondents (i.e. in our survey, the number of DW contacts on their mobile phones). Thank you for these additional literature suggestions, Scott. I shall aim to have a look at these before we meet. Selim, could you please take a look at these too?

You raise a very interesting and important issue RE: London.  Yes, I see your point.  London is SO BIG!  So if one is looking for members of any​ sub-population (doctors, domestic workers, etc. etc.) I would guess there would be more in a more highly populated area.  Then again, this is just a conjecture and could be empirically evaluated.  Just thinking aloud: for sure there are heterogeneous 'clustering' of some demographic groups by geography (above and beyond base-rates, e.g. Leicher has approximately the same percentage of non-UK born residents as London ); but I wonder if the same is true of domestic workers, victims of modern slavery, or other 'hidden groups.'  Hmm.  Possibly an interesting research project (?)  Then again, these demographic patterns almost surely match immigration patterns, I guess. 

 

Thank you again for your kind reply.  And yes!  I would love to (1) stay in touch (and hopefully convince you to collaborate! ) and (2) read your draft and learn more about the results of your study.  Really interesting!

 

I hope you and yours are enjoying the summer!

Best,

scott

Dear Professor Moser,

 

I must apologise for the delay in responding to your email, which arrived at a busy time. to address the questions that you posed:

 

Selim and I are in the process of analysing the survey responses that we received. We hope to be in a position to use GNSUM techniques on our data and to estimate a figure for the extent of labour exploitation across the domestic worker population in the UK. This is ambitious, we know, and this is very much an exploratory undertaking to see if it can be done with the type of primary data we have collected and the available secondary data related to the wider DW population. 

 

The point of contact for our survey has been primarily national DW NGOs. Specifically, we have dealt with the voice of domestic workers, and two community-based NGOs supporting respectively Filipina and Latin American workers. These tend to be based in London and so we anticipate a London bias to our sample. As Domestic workers are employed by and as individuals, in private households we have chosen to focus our initial analysis upon their employment status rather than geography.

 

I would be very interested in keeping in touch with you as the 'comparative measurement project' develops - so do please keep in touch. Selim and I will be drafting our report over the next couple of weeks, with a view to developing a methodological paper in the Autumn. I hope that we may also keep you uptodate with our progress as these develop.

 

Best wishes

 

Caroline

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Sorry for the multiple emails, but in addition to my July 5th email (below), I would be very interested to know which NGOs you are working with.  Selim mentioned the necessity of partnering so as to have access to the ‘seeds’ in an RDS design.  Just curious. 

 

Many thanks and hope you are enjoying the summer!

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Thank you again for your input an participation in the workshop Zoe kindly organized for my (nascent) 'Comparative Measurements' project idea.  I am writing to ask a few things.  First, how is your G-NSUM research project going?  I am very interested in your work, and how you are finding the research + surveys + sampling from the 'hidden population.'   i don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I'd love to both know more about this project, and also pick your brains.  Where -- as in which location -- are you sampling from (and why)?  Which NGOs are you working with?   Do you have any suggestions regarding the 'right' geographic 'level' to use (e.g. council, county/borough, region)?

Next, would you be interested in being involved with the 'Comparative Measurements' project?  I recognize I am still in the early stages, and that I need to flesh things out considerably.  But it would seem to me to be an ideal 'fit' for you both to be involved.  But no presure 🙂

 

In any event, I hope you and yours are doing well and enjoying your summer!

 

Best,

scott

Hi Scott,

My apologies for the delay in sending through a definitive time for this meeting. I hope that 11-12 am may still be convenient for you, but if not do please suggest an earlier time in the morning. I have suggested that we go for a remote meeting this time.

If you could come prepared with any queries related to the protocol that have arisen from your reading of the literature that would be superb.

Have a great weekend - and I look forward to catching up with you on Monday.

Date: 20230822
Subject: Re: Scott Moser (staff) shared the folder "GNSUM-CEandSY" with you

Hi Scott,

I've taken a brief look at the definitions of sampling weights and primary sample units. 

My initial thoughts are that, should we need to, we can estimate a sampling weight (as the number of individuals in the population each respondent in the sample is representing) based upon either a breakdown of the number of ODWs from each migrant community granted a visa compared with the number of respondents from that community in our sample. This would be likely to result in some residual respondents from communities that may not be represented in official statistics. Or we could take a more holistic view and describe the sampling weight of the total respondent set (90+ responses) across the ODW population as a whole 18,000+ 

In terms of primary sampling units - we asked NGO partners from organisations that represented either domestic workers in the UK or specialist community groups (Latin American Women and the Filipino community) to identify domestic worker seeds for us. So perhaps our primary sampling unit (the sampling unit chosen in the first stage of selection) is the domestic worker?

Look forward to discussing this with you further
Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Scott,

Thanks for sparing us your valuable time this morning. I have made some notes and pointers based on our discussion. Selim and I will commence with the data cleaning and a suggested operationalisation of the 'how many do I know in Hn' questions and hope to come back to you presently.


I note from your comments that,
Equation 23 v equation 24 of F&S 2016 are primarily of interest to us
in essence, what we have is best presented as a convenience sample of people from the UK who have been employed as a domestic worker who have a cell phone number and have been employed in domestic work in the past 12 months
There may be some data problems in the way that that questions that have the potential to skew the data e.g.'How many x do you know' has been specified to refer only to those with cell phones (this was done to reduce the risk of recall error)
There may be some definitional issues - related to the multiple ways in which labour exploitation has been operationalised (it may be possible to group these questions to provide different lens e.g.  forced labour v less severe forms of labour abuse which could be interesting, with different robustness levels)
More substantive issues may exist in relation to the size of the social network
Given the data, it is not possible to calculate a frame ratio (although one approach suggested by F&S would suggest that this is not needed) or, due to the lack of enriched aggregated data, the true positive rate (although I must admit that I still need to look at this again to understand this problem) 
There is only one probe alter for domestic workers- 5-20 are more common
Positively
Bootstrapping is the way to go - which you can help us with 
We have the average degree from the hidden group to the frame so the data exists to calculate the degree ratio - to 95 CI  - can cite those who say this is of interest  - what is needed now is a justification for the practical usefulness of this adjustment factor
The data is richer than is common for SU studies, with the option to explore multiple forms of H
These can be run through with robust sensitivity checks - which you can help us with too
F&S 2016 identify 5 different GNSUM estimates - which one to choose is an interesting question
Micro household sampling is nice
F and U and clear and coherent
Data cleaning
Separation of text and numbers e.g. Q1 of 2 seems to have both
Logical inconsistencies e.g. Q85 and Q86 - Q86 must be no larger than Q85 (follow logic to maximise data)
Phone numbers entered where count expected (need to be converted
Remove or explain apparent repetition e.g. Q83 and Q88
I hope that I have covered all the substantive issues that we covered. Enjoy your holiday

Best wishes
Caroline

## 20230829_Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers- Indicators of forced labour_text.txt
Date: 20230829
Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour

Hi Scott,

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 



I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 



Best wishes

Caroline

## 20230905_Re- Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers- Indicators of forced labour[5]_text.txt
Date: 20230905
Subject: Re: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour

I've planned in some time on Thursday morning to read the papers that you sent through. Happy to meet with you when convenient on the 14th - just let us know.

(It said 'numerical in the attachment before - I added the 'count' for clarity in response to your message !)

Best wishes
Caroline

Doh!  So sorry – yes of course, it even says ‘Numerical – count.’  So sorry!  So, yes, in principle.  But you need to know the ‘true size’ of these groups.  So 83 5f15 looks quite promising, b/c we know the number of people gone though NRM.  The others I’m not sure of.  But you both might know of data-sources that would provide ‘known sizes.’

 

Earlier is better, but I have a deadline on the 11th that I know I’m going to miss (and am aiming for the 12th).  So, the 14th AM is likely the most feasible.  But as I said, time is of the essence, for me at least.

 

In terms of boot-strapping.  Yea, the neighboorhood bootstrat is shockingly simple, and gives great results, and is already implemented in R:.  The issue is that Selim will have to make a copy of the data and get it into the format that the ‘neighborboot’ package ‘wants’ (check out the link I sent last email).

 

Yes, also, sorry for my scattered replies.  Please do reply as you see fit.

 

Best, 

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I'm responding to this and your other email in one thread. Thanks for the bootstrapping literature - I shall read this in more detail but the headline news is that I do think we have this data and Selim is happy to carry out the further data cleansing you suggest.

 

BTW, on the probe alters point below - they may still not be suitable probe alters, but the data are all numerical counts.

 

Very interested in the possibilities for constructing an index. Do you have a slot next week at one of the following times?

 

Tuesday 12th AM

Thursday 14th AM

Friday 15th anytime before 4pm

 

It would be great to move this forward with you  - thanks for agreeing to come on board. I understand the time constraints imposed by teaching, but hopefully we can find a way to work on this around our other commitments.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Scott,

 

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

 

[Scott Moser (staff)] Great!  And yes, Our ‘forced labor’ questions largely overlap.  I also had as possible indicators: Q36, Q21/25, Q35, Q83.  Just FYI.  But yes, we have multiple indicators.  We could either settle on one/ a few or build an index (see below).

 

 

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 

[Scott Moser (staff)] If I am understanding you, this is potentially a very cool idea.  I think you are suggesting constructing a new variable that indicates/captures the confidence we (as researchers) have that this particular person is in MS.  If so, this might connect to the ‘risk of MS’ literature, which seems to be a big policy focus.  And which is separate from the prevalence issue.  Are you thinking about something like a Likert scale?

 

I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 

[Scott Moser (staff)]Not to be negative, but I don’t think so.  Aren’t these questions 0/1 (as in ‘do you now someone’ yes/no?)  And for probe alters we need counts. 

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Subject: Re: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour

Hi Scott,
Forgive me, but I am not familiar with what some of the notation that you use refers to but, if I am understanding you correctly, and if there is a social link between the two, then I think your assumption is plausible.  I agree that we can test the respective assumptions and see what effect they have on subsequent models.

I have started some rough drafts of the literature related to the Feehan and Salganik paper and the bootstrapping papers to which you directed us. I don't seem to have the ability to upload these to the shared drive that you have set up, which is why I have included them here.
Feehan and Salganik.docxBootstrapping Methods.docx

Perhaps we can discuss and agree expectations related to what we need to do and who has the capacity and ability to do it?

Selim and I have also discussed keeping a record of our explorations to help us write up the methodology - perhaps we can agree the best way to do this when we meet on Thursday. What time works best for you?

Best wishes
Caroline

Sorry to be yet more scattered, but I had another idea, following on your NRM probe-alter idea.  Regarding visibility, if we are willing to make the herculean assumption that everyone a person $i \in H$ knows that have gone through the NRM, _also_ knows that $i$ is in H, then I think we are in business with the visibility quantity. This might (or might not) be a reasonable assumption:  An exploited worker who knows someone in NRM, likely has a reciprocal relationship (?) – the person in NRM likely knows the exploited worker is in H.  Maybe?  

 

At the end of the day, we will likely try out lots and lots of models with more or less dubious assumptions and report the interesting ones faithfully (as in, ‘to obtain visibility estimates we assume that blablabla.’  Or ‘we exclude such and such observations because blablabla’, etc.)

 

I’m generally a fan of ‘poking at’ the research question from many different angles (usually all quantitative, as is my nature 😊 )

 

Sorry for being so scattered and massive kudos to Caroline for taking on the challenge of making my scattered comments coherent (if they can be!)

 

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott

 

I've sent through a calendar link for the meeting suggesting a 10.30 start. I hope that that gives you enough time for the coffee hit.

 

I agree with your agenda. We have Selim currently full time until the end of this month, so if you are happy to direct him, this could give us a head start on the data cleaning. I am happy to discuss what else needs to be done and allocate tasks as best we can later this morning.

 

Looking forward to moving this forward with you

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi All,

 

Sorry for being odd and inconsistent in arranging a meeting.  I can meet via Teams at 10:30am or 11am tomorrow, Thursday (i just have to wake up in time to consume lots and lots of coffee!)  I will do my best to read the documents that Caroline provided (thanks!)

Ihave had a peek at the neighborhood bootstraping articles/ CRAN packages.  Selim: you are going to want to get very familiar with the Neighboot​package, specifically the 

to.rds {Neighboot}

 

function.

 

I don't have an agenda nor 'plan' for our meeting tomorrow -- I hope one of you (or both of you?) do.  To my mind, the biggest issues are:

1.What is next?  What is the objective and what is the division of labour?  (I think we have answers to this, but it would help me to flesh them out and be clear.)

2.What are the data-requirements?  That is, what reshaping/cleaning/ 'wrangling' need be done?

3.Analysis: what do we want to do?  I think Caroline's memos and input are very helpful here, but again it would help me to be crystal clear on what/ which analysis we want to perform/ report.   

 

Caroline: if you have managed to cobble together something coherent from my scattered emails/ replies to emails, you are a STAR! And I'd love to see / know what you are thinking, in terms of an agenda/ way forward.

 

Talk to you all soon!

Scott

Hi Scott,

Forgive me, but I am not familiar with what some of the notation that you use refers to but, if I am understanding you correctly, and if there is a social link between the two, then I think your assumption is plausible.  I agree that we can test the respective assumptions and see what effect they have on subsequent models.

 

I have started some rough drafts of the literature related to the Feehan and Salganik paper and the bootstrapping papers to which you directed us. I don't seem to have the ability to upload these to the shared drive that you have set up, which is why I have included them here.

Feehan and Salganik.docxBootstrapping Methods.docx

 

Perhaps we can discuss and agree expectations related to what we need to do and who has the capacity and ability to do it?

 

Selim and I have also discussed keeping a record of our explorations to help us write up the methodology - perhaps we can agree the best way to do this when we meet on Thursday. What time works best for you?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Sorry to be yet more scattered, but I had another idea, following on your NRM probe-alter idea.  Regarding visibility, if we are willing to make the herculean assumption that everyone a person $i \in H$ knows that have gone through the NRM, _also_ knows that $i$ is in H, then I think we are in business with the visibility quantity. This might (or might not) be a reasonable assumption:  An exploited worker who knows someone in NRM, likely has a reciprocal relationship (?) – the person in NRM likely knows the exploited worker is in H.  Maybe?  

 

At the end of the day, we will likely try out lots and lots of models with more or less dubious assumptions and report the interesting ones faithfully (as in, ‘to obtain visibility estimates we assume that blablabla.’  Or ‘we exclude such and such observations because blablabla’, etc.)

 

I’m generally a fan of ‘poking at’ the research question from many different angles (usually all quantitative, as is my nature 😊 )

 

Sorry for being so scattered and massive kudos to Caroline for taking on the challenge of making my scattered comments coherent (if they can be!)

 

Best,

Scott

Doh!  So sorry – yes of course, it even says ‘Numerical – count.’  So sorry!  So, yes, in principle.  But you need to know the ‘true size’ of these groups.  So 83 5f15 looks quite promising, b/c we know the number of people gone though NRM.  The others I’m not sure of.  But you both might know of data-sources that would provide ‘known sizes.’

 

Earlier is better, but I have a deadline on the 11th that I know I’m going to miss (and am aiming for the 12th).  So, the 14th AM is likely the most feasible.  But as I said, time is of the essence, for me at least.

 

In terms of boot-strapping.  Yea, the neighboorhood bootstrat is shockingly simple, and gives great results, and is already implemented in R:.  The issue is that Selim will have to make a copy of the data and get it into the format that the ‘neighborboot’ package ‘wants’ (check out the link I sent last email).

 

Yes, also, sorry for my scattered replies.  Please do reply as you see fit.

 

Best, 

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I'm responding to this and your other email in one thread. Thanks for the bootstrapping literature - I shall read this in more detail but the headline news is that I do think we have this data and Selim is happy to carry out the further data cleansing you suggest.

 

BTW, on the probe alters point below - they may still not be suitable probe alters, but the data are all numerical counts.

 

Very interested in the possibilities for constructing an index. Do you have a slot next week at one of the following times?

 

Tuesday 12th AM

Thursday 14th AM

Friday 15th anytime before 4pm

 

It would be great to move this forward with you  - thanks for agreeing to come on board. I understand the time constraints imposed by teaching, but hopefully we can find a way to work on this around our other commitments.

 

Best wishes

Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour 

 

Hi Scott,

 

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

 

[Scott Moser (staff)] Great!  And yes, Our ‘forced labor’ questions largely overlap.  I also had as possible indicators: Q36, Q21/25, Q35, Q83.  Just FYI.  But yes, we have multiple indicators.  We could either settle on one/ a few or build an index (see below).

 

 

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 

[Scott Moser (staff)] If I am understanding you, this is potentially a very cool idea.  I think you are suggesting constructing a new variable that indicates/captures the confidence we (as researchers) have that this particular person is in MS.  If so, this might connect to the ‘risk of MS’ literature, which seems to be a big policy focus.  And which is separate from the prevalence issue.  Are you thinking about something like a Likert scale?

 

I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 

[Scott Moser (staff)]Not to be negative, but I don’t think so.  Aren’t these questions 0/1 (as in ‘do you now someone’ yes/no?)  And for probe alters we need counts. 

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Scott

I've sent through a calendar link for the meeting suggesting a 10.30 start. I hope that that gives you enough time for the coffee hit.

I agree with your agenda. We have Selim currently full time until the end of this month, so if you are happy to direct him, this could give us a head start on the data cleaning. I am happy to discuss what else needs to be done and allocate tasks as best we can later this morning.

Looking forward to moving this forward with you

Subject: Re: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour


Thanks for this Scott. In answer to your question about which indicators could be combined to form an index, I believe that there are six.

I've now highlighted these in the linked GNSUM ILO indicators.docx document that I shared earlier.

On the census quality data - in terms of the DW population size the best that we can do for this is for a subset of our DW respondents - i.e. if we were only to estimate the hidden population among Filipino domestic workers (67 of our 97 respondents), then we can use the Government's Figure for the issues of  Overseas Domestic Workers' to Filipino workers, although this is still somewhat problemmatic as some of our respondents may have been granted leave to remain.

I'll look into the NRM figures - this may be a better bet.

Many thanks for this, Caroline.  I think this is basically right, but note we don't need an adacency matrix.  I think it will be easier if I just write some functions In R: to do the neighborhood bootstrapping.

Selim: do you know R:?  If not, it would behoove you to learn it -- not just for this project but for others.
After the data cleaning, and the choice of indicators for the hidden population, it could be great if Selim could write some small functions in R: that take as input (1) a data-set and(2) the variable(s) we want to use and (3) the 'known sub-population sizes and and calculates the quantities in Caroline's protocol.  Though, please see the attached in which I have some questions and comments.
Please note that it is critical that we have the known size of at least one probe alter group (PAG).  We discussed the number of people going through the NRM (presumably in some specified time-frame e.g. the last 12 months).  The other obvious PAG is the number of DW in the UK (technically that have a mobile, but we can probably ignore that part).  Caroline mentioned this is not easy/ perhaps not possible.  I'll leave it to you two get these number(s).  It is extremely important that we have census-quality data for the size of the PAG.

With these, I can do the bootstrap.

Exploratory protocol based upon Feehan and Salganik (2016)SJM.docx

Hi Scott

 

I've sent through a calendar link for the meeting suggesting a 10.30 start. I hope that that gives you enough time for the coffee hit.

 

I agree with your agenda. We have Selim currently full time until the end of this month, so if you are happy to direct him, this could give us a head start on the data cleaning. I am happy to discuss what else needs to be done and allocate tasks as best we can later this morning.

 

Looking forward to moving this forward with you

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi All,

 

Sorry for being odd and inconsistent in arranging a meeting.  I can meet via Teams at 10:30am or 11am tomorrow, Thursday (i just have to wake up in time to consume lots and lots of coffee!)  I will do my best to read the documents that Caroline provided (thanks!)

Ihave had a peek at the neighborhood bootstraping articles/ CRAN packages.  Selim: you are going to want to get very familiar with the Neighboot​package, specifically the 

to.rds {Neighboot}

 

function.

 

I don't have an agenda nor 'plan' for our meeting tomorrow -- I hope one of you (or both of you?) do.  To my mind, the biggest issues are:

1.What is next?  What is the objective and what is the division of labour?  (I think we have answers to this, but it would help me to flesh them out and be clear.)

2.What are the data-requirements?  That is, what reshaping/cleaning/ 'wrangling' need be done?

3.Analysis: what do we want to do?  I think Caroline's memos and input are very helpful here, but again it would help me to be crystal clear on what/ which analysis we want to perform/ report.   

 

Caroline: if you have managed to cobble together something coherent from my scattered emails/ replies to emails, you are a STAR! And I'd love to see / know what you are thinking, in terms of an agenda/ way forward.

 

Talk to you all soon!

Scott

Hi Scott,

Forgive me, but I am not familiar with what some of the notation that you use refers to but, if I am understanding you correctly, and if there is a social link between the two, then I think your assumption is plausible.  I agree that we can test the respective assumptions and see what effect they have on subsequent models.

 

I have started some rough drafts of the literature related to the Feehan and Salganik paper and the bootstrapping papers to which you directed us. I don't seem to have the ability to upload these to the shared drive that you have set up, which is why I have included them here.

Feehan and Salganik.docxBootstrapping Methods.docx

 

Perhaps we can discuss and agree expectations related to what we need to do and who has the capacity and ability to do it?

 

Selim and I have also discussed keeping a record of our explorations to help us write up the methodology - perhaps we can agree the best way to do this when we meet on Thursday. What time works best for you?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Sorry to be yet more scattered, but I had another idea, following on your NRM probe-alter idea.  Regarding visibility, if we are willing to make the herculean assumption that everyone a person $i \in H$ knows that have gone through the NRM, _also_ knows that $i$ is in H, then I think we are in business with the visibility quantity. This might (or might not) be a reasonable assumption:  An exploited worker who knows someone in NRM, likely has a reciprocal relationship (?) – the person in NRM likely knows the exploited worker is in H.  Maybe?  

 

At the end of the day, we will likely try out lots and lots of models with more or less dubious assumptions and report the interesting ones faithfully (as in, ‘to obtain visibility estimates we assume that blablabla.’  Or ‘we exclude such and such observations because blablabla’, etc.)

 

I’m generally a fan of ‘poking at’ the research question from many different angles (usually all quantitative, as is my nature 😊 )

 

Sorry for being so scattered and massive kudos to Caroline for taking on the challenge of making my scattered comments coherent (if they can be!)

 

Best,

Scott

Doh!  So sorry – yes of course, it even says ‘Numerical – count.’  So sorry!  So, yes, in principle.  But you need to know the ‘true size’ of these groups.  So 83 5f15 looks quite promising, b/c we know the number of people gone though NRM.  The others I’m not sure of.  But you both might know of data-sources that would provide ‘known sizes.’

 

Earlier is better, but I have a deadline on the 11th that I know I’m going to miss (and am aiming for the 12th).  So, the 14th AM is likely the most feasible.  But as I said, time is of the essence, for me at least.

 

In terms of boot-strapping.  Yea, the neighboorhood bootstrat is shockingly simple, and gives great results, and is already implemented in R:.  The issue is that Selim will have to make a copy of the data and get it into the format that the ‘neighborboot’ package ‘wants’ (check out the link I sent last email).

 

Yes, also, sorry for my scattered replies.  Please do reply as you see fit.

 

Best, 

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I'm responding to this and your other email in one thread. Thanks for the bootstrapping literature - I shall read this in more detail but the headline news is that I do think we have this data and Selim is happy to carry out the further data cleansing you suggest.

 

BTW, on the probe alters point below - they may still not be suitable probe alters, but the data are all numerical counts.

 

Very interested in the possibilities for constructing an index. Do you have a slot next week at one of the following times?

 

Tuesday 12th AM

Thursday 14th AM

Friday 15th anytime before 4pm

 

It would be great to move this forward with you  - thanks for agreeing to come on board. I understand the time constraints imposed by teaching, but hopefully we can find a way to work on this around our other commitments.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour 

 

Hi Scott,

 

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

 

[Scott Moser (staff)] Great!  And yes, Our ‘forced labor’ questions largely overlap.  I also had as possible indicators: Q36, Q21/25, Q35, Q83.  Just FYI.  But yes, we have multiple indicators.  We could either settle on one/ a few or build an index (see below).

 

 

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 

[Scott Moser (staff)] If I am understanding you, this is potentially a very cool idea.  I think you are suggesting constructing a new variable that indicates/captures the confidence we (as researchers) have that this particular person is in MS.  If so, this might connect to the ‘risk of MS’ literature, which seems to be a big policy focus.  And which is separate from the prevalence issue.  Are you thinking about something like a Likert scale?

 

I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 

[Scott Moser (staff)]Not to be negative, but I don’t think so.  Aren’t these questions 0/1 (as in ‘do you now someone’ yes/no?)  And for probe alters we need counts. 

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Thanks Caroline! 

### One: "Create a risk variable" 

Sorry if I'm being dense, but these questions are about _other people_, right?  I had thought -- and I might very well be wrong -- that we were going to use questions / indicators that could be used to identify persons experiencing MS. For example, and answer of (0) or (1) on 80. 5f12: Have you or someone you know personally been advised to enter the NRM? 
(0) I have been advised to enter the NRM and was referred
(1) I was advised, but decided not to enter the NRM
or 72. 5f4: Do you feel your working environment is safe and healthy?
70. 5f2: Has your employer, or their agent, withheld from you your travel and iden�ty documenta�on?
or 61. 5d8: Does your weekly rest last longer than 24 hours consecu�vely?
or an answer of 0-4 on 55. 5d4-b: Please mark, if you have NOT received any of the following (you can select more than one op�on)
or especially 50. 5d1 to 5d2-a (inclusive)
or espeically 45. 5c2, 46. 5c3, 47. 5c4, 42. 5b7: Has your pay ever been withheld by your employer?
32. 5a4: In your most recent job, have you ever felt that you could not leave your work premises?
30. 5a2: Do you have control over the �mes of the day that you work?
(espeically)  29. 5a1: Have you ever been forced to do any work by your employer or household against your will?

Maybe the following, but likely not.  Just some suggestions.
36. 5b1: How much are you paid an hour, before tax and other deduc�ons?
44. 5c1 -44.5c1-b
57. 5d4-c: Please mark if you have NOT received the following informa�on as part of your contract (you can select more than one op�on):
or 63. 5d10: Do you feel you suffer from a lack of privacy in your work? (maybe?)

Etc. These questions are about the self, not others.  The questions you highlighted are excellent potential indicators of the size of a personal network that includes members from the hidden population.  That is, these variables are great to us as different indicators for the size of H. 

But I see why you would send these -- I was speaking gibberish in our meeting regarding 'scaling up' when the DV isn't dichotomous.  I dont' think that is what we want to do.  Rather, I have/had it in my head that we would create a 'risk index' variable measuring an _individual's risk (propensity?) of experiencing MS_.  If so, then there is no 'scaling up.'  Rather, we would use the risk index variable as the DV in a regression model.  Sorry for talking nonsense in the meeting.[^  Though, intellectually i like the idea of thinking about what 'scaling up' even means when the variable in question isn't a count.  I can't say even know what that means, since 'scaling up' is explicitly about taking counts from individual social networks and using that information (along with other population-level information e.g. known group sizes) to estimate population-level counts (e.g. the size of H), but might be fun to think about.]

### Two

Once we have the 'know size(s)' we can crack on with the calculations.  I think your approach (eg. Philopeno visas) is a good idea.  At the end of the day, we can only work with the data we have.  

### Three

I think I have a pretty clear idea of what Selim and I need to do, coding-wise.   I hope he can automate the calculations, per your protocol (but did my comments/ questions make sense?  Or should I ignore them?).  And I can do the bootstrapping.  

I hope this makes sense (?)  Does it?


Thank you!

Scott

Thanks for this Scott. In answer to your question about which indicators could be combined to form an index, I believe that there are six.

I've now highlighted these in the linked GNSUM ILO indicators.docx document that I shared earlier.

On the census quality data - in terms of the DW population size the best that we can do for this is for a subset of our DW respondents - i.e. if we were only to estimate the hidden population among Filipino domestic workers (67 of our 97 respondents), then we can use the Government's Figure for the issues of  Overseas Domestic Workers' to Filipino workers, although this is still somewhat problemmatic as some of our respondents may have been granted leave to remain.

I'll look into the NRM figures - this may be a better bet.

Many thanks for this, Caroline.  I think this is basically right, but note we don't need an adacency matrix.  I think it will be easier if I just write some functions In R: to do the neighborhood bootstrapping.

Selim: do you know R:?  If not, it would behoove you to learn it -- not just for this project but for others.
After the data cleaning, and the choice of indicators for the hidden population, it could be great if Selim could write some small functions in R: that take as input (1) a data-set and(2) the variable(s) we want to use and (3) the 'known sub-population sizes and and calculates the quantities in Caroline's protocol.  Though, please see the attached in which I have some questions and comments.
Please note that it is critical that we have the known size of at least one probe alter group (PAG).  We discussed the number of people going through the NRM (presumably in some specified time-frame e.g. the last 12 months).  The other obvious PAG is the number of DW in the UK (technically that have a mobile, but we can probably ignore that part).  Caroline mentioned this is not easy/ perhaps not possible.  I'll leave it to you two get these number(s).  It is extremely important that we have census-quality data for the size of the PAG.

With these, I can do the bootstrap.

Hi Scott,

Forgive me, but I am not familiar with what some of the notation that you use refers to but, if I am understanding you correctly, and if there is a social link between the two, then I think your assumption is plausible.  I agree that we can test the respective assumptions and see what effect they have on subsequent models.

 

I have started some rough drafts of the literature related to the Feehan and Salganik paper and the bootstrapping papers to which you directed us. I don't seem to have the ability to upload these to the shared drive that you have set up, which is why I have included them here.

Feehan and Salganik.docxBootstrapping Methods.docx

 

Perhaps we can discuss and agree expectations related to what we need to do and who has the capacity and ability to do it?

 

Selim and I have also discussed keeping a record of our explorations to help us write up the methodology - perhaps we can agree the best way to do this when we meet on Thursday. What time works best for you?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Sorry to be yet more scattered, but I had another idea, following on your NRM probe-alter idea.  Regarding visibility, if we are willing to make the herculean assumption that everyone a person $i \in H$ knows that have gone through the NRM, _also_ knows that $i$ is in H, then I think we are in business with the visibility quantity. This might (or might not) be a reasonable assumption:  An exploited worker who knows someone in NRM, likely has a reciprocal relationship (?) – the person in NRM likely knows the exploited worker is in H.  Maybe?  

 

At the end of the day, we will likely try out lots and lots of models with more or less dubious assumptions and report the interesting ones faithfully (as in, ‘to obtain visibility estimates we assume that blablabla.’  Or ‘we exclude such and such observations because blablabla’, etc.)

 

I’m generally a fan of ‘poking at’ the research question from many different angles (usually all quantitative, as is my nature 😊 )

 

Sorry for being so scattered and massive kudos to Caroline for taking on the challenge of making my scattered comments coherent (if they can be!)

 

Best,

Scott

Doh!  So sorry – yes of course, it even says ‘Numerical – count.’  So sorry!  So, yes, in principle.  But you need to know the ‘true size’ of these groups.  So 83 5f15 looks quite promising, b/c we know the number of people gone though NRM.  The others I’m not sure of.  But you both might know of data-sources that would provide ‘known sizes.’

 

Earlier is better, but I have a deadline on the 11th that I know I’m going to miss (and am aiming for the 12th).  So, the 14th AM is likely the most feasible.  But as I said, time is of the essence, for me at least.

 

In terms of boot-strapping.  Yea, the neighboorhood bootstrat is shockingly simple, and gives great results, and is already implemented in R:.  The issue is that Selim will have to make a copy of the data and get it into the format that the ‘neighborboot’ package ‘wants’ (check out the link I sent last email).

 

Yes, also, sorry for my scattered replies.  Please do reply as you see fit.

 

Best, 

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I'm responding to this and your other email in one thread. Thanks for the bootstrapping literature - I shall read this in more detail but the headline news is that I do think we have this data and Selim is happy to carry out the further data cleansing you suggest.

 

BTW, on the probe alters point below - they may still not be suitable probe alters, but the data are all numerical counts.

 

Very interested in the possibilities for constructing an index. Do you have a slot next week at one of the following times?

 

Tuesday 12th AM

Thursday 14th AM

Friday 15th anytime before 4pm

 

It would be great to move this forward with you  - thanks for agreeing to come on board. I understand the time constraints imposed by teaching, but hopefully we can find a way to work on this around our other commitments.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour 

 

Hi Scott,

 

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

 

[Scott Moser (staff)] Great!  And yes, Our ‘forced labor’ questions largely overlap.  I also had as possible indicators: Q36, Q21/25, Q35, Q83.  Just FYI.  But yes, we have multiple indicators.  We could either settle on one/ a few or build an index (see below).

 

 

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 

[Scott Moser (staff)] If I am understanding you, this is potentially a very cool idea.  I think you are suggesting constructing a new variable that indicates/captures the confidence we (as researchers) have that this particular person is in MS.  If so, this might connect to the ‘risk of MS’ literature, which seems to be a big policy focus.  And which is separate from the prevalence issue.  Are you thinking about something like a Likert scale?

 

I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 

[Scott Moser (staff)]Not to be negative, but I don’t think so.  Aren’t these questions 0/1 (as in ‘do you now someone’ yes/no?)  And for probe alters we need counts. 

 

Best wishes

Caroline

## 20230918_GNSUM Population estimates_text.txt
Date: 20230918
Subject: GNSUM Population estimates


Hi Scott and Selim,

I have now looked up the statistics related to the population estimates that we have discussed.

Referrals to the NRM
Perhaps the most robust are the UKs NRM figures. These start in April 2009, with the latest estimate available for the first quarter of 2023. Totally up these estimates gives a total of 73,019 referrals.

Calculated from the following subtotals: 
All referrals Jan to March 2023: 4,746
All referrals Jan to Dec 2022: 16,938
Positive reasonable grounds decisions at time of referral to the NRM (1st April 2009 - Dec 2021)(All adults, all minors and age unknown)* : 51,335

*This represents a slightly lower figure than all referrals (e.g. for the annual figures that are available for 2021 - 'all referrals' stand at 12,706 while 'positive grounds referrals for all adults, all minors and age unknown is reported at 11,371). 


The annual NRM figures reported between 2009-2021 are contained in the attached file, which I have downloaded from https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/14939numberofpotentialmodernslaveryvictimswithinthenationalreferralmechanismbyageandgenderukyearendingdecember2009toyearendingdecember2021

The figure for the year 2022 was 16,938, obtained from from  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2022/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2022

Further statistics are available for the first quarter of 2023 (Jan to Mar) with a further 4,746 referrals https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-january-to-march-2023/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-quarter-1-2023-january-to-march


Number of domestic workers in the UK
Previous NGO reports have used the Overseas Domestic Workers' Visa figure to estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK (see for example, recent blog by Trust for London https://trustforlondon.org.uk/news/domestic-workers-day-2022/#:~:text=Worldwide%20there%20are%2067%20million,wages%2C%20physical%20and%20sexual%20abuse., and earlier Kalayaan report http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/documents/Kalayaan%20Oxfam%20report.pdf).  Selim has found the most recent published statistics for this, which state that 19,780 overseas domestic worker visas were issued in the year to June 2023
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2023/why-do-people-come-to-the-uk-to-work

As I mentioned, this direct comparison is complicated by the fact that some of our respondents may have now have settled status, or may be in domestic work on an EEA visa (e.g. those from South America) and so is likely an underestimation of the true population ( and not even considering those in domestic work without the legal right to work)

We could perhaps clarify our sample and identify the sub set of those on 'tied' visas (we did ask this question) and then use this sub-sample for bootstrapping and comparison purposes. Selim - can you tell us how many respondents reported that they were on a tied visa?  or, alternatively/ in addition perhaps conduct some sort of sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of various levels of under-estimation.

I hope this helps,

Caroline

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have now been through the codebook and identified those questions that identify the respondent as a member of the hidden population of those at risk of forced labour. All 11 indicators are covered with the risk of forced labour increasing with the presence of more than one indicator. Questions that identify respondent as a member of the hidden population.docx

Scott - I hope that this is more what you had in mind? 

My next job is to revisit your comments related to the protocol. Would it be possible perhaps to give me access to review the latest version of the protocol document in the shared file so that I can add my comments as track changes?

## 20230925_Updated protocol_text.txt
Date: 20230925
Subject: Updated protocol

Hi Scott and Selim,

Thank you for the work that you have done on this over the weekend, Scott - and for sending me another link your annotations of the protocol document. I've now had another look at this and added further annotations to your observations. I hope that what is now described here may allow Selim to calculate point estimates for two respondent samples: a) all valid responses from domestic workers working in the UK (which we then compare to the most recent overall ODW visa numbers: noting the provisos about the visa categories that we have already discussed) and b) a sub-sample of filipino- only respondents (for which using an ODW visa estimate may be more realistic of the actual situation. These are described further in the shared document: Exploratory protocol based upon Feehan and Salganik (2016)SJM - CE.docx

I have also now included the probe alter calculation based upon the number of NRM referrals suggested by Scott - although I am not yet clear what further calculations we use this for.

So, what I think is happening now: Scott - teaching permitting, you are guiding Selim on data cleansing and bootstrapping the variance estimation (can this also be done for the two different samples, a and b)?

While Selim and I will work through point estimates for samples a) and b). Selim, if you can take a look at the revised attachment, we can discuss any issues in our routine meeting before the BEP team meeting tomorrow.

I hope that I have accurately reflected our earlier discussions here now.

Date: 20231023
Subject: Re: GNSUM meeting notes 20-10-2023

Hi Scott,

Firstly, I shall be eternally grateful to you for persisting with this. I greatly appreciate your insight. This project does not stand or fall by the use of a particular statistical technique which, if I understand your email correctly, is fortunate since our attempts to  use Feehan and Salganik's protocol seems to force us into making statistical assumptions about the relationship between our sample and its frame that we cannot justify.

I am sorry that I am not so familiar with the terminology that you have used, so I am not able to comment with any confidence  whether 'we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$.' If you are able to clarify this, then we can perhaps direct Selim with more confidence. 

 As far as I am concerned the big prize is a statistical viable population estimate - by a means that our data will support.

However, I am very pleased that you do seem to indicate that we might be able to proceed with a RDS/NSUM approach - this would seem to be very good news-  although I do recognise that in doing this, we would have to live with the drawbacks of the NSUM which again makes certain problematic assumptions (as detailed by Feehan and Salganik 2016). I also am glad that you think we do have ARD - if not enriched ARD.

The 'stop- start' process does not make this any easier as it is difficult to keep the technical detail of these procedures in one's head. Do you think that we could perhaps arrange an in-person Friday session (1/2 or full day?) for us to try and work through this between us - or, might another approach suit you better?

Unfortunately, I am in Portsmouth for a workshop this Friday, but I could clear my diary on 3 November if you think trying to work this through in a longer in-person session might be more efficient?

Caroline

Subject: Re: GNSUM meeting notes 20-10-2023 
 
Many thanks to all.  I'm afraid I write with some bad news.  But not as bad as I had earlier thought.  I have spend the afternoon (re-)wrapping my head around things, and reflecting on our meeting yesterday.  Today my approach was to (1) look for replication studies using NSUM/ GNSUM (2) look at the literature citing the original F&G 2016 paper and (3) start to look into alternative estimators, specifically look into papers that user RDS and NSUM to estimate the size of hidden populations.



### The bad news ###

I understand the Exploratory Protocol to be the steps to arrive at the estimate for the size of the hidden population using eqn. 23 of F&S (2016).  The 'innovation' of what they call the 'modified basic scale-up estimator'  is two fold:  First they use the average degree size of everyone in F to everyone in F (this makes sense);  then they use the size of the sample frame ($N_F$) rather than the total population size ($N$ in eqn. 22).  Specifically, in the right-most fraction.  That is the issue we discussed yesterday regarding the order in which the divisions were taken.  But technically speaking, that is incorrect.  I've tried to 'slice' this quantity in a number of ways, but I think we need the size of the sample frame, $N_F$, in any event.  And I really hope I am wrong!

To wit, the denominator of the right-most fraction of eqn. 23 involves _the size of the frame, F_.  Which we do not have.  Actually, it is worse than that, because we definitely to not have $\hat{d}_{F,F}$.  Now, I _think_ -- but do not know -- that what the Protocol it trying to do is to estimate these quantities from the sample ($s_F$).  I don't know if that is OK or not.  I would be more convinced if we knew s_F was a representative sample from F.  But I think this issue was discussed yesterday.

Alternatively, we can try to estimate the average degree from F to F (called $\hat{d}_{F,F}$) using the formula in the bottom-center 'orb' of Figure 4.  This is the 'known population scale-up' I was talking about yesterday.  I tried to dig deeper: $N_{\mathcal{A}}$ is the total size of all the 'probe alter' groups (aka 'pivot groups' or PG).  For use, we have one: the size of those that have gone through the NRM.  From page 161, this group (for us, in general _these_ groups) must belong to the sample frame, F.  So:
1.If we are going to use the known group-size to calculate the average personal degree size, then I think we need to assume that everyone that has gone through the NRM is part of the sample frame.  Is this true?  I very much doubt it, but again, I really hope I am wrong!
2.In the application(s) of GNSUM I've seen, specifically the following
Jing, L., Qu, C., Yu, H., Wang, T., & Cui, Y. (2014). Estimating the sizes of populations at high risk for HIV: A comparison study. PloS One, 9(4), e95601. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095601
they take a random sample from the population (frame in our case) and an RDS/ Vincent link tracing sample from the hidden population.  I understand we dont' have the latter, but I don't think we have the former, either (?).
2a.  I *think * have some replication materials from some NSUM/ GNSUM published studies.   Perhaps even the Jing et al.  I have simply forgotten since I last looked at this in depth in the spring.

I looked for any paper using their 'modified basic scale-up estimator' (eqn 23) but I couldn't find any. 🙁


### Now for the not-so bad news ###

If we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$, then I could see a case for the approach that Selim is currently coding up being useful.


### Now for the good news ###

The structure of the data is exactly a "RDS with ARD data collected from the sample frame of DW in the UK who have a mobile phone."  And there are loads of papers that deal with this type of data:

[RDS and measurements of a 'hidden population' papers]

I am only peripherally knowledgeable about RDS and inference.  And not at all about NSUM and RDS.  but it is out there, and we can try them out (?)


---

On my end, the 'start and stop' of research is _really_ inefficient.  And has shown to introduce errors.  So, my preference is to get this done asap, if we are going to get it done that is.

I hope we can chat further.  
Best,
scott

No problem Scott. I have looked again at the GFEMS recommendations and a NSUM and RDS combination is advocated here too. I shall make some time to dig into the literature that Blazek & Feehan and Kysia et al. cite in article 4 and article 6 respectively of the recent GFEMS methodological briefing - which can be found here: https://www.gfems.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Revised_GFEMS_MethodologiesBooklet.pdf and see if I can start to build this into our draft.

Hi Scott,

Firstly, I shall be eternally grateful to you for persisting with this. I greatly appreciate your insight. This project does not stand or fall by the use of a particular statistical technique which, if I understand your email correctly, is fortunate since our attempts to  use Feehan and Salganik's protocol seems to force us into making statistical assumptions about the relationship between our sample and its frame that we cannot justify.

I am sorry that I am not so familiar with the terminology that you have used, so I am not able to comment with any confidence  whether 'we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$.' If you are able to clarify this, then we can perhaps direct Selim with more confidence. 

 As far as I am concerned the big prize is a statistical viable population estimate - by a means that our data will support.

However, I am very pleased that you do seem to indicate that we might be able to proceed with a RDS/NSUM approach - this would seem to be very good news-  although I do recognise that in doing this, we would have to live with the drawbacks of the NSUM which again makes certain problematic assumptions (as detailed by Feehan and Salganik 2016). I also am glad that you think we do have ARD - if not enriched ARD.

The 'stop- start' process does not make this any easier as it is difficult to keep the technical detail of these procedures in one's head. Do you think that we could perhaps arrange an in-person Friday session (1/2 or full day?) for us to try and work through this between us - or, might another approach suit you better?

Unfortunately, I am in Portsmouth for a workshop this Friday, but I could clear my diary on 3 November if you think trying to work this through in a longer in-person session might be more efficient?

Best wishes
Caroline

Many thanks to all.  I'm afraid I write with some bad news.  But not as bad as I had earlier thought.  I have spend the afternoon (re-)wrapping my head around things, and reflecting on our meeting yesterday.  Today my approach was to (1) look for replication studies using NSUM/ GNSUM (2) look at the literature citing the original F&G 2016 paper and (3) start to look into alternative estimators, specifically look into papers that user RDS and NSUM to estimate the size of hidden populations.

 

 

 

### The bad news ###

 

I understand the Exploratory Protocol to be the steps to arrive at the estimate for the size of the hidden population using eqn. 23 of F&S (2016).  The 'innovation' of what they call the 'modified basic scale-up estimator'  is two fold:  First they use the average degree size of everyone in F to everyone in F (this makes sense);  then they use the size of the sample frame ($N_F$) rather than the total population size ($N$ in eqn. 22).  Specifically, in the right-most fraction.  That is the issue we discussed yesterday regarding the order in which the divisions were taken.  But technically speaking, that is incorrect.  I've tried to 'slice' this quantity in a number of ways, but I think we need the size of the sample frame, $N_F$, in any event.  And I really hope I am wrong!

 

To wit, the denominator of the right-most fraction of eqn. 23 involves _the size of the frame, F_.  Which we do not have.  Actually, it is worse than that, because we definitely to not have $\hat{d}_{F,F}$.  Now, I _think_ -- but do not know -- that what the Protocol it trying to do is to estimate these quantities from the sample ($s_F$).  I don't know if that is OK or not.  I would be more convinced if we knew s_F was a representative sample from F.  But I think this issue was discussed yesterday.

 

Alternatively, we can try to estimate the average degree from F to F (called $\hat{d}_{F,F}$) using the formula in the bottom-center 'orb' of Figure 4.  This is the 'known population scale-up' I was talking about yesterday.  I tried to dig deeper: $N_{\mathcal{A}}$ is the total size of all the 'probe alter' groups (aka 'pivot groups' or PG).  For use, we have one: the size of those that have gone through the NRM.  From page 161, this group (for us, in general _these_ groups) must belong to the sample frame, F.  So:

1.If we are going to use the known group-size to calculate the average personal degree size, then I think we need to assume that everyone that has gone through the NRM is part of the sample frame.  Is this true?  I very much doubt it, but again, I really hope I am wrong!

2.In the application(s) of GNSUM I've seen, specifically the following

Jing, L., Qu, C., Yu, H., Wang, T., & Cui, Y. (2014). Estimating the sizes of populations at high risk for HIV: A comparison study. PloS One, 9(4), e95601. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095601

they take a random sample from the population (frame in our case) and an RDS/ Vincent link tracing sample from the hidden population.  I understand we dont' have the latter, but I don't think we have the former, either (?).

2a.  I *think * have some replication materials from some NSUM/ GNSUM published studies.   Perhaps even the Jing et al.  I have simply forgotten since I last looked at this in depth in the spring.

 

I looked for any paper using their 'modified basic scale-up estimator' (eqn 23) but I couldn't find any. 🙁

 

 

### Now for the not-so bad news ###

 

If we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$, then I could see a case for the approach that Selim is currently coding up being useful.

 

 

### Now for the good news ###

 

The structure of the data is exactly a "RDS with ARD data collected from the sample frame of DW in the UK who have a mobile phone."  And there are loads of papers that deal with this type of data:

 

[RDS and measurements of a 'hidden population' papers]

 

I am only peripherally knowledgeable about RDS and inference.  And not at all about NSUM and RDS.  but it is out there, and we can try them out (?)

No problem Scott. I have looked again at the GFEMS recommendations and a NSUM and RDS combination is advocated here too. I shall make some time to dig into the literature that Blazek & Feehan and Kysia et al. cite in article 4 and article 6 respectively of the recent GFEMS methodological briefing - which can be found here: https://www.gfems.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Revised_GFEMS_MethodologiesBooklet.pdf and see if I can start to build this into our draft.

Hi Scott,

 

Firstly, I shall be eternally grateful to you for persisting with this. I greatly appreciate your insight. This project does not stand or fall by the use of a particular statistical technique which, if I understand your email correctly, is fortunate since our attempts to  use Feehan and Salganik's protocol seems to force us into making statistical assumptions about the relationship between our sample and its frame that we cannot justify.

 

I am sorry that I am not so familiar with the terminology that you have used, so I am not able to comment with any confidence  whether 'we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$.' If you are able to clarify this, then we can perhaps direct Selim with more confidence. 



 As far as I am concerned the big prize is a statistical viable population estimate - by a means that our data will support.

 

However, I am very pleased that you do seem to indicate that we might be able to proceed with a RDS/NSUM approach - this would seem to be very good news-  although I do recognise that in doing this, we would have to live with the drawbacks of the NSUM which again makes certain problematic assumptions (as detailed by Feehan and Salganik 2016). I also am glad that you think we do have ARD - if not enriched ARD.

 

The 'stop- start' process does not make this any easier as it is difficult to keep the technical detail of these procedures in one's head. Do you think that we could perhaps arrange an in-person Friday session (1/2 or full day?) for us to try and work through this between us - or, might another approach suit you better?

 

Unfortunately, I am in Portsmouth for a workshop this Friday, but I could clear my diary on 3 November if you think trying to work this through in a longer in-person session might be more efficient?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Many thanks to all.  I'm afraid I write with some bad news.  But not as bad as I had earlier thought.  I have spend the afternoon (re-)wrapping my head around things, and reflecting on our meeting yesterday.  Today my approach was to (1) look for replication studies using NSUM/ GNSUM (2) look at the literature citing the original F&G 2016 paper and (3) start to look into alternative estimators, specifically look into papers that user RDS and NSUM to estimate the size of hidden populations.

 

 

 

### The bad news ###

 

I understand the Exploratory Protocol to be the steps to arrive at the estimate for the size of the hidden population using eqn. 23 of F&S (2016).  The 'innovation' of what they call the 'modified basic scale-up estimator'  is two fold:  First they use the average degree size of everyone in F to everyone in F (this makes sense);  then they use the size of the sample frame ($N_F$) rather than the total population size ($N$ in eqn. 22).  Specifically, in the right-most fraction.  That is the issue we discussed yesterday regarding the order in which the divisions were taken.  But technically speaking, that is incorrect.  I've tried to 'slice' this quantity in a number of ways, but I think we need the size of the sample frame, $N_F$, in any event.  And I really hope I am wrong!

 

To wit, the denominator of the right-most fraction of eqn. 23 involves _the size of the frame, F_.  Which we do not have.  Actually, it is worse than that, because we definitely to not have $\hat{d}_{F,F}$.  Now, I _think_ -- but do not know -- that what the Protocol it trying to do is to estimate these quantities from the sample ($s_F$).  I don't know if that is OK or not.  I would be more convinced if we knew s_F was a representative sample from F.  But I think this issue was discussed yesterday.

 

Alternatively, we can try to estimate the average degree from F to F (called $\hat{d}_{F,F}$) using the formula in the bottom-center 'orb' of Figure 4.  This is the 'known population scale-up' I was talking about yesterday.  I tried to dig deeper: $N_{\mathcal{A}}$ is the total size of all the 'probe alter' groups (aka 'pivot groups' or PG).  For use, we have one: the size of those that have gone through the NRM.  From page 161, this group (for us, in general _these_ groups) must belong to the sample frame, F.  So:

1.If we are going to use the known group-size to calculate the average personal degree size, then I think we need to assume that everyone that has gone through the NRM is part of the sample frame.  Is this true?  I very much doubt it, but again, I really hope I am wrong!

2.In the application(s) of GNSUM I've seen, specifically the following

Jing, L., Qu, C., Yu, H., Wang, T., & Cui, Y. (2014). Estimating the sizes of populations at high risk for HIV: A comparison study. PloS One, 9(4), e95601. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095601

they take a random sample from the population (frame in our case) and an RDS/ Vincent link tracing sample from the hidden population.  I understand we dont' have the latter, but I don't think we have the former, either (?).

2a.  I *think * have some replication materials from some NSUM/ GNSUM published studies.   Perhaps even the Jing et al.  I have simply forgotten since I last looked at this in depth in the spring.

 

I looked for any paper using their 'modified basic scale-up estimator' (eqn 23) but I couldn't find any. 🙁

[RDS and measurements of a 'hidden population' papers]

 

I am only peripherally knowledgeable about RDS and inference.  And not at all about NSUM and RDS.  but it is out there, and we can try them out (?)

On my end, the 'start and stop' of research is _really_ inefficient.  And has shown to introduce errors.  So, my preference is to get this done asap, if we are going to get it done that is.

 

I hope we can chat further.

## 20231103_Revised approach to RDS-NSUM estimation_text.txt
Date: 20231103
Subject: Revised approach to RDS/NSUM estimation

Hi Selim,

I hope you enjoyed your trip to Turkey. Following Scott's observation that we have collected RDS data on the frame population rather than focusing on the hidden population, we have discussed some possible ways forward and agreed that we trim our data to include only those respondents who identify that their circumstances could be considered abusive - taking the widest possible spectrum of abuse (i.e. including behaviours such as verbal abuse and all other indicators of exploitation). Since 82% of our sample reported verbal abuse, we are hoping that this approach means that we can keep a high proportion of our respondents in our analysis

This approach - and the generation of a risk index - requires some elaboration and further coding of our data set. 

That being the case, would you be able and willing to carry out the following tasks?

Insert a new column for each of the 13 possible risk categories identified (as indicated in the attachment to this email) and, where the respondent indicates that they have experienced each particular form of abuse, assign the weight indicated  into the cell (0 would indicate that that respondent did not report any abuse of that type)

Insert a 'sum' risk category column - which then sums all the weighted risks for each of the 13 abuse categories to give an index value between 0 (no abuse of any kind) and 1( all forms of abuse reported)
Insert one further new column indicating for each respondent whether they report any type of exploitation (broadly defined) coded 0 for no abuse reported and 1 for any  type of abuse reported. (Again, you can use the questions that indicate abuse found in the attached document). It would be useful if you could then let us know how many respondents this leaves in our sample.
If this makes sense to you, do you think that you can press ahead with this coding send through the updated data set to me and Scott? 

If anything here is unclear - or you would like to discuss the weightings I've assigned (which are indeed somewhat subjective) and you'd like a quick chat with me first we can schedule a call next week. 

If you're available, Scott has already sent through a meeting invitation for us all meet again next Friday - for an update on progress/ agree our next steps.

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Dr Moser, 

Thank you for your email. 

Please see the updated codebook (November version). I have also made adjustments to the further coding (attached). 

In terms of the variable naming, please try to ignore the ones with alphabets (e.g. 2b, 5f12...), as they were used when we designed the questions. The variables of Q1, Q2, Q3... are the clarified variable names that we are using now. I hope this is helpful. 

Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions. 

With kind regards,

Thanks all!  I’m working on this and have a few questions that need answers.

From Caroline’s word doc, I see that Category 13 is based on “80: 5f12”.  But in Selim’s xlsx file, there is only the variable “Q80”.  Further, this variable has values like 2 and 5 and zero.  What variable corresponds to which?  

Also, I will need a codebook to do the scale up.  Is there a consistent variable naming and question numbering?  With a codebook, please?

Dear Caroline and Dr Moser,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Please see attached the tasks for further coding. I created 13 new columns for each category of exploitation, one new column for the sum of exploitation weight (Sum_categories), and another column for whether or not there is any type of exploitation (Whether_exploitation). This coding has shown that all respondents face some level of exploitation, and the number of sample is still the same (n=97).

 

Please let me know if there is anything else.

 

Thank you.

Hi Selim,

 

I hope you enjoyed your trip to Turkey. Following Scott's observation that we have collected RDS data on the frame population rather than focusing on the hidden population, we have discussed some possible ways forward and agreed that we trim our data to include only those respondents who identify that their circumstances could be considered abusive - taking the widest possible spectrum of abuse (i.e. including behaviours such as verbal abuse and all other indicators of exploitation). Since 82% of our sample reported verbal abuse, we are hoping that this approach means that we can keep a high proportion of our respondents in our analysis

 

This approach - and the generation of a risk index - requires some elaboration and further coding of our data set. 

 

That being the case, would you be able and willing to carry out the following tasks?

 

Insert a new column for each of the 13 possible risk categories identified (as indicated in the attachment to this email) and, where the respondent indicates that they have experienced each particular form of abuse, assign the weight indicated  into the cell (0 would indicate that that respondent did not report any abuse of that type)
Insert a 'sum' risk category column - which then sums all the weighted risks for each of the 13 abuse categories to give an index value between 0 (no abuse of any kind) and 1( all forms of abuse reported)
Insert one further new column indicating for each respondent whether they report any type of exploitation (broadly defined) coded 0 for no abuse reported and 1 for any  type of abuse reported. (Again, you can use the questions that indicate abuse found in the attached document). It would be useful if you could then let us know how many respondents this leaves in our sample.
If this makes sense to you, do you think that you can press ahead with this coding send through the updated data set to me and Scott? 

 

If anything here is unclear - or you would like to discuss the weightings I've assigned (which are indeed somewhat subjective) and you'd like a quick chat with me first we can schedule a call next week. 

 

If you're available, Scott has already sent through a meeting invitation for us all meet again next Friday - for an update on progress/ agree our next steps.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Scott,

I've located the codebook.

Question 5f12 has six possible values (1-6) Perhaps Selim can advise as to the zero (possibly question not answered?

Thanks all!  I’m working on this and have a few questions that need answers.

From Caroline’s word doc, I see that Category 13 is based on “80: 5f12”.  But in Selim’s xlsx file, there is only the variable “Q80”.  Further, this variable has values like 2 and 5 and zero.  What variable corresponds to which?  

Also, I will need a codebook to do the scale up.  Is there a consistent variable naming and question numbering?  With a codebook, please?

 

Best,

Scott

These are really interesting findings, Scott. I agree that this figure seems high at first hearing - though there is grey literature that indicates exploitation problems are likely.

Thanks for you work on this - it is very useful to have these indications as I prepare a draft for us.

Dear All,

Just a quick update before I have to 'shelve' this for a while.^[I am sorry -- I Truely would like to work on this much more, but I have 4 hours of lecture and 4 hours of seminar next week and I am embarrassed to say I am not prepared for them at this moment.]

I have started to play with the estimates and I an say the following, bearing in mind that all of this is very preliminary​🙁

1.The proportion estimates come in at between 30-40% of the sample frame falling into the category of 'experiencing MS' (depending on how we operationalize this e.g. Q36 or Q80).  These figures are surprisingly stable to different parameters (e.g. 'priors') in the model. 
1a.I find these estimates really, really high.  Am I mistaken?  What do you all think?  On my end, if these are even close to accurate then there is a massive​ issue in DW employment in the UK (perhaps this is already known and I am just ignorant.  Or wrong!)
2.Regarding the distribution of the 'risk index': it turns out I did find a hack to get a (crude) estimate of the distribution of Risk Index (RI) scores from the model:
Gile's SS Estimate for sum_categories_cut
               Estimate           95% Interval Design Effect Std. Error     N

it looks to me like the distribution 'peaks' at about 1/4+(or maybe 1/3-ish?)  to about 1/2+ on our 0-1 scale.  (Sorry for not providing an visualization, which would  be much preferred!)


3.My hunch is that these results are due to the sample.  In particular a lack of sufficient 'waves' to reach RW equilibrium'.   I have not performed any diagnostic tests, so please take these preliminary results as 'tentative' at best!


I'm afraid I must 'park' this for the time being.

SELIM: 
1.do you know Git and GitHub?  I want to set up a GitHub for this project so we can share code/ results but I simply don't have time.  Can you set it up? I am more than happy to share code.
2.Can you double check that I am correctly using / interpreting the rows in your xlsx file in light of the formatting that is used in the RDS CRAN package?  That is, if you run the following:
```
install.packages("RDS")
library(RDS)
?as.rds.data.frame
```
And please take a look at the recruiter.id​ argument to make sure it corresponds correctly with how your have


Ok, I want to sleep, but I have to write lecture slides.  Hope to talk soon!

Selim is probably best placed to answer this one. From memory, I think we provided the ability to list up to 10 contacts - but Selim chose a more limited number when he sent out subsequent wave requests. Selim, could you please confirm the exact procedure you used?

Dear Dr Moser, 

Thank you for your email. 

Please see the updated codebook (November version). I have also made adjustments to the further coding (attached). 

In terms of the variable naming, please try to ignore the ones with alphabets (e.g. 2b, 5f12...), as they were used when we designed the questions. The variables of Q1, Q2, Q3... are the clarified variable names that we are using now. I hope this is helpful. 

Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions. 

With kind regards, 

Selim Yilmaz

Thanks all!  I’m working on this and have a few questions that need answers.

From Caroline’s word doc, I see that Category 13 is based on “80: 5f12”.  But in Selim’s xlsx file, there is only the variable “Q80”.  Further, this variable has values like 2 and 5 and zero.  What variable corresponds to which?  

Also, I will need a codebook to do the scale up.  Is there a consistent variable naming and question numbering?  With a codebook, please?

 

Best,

Scott

Dear Caroline and Dr Moser,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Please see attached the tasks for further coding. I created 13 new columns for each category of exploitation, one new column for the sum of exploitation weight (Sum_categories), and another column for whether or not there is any type of exploitation (Whether_exploitation). This coding has shown that all respondents face some level of exploitation, and the number of sample is still the same (n=97).

 

Please let me know if there is anything else.

 

Thank you.

Subject: Revised approach to RDS/NSUM estimation 

 

Hi Selim,

 

I hope you enjoyed your trip to Turkey. Following Scott's observation that we have collected RDS data on the frame population rather than focusing on the hidden population, we have discussed some possible ways forward and agreed that we trim our data to include only those respondents who identify that their circumstances could be considered abusive - taking the widest possible spectrum of abuse (i.e. including behaviours such as verbal abuse and all other indicators of exploitation). Since 82% of our sample reported verbal abuse, we are hoping that this approach means that we can keep a high proportion of our respondents in our analysis

 

This approach - and the generation of a risk index - requires some elaboration and further coding of our data set. 

 

That being the case, would you be able and willing to carry out the following tasks?

 

Insert a new column for each of the 13 possible risk categories identified (as indicated in the attachment to this email) and, where the respondent indicates that they have experienced each particular form of abuse, assign the weight indicated  into the cell (0 would indicate that that respondent did not report any abuse of that type)
Insert a 'sum' risk category column - which then sums all the weighted risks for each of the 13 abuse categories to give an index value between 0 (no abuse of any kind) and 1( all forms of abuse reported)
Insert one further new column indicating for each respondent whether they report any type of exploitation (broadly defined) coded 0 for no abuse reported and 1 for any  type of abuse reported. (Again, you can use the questions that indicate abuse found in the attached document). It would be useful if you could then let us know how many respondents this leaves in our sample.
If this makes sense to you, do you think that you can press ahead with this coding send through the updated data set to me and Scott? 

 

If anything here is unclear - or you would like to discuss the weightings I've assigned (which are indeed somewhat subjective) and you'd like a quick chat with me first we can schedule a call next week. 

 

If you're available, Scott has already sent through a meeting invitation for us all meet again next Friday - for an update on progress/ agree our next steps.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

## 20231124_First draft of our RDS paper_text.txt
Date: 20231124
Subject: First draft of our RDS paper

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have attached here a first draft of our RDS inspired paper. RDS paper draft 24-11-2023.docx

This is not perfect, by any means, - it really is my first draft -  but hopefully  it gives us something to edit polish and refine as we insert and position the RDS calculations. Selim - as you will see I have drawn heavily on your excellent annotated bibliographies. 

I hope that you are still able and willing to provide the detail for the additional - primarily methods, analysis and discussion- sections that I have indicated within this draft. Do please both feel free to correct any inaccuracies that I have introduced into the parts of the method and to expand on that which I have drafted.

I think we do have a meeting in the diary already, so hopefully you both have time at least to review the paper before we meet and we can then discuss the suggested additions/ overall direction.

I hope that you both have a fantastic weekend

Best wishes
Caroline

No no!  Not at all!  We all have our preferred ‘workflows.’  No problem at all.  

Funny timing: perhaps it is b/c I am getting sick of my current ‘routine’ (teaching, being ill, teaching, having health issues, marking, repeat) but I’m super excited to get back to research!

 

We have a meeting in December, I think?

No no!  Not at all!  We all have our preferred ‘workflows.’  No problem at all.  

Funny timing: perhaps it is b/c I am getting sick of my current ‘routine’ (teaching, being ill, teaching, having health issues, marking, repeat) but I’m super excited to get back to research!

 

We have a meeting in December, I think?

Stay healthy,

Scott

Happy to share - but I asked Selim to record his bibliographies in Word - I am sorry if this makes me seem like a dinosaur 🙁 Let me know if these documents would be any good for you?

PS.  Sorry if this is a bother, or nosey, or both, but do you mind sharing your bibliography Caroline?  That is, if you use Zotero, or Mendely or EndNote or anything else, it would help me to 'ingest' the references you cite.  Thanks!

Hi Scott and Selim,

 

I have attached here a first draft of our RDS inspired paper. RDS paper draft 24-11-2023.docx

 

This is not perfect, by any means, - it really is my first draft -  but hopefully  it gives us something to edit polish and refine as we insert and position the RDS calculations. Selim - as you will see I have drawn heavily on your excellent annotated bibliographies. 

 

I hope that you are still able and willing to provide the detail for the additional - primarily methods, analysis and discussion- sections that I have indicated within this draft. Do please both feel free to correct any inaccuracies that I have introduced into the parts of the method and to expand on that which I have drafted.

 

I think we do have a meeting in the diary already, so hopefully you both have time at least to review the paper before we meet and we can then discuss the suggested additions/ overall direction.

 

I hope that you both have a fantastic weekend

 

Best wishes

Caroline
