Thanks Caroline! 

### One: "Create a risk variable" 

Sorry if I'm being dense, but these questions are about _other people_, right?  I had thought -- and I might very well be wrong -- that we were going to use questions / indicators that could be used to identify persons experiencing MS. For example, and answer of (0) or (1) on 80. 5f12: Have you or someone you know personally been advised to enter the NRM? 
(0) I have been advised to enter the NRM and was referred
(1) I was advised, but decided not to enter the NRM
or 72. 5f4: Do you feel your working environment is safe and healthy?
70. 5f2: Has your employer, or their agent, withheld from you your travel and iden�ty documenta�on?
or 61. 5d8: Does your weekly rest last longer than 24 hours consecu�vely?
or an answer of 0-4 on 55. 5d4-b: Please mark, if you have NOT received any of the following (you can select more than one op�on)
or especially 50. 5d1 to 5d2-a (inclusive)
or espeically 45. 5c2, 46. 5c3, 47. 5c4, 42. 5b7: Has your pay ever been withheld by your employer?
32. 5a4: In your most recent job, have you ever felt that you could not leave your work premises?
30. 5a2: Do you have control over the �mes of the day that you work?
(espeically)  29. 5a1: Have you ever been forced to do any work by your employer or household against your will?

Maybe the following, but likely not.  Just some suggestions.
36. 5b1: How much are you paid an hour, before tax and other deduc�ons?
44. 5c1 -44.5c1-b
57. 5d4-c: Please mark if you have NOT received the following informa�on as part of your contract (you can select more than one op�on):
or 63. 5d10: Do you feel you suffer from a lack of privacy in your work? (maybe?)

Etc. These questions are about the self, not others.  The questions you highlighted are excellent potential indicators of the size of a personal network that includes members from the hidden population.  That is, these variables are great to us as different indicators for the size of H. 

But I see why you would send these -- I was speaking gibberish in our meeting regarding 'scaling up' when the DV isn't dichotomous.  I dont' think that is what we want to do.  Rather, I have/had it in my head that we would create a 'risk index' variable measuring an _individual's risk (propensity?) of experiencing MS_.  If so, then there is no 'scaling up.'  Rather, we would use the risk index variable as the DV in a regression model.  Sorry for talking nonsense in the meeting.[^  Though, intellectually i like the idea of thinking about what 'scaling up' even means when the variable in question isn't a count.  I can't say even know what that means, since 'scaling up' is explicitly about taking counts from individual social networks and using that information (along with other population-level information e.g. known group sizes) to estimate population-level counts (e.g. the size of H), but might be fun to think about.]

### Two

Once we have the 'know size(s)' we can crack on with the calculations.  I think your approach (eg. Philopeno visas) is a good idea.  At the end of the day, we can only work with the data we have.  

### Three

I think I have a pretty clear idea of what Selim and I need to do, coding-wise.   I hope he can automate the calculations, per your protocol (but did my comments/ questions make sense?  Or should I ignore them?).  And I can do the bootstrapping.  

I hope this makes sense (?)  Does it?


Thank you!

Scott

Thanks for this Scott. In answer to your question about which indicators could be combined to form an index, I believe that there are six.

I've now highlighted these in the linked GNSUM ILO indicators.docx document that I shared earlier.

On the census quality data - in terms of the DW population size the best that we can do for this is for a subset of our DW respondents - i.e. if we were only to estimate the hidden population among Filipino domestic workers (67 of our 97 respondents), then we can use the Government's Figure for the issues of  Overseas Domestic Workers' to Filipino workers, although this is still somewhat problemmatic as some of our respondents may have been granted leave to remain.

I'll look into the NRM figures - this may be a better bet.

Many thanks for this, Caroline.  I think this is basically right, but note we don't need an adacency matrix.  I think it will be easier if I just write some functions In R: to do the neighborhood bootstrapping.

Selim: do you know R:?  If not, it would behoove you to learn it -- not just for this project but for others.
After the data cleaning, and the choice of indicators for the hidden population, it could be great if Selim could write some small functions in R: that take as input (1) a data-set and(2) the variable(s) we want to use and (3) the 'known sub-population sizes and and calculates the quantities in Caroline's protocol.  Though, please see the attached in which I have some questions and comments.
Please note that it is critical that we have the known size of at least one probe alter group (PAG).  We discussed the number of people going through the NRM (presumably in some specified time-frame e.g. the last 12 months).  The other obvious PAG is the number of DW in the UK (technically that have a mobile, but we can probably ignore that part).  Caroline mentioned this is not easy/ perhaps not possible.  I'll leave it to you two get these number(s).  It is extremely important that we have census-quality data for the size of the PAG.

With these, I can do the bootstrap.

Hi Scott

 

I've sent through a calendar link for the meeting suggesting a 10.30 start. I hope that that gives you enough time for the coffee hit.

 

I agree with your agenda. We have Selim currently full time until the end of this month, so if you are happy to direct him, this could give us a head start on the data cleaning. I am happy to discuss what else needs to be done and allocate tasks as best we can later this morning.

 

Looking forward to moving this forward with you

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi All,

 

Sorry for being odd and inconsistent in arranging a meeting.  I can meet via Teams at 10:30am or 11am tomorrow, Thursday (i just have to wake up in time to consume lots and lots of coffee!)  I will do my best to read the documents that Caroline provided (thanks!)

Ihave had a peek at the neighborhood bootstraping articles/ CRAN packages.  Selim: you are going to want to get very familiar with the Neighboot​package, specifically the 

to.rds {Neighboot}

 

function.

 

I don't have an agenda nor 'plan' for our meeting tomorrow -- I hope one of you (or both of you?) do.  To my mind, the biggest issues are:

1.What is next?  What is the objective and what is the division of labour?  (I think we have answers to this, but it would help me to flesh them out and be clear.)

2.What are the data-requirements?  That is, what reshaping/cleaning/ 'wrangling' need be done?

3.Analysis: what do we want to do?  I think Caroline's memos and input are very helpful here, but again it would help me to be crystal clear on what/ which analysis we want to perform/ report.   

 

Caroline: if you have managed to cobble together something coherent from my scattered emails/ replies to emails, you are a STAR! And I'd love to see / know what you are thinking, in terms of an agenda/ way forward.

 

Talk to you all soon!

Scott

Hi Scott,

Forgive me, but I am not familiar with what some of the notation that you use refers to but, if I am understanding you correctly, and if there is a social link between the two, then I think your assumption is plausible.  I agree that we can test the respective assumptions and see what effect they have on subsequent models.

 

I have started some rough drafts of the literature related to the Feehan and Salganik paper and the bootstrapping papers to which you directed us. I don't seem to have the ability to upload these to the shared drive that you have set up, which is why I have included them here.

Feehan and Salganik.docxBootstrapping Methods.docx

 

Perhaps we can discuss and agree expectations related to what we need to do and who has the capacity and ability to do it?

 

Selim and I have also discussed keeping a record of our explorations to help us write up the methodology - perhaps we can agree the best way to do this when we meet on Thursday. What time works best for you?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Sorry to be yet more scattered, but I had another idea, following on your NRM probe-alter idea.  Regarding visibility, if we are willing to make the herculean assumption that everyone a person $i \in H$ knows that have gone through the NRM, _also_ knows that $i$ is in H, then I think we are in business with the visibility quantity. This might (or might not) be a reasonable assumption:  An exploited worker who knows someone in NRM, likely has a reciprocal relationship (?) – the person in NRM likely knows the exploited worker is in H.  Maybe?  

 

At the end of the day, we will likely try out lots and lots of models with more or less dubious assumptions and report the interesting ones faithfully (as in, ‘to obtain visibility estimates we assume that blablabla.’  Or ‘we exclude such and such observations because blablabla’, etc.)

 

I’m generally a fan of ‘poking at’ the research question from many different angles (usually all quantitative, as is my nature 😊 )

 

Sorry for being so scattered and massive kudos to Caroline for taking on the challenge of making my scattered comments coherent (if they can be!)

 

Best,

Scott

Doh!  So sorry – yes of course, it even says ‘Numerical – count.’  So sorry!  So, yes, in principle.  But you need to know the ‘true size’ of these groups.  So 83 5f15 looks quite promising, b/c we know the number of people gone though NRM.  The others I’m not sure of.  But you both might know of data-sources that would provide ‘known sizes.’

 

Earlier is better, but I have a deadline on the 11th that I know I’m going to miss (and am aiming for the 12th).  So, the 14th AM is likely the most feasible.  But as I said, time is of the essence, for me at least.

 

In terms of boot-strapping.  Yea, the neighboorhood bootstrat is shockingly simple, and gives great results, and is already implemented in R:.  The issue is that Selim will have to make a copy of the data and get it into the format that the ‘neighborboot’ package ‘wants’ (check out the link I sent last email).

 

Yes, also, sorry for my scattered replies.  Please do reply as you see fit.

 

Best, 

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I'm responding to this and your other email in one thread. Thanks for the bootstrapping literature - I shall read this in more detail but the headline news is that I do think we have this data and Selim is happy to carry out the further data cleansing you suggest.

 

BTW, on the probe alters point below - they may still not be suitable probe alters, but the data are all numerical counts.

 

Very interested in the possibilities for constructing an index. Do you have a slot next week at one of the following times?

 

Tuesday 12th AM

Thursday 14th AM

Friday 15th anytime before 4pm

 

It would be great to move this forward with you  - thanks for agreeing to come on board. I understand the time constraints imposed by teaching, but hopefully we can find a way to work on this around our other commitments.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour 

 

Hi Scott,

 

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

 

[Scott Moser (staff)] Great!  And yes, Our ‘forced labor’ questions largely overlap.  I also had as possible indicators: Q36, Q21/25, Q35, Q83.  Just FYI.  But yes, we have multiple indicators.  We could either settle on one/ a few or build an index (see below).

 

 

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 

[Scott Moser (staff)] If I am understanding you, this is potentially a very cool idea.  I think you are suggesting constructing a new variable that indicates/captures the confidence we (as researchers) have that this particular person is in MS.  If so, this might connect to the ‘risk of MS’ literature, which seems to be a big policy focus.  And which is separate from the prevalence issue.  Are you thinking about something like a Likert scale?

 

I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 

[Scott Moser (staff)]Not to be negative, but I don’t think so.  Aren’t these questions 0/1 (as in ‘do you now someone’ yes/no?)  And for probe alters we need counts. 

 

Best wishes

Caroline
