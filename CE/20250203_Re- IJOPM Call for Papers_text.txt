Hi Scott,

I can do 12 - 12.45 on Friday - I'll send through a link. Not sure that I am in a position to give you instructions but I've attached some notes that I made based on a trawl through our earlier email conversations in case these are helpful as a memory jogger.

Best wishes
Caroline

Hi Scott,

 

Lovely to hear from you. Glad to hear that you have got the marking out of the way. Friday is a good day for a Teams call. Anytime except between 12-2.30 or after 4pm would be good for me.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Caroline!

 

I am sorry for the long tardiness.  Jan was very stressful with marking, but done now!  I am so sorry your Spring term is busy with extra teaching.  We seem to be perfectly out of sync, I am afraid (= my spring teaching is rather light).    I want to return to our project and finish it off.  I confess I need a few days to reorient myself.  I honestly don’t remember where we are, but I know I have (at least) two  substantial tasks regarding analysis.  

What does your weekly schedule look like?  Teams on Friday?  Or if you have any instructions for me I’d welcome them!

 

Stay warm,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

Hope your marking is going well (if indeed this is what you are doing!)

 

The business school have announced a small pot of money to support the development of 4 * journal articles. This is worth a max of £2000 and must be spent by 31 July. Just flagging this in case this would help with our IJOPM analysis...

 

Further details can be found here: https://uniofnottm.sharepoint.com/sites/NUBSstaffinfo/SitePages/4--Output-Publication-Boost-Small-Grants-Funding.aspx

 

I am just about to disappear under a tsunami of teaching - so apologies if I am a bit slow to respond this term - it does not indicate a lack of interest.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Scott,

 

A very Happy New Year to you too. I hope that you have had a great time in Texas.  So glad that you think this is a good submission target for our work. I know two of the guest editors - both of whom have published in the modern slavery field and one of whom (Stefan Gold) used to be at Nottingham.

 

I've sketched out some answers to your first thoughts/questions below:

 

What is the timeline (e.g. for submission)?

 

Submissions open 1 June and close 30 September


-What are the constraints (e.g. word count/ appendix/ referencing/ etc.)?

 

Papers can be up to 12,000 words - this includes all text, references and appendixes. Any form of Harvard referencing is acceptable. We must also allow 280 words for each figure or table. There is the option to provide 'supplementary materials' (also peer reviewed) to be hosted via an IJOPM site or in a personal repository. . Full author guidelines can be found here: https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/ijopm

 

-- [Related] Who is the audience?  More specifically, to whom should we be crafting the manuscript for? (the reviewers?  The readers?  Who are these people?  Sorry for my ignorance, but I know very little about this Journal/ field.)

Initially, we obviously need to get this past the SI editorial team - and I think we stand a good chance of doing this. The main hurdle, I think, will be articulating our theoretical contribution to operations and supply chain management academics. The journal requires us to demonstrate both theoretical and methodological rigor and relevance. Operations management scholars use a range of quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. They will be largely business school researchers interested in ops management theory and managerial practice. Domestic work does fit within the private service sector - but we will need to make a case for its interest to ops management researchers and practitioners - perhaps advocating for a gendered sustainability lens? I have had an earlier paper on the care sector rejected from this journal since it was not deemed to be discipline-relevant so we will need to clearly articulate its relevance

-(SO SORRY but…) what do we have yet to do? [I am fairly certain there are at least two analyses that I have yet to perform.. I have some ‘ideas of a plan’ (yuk!) but do not know the specifics]

From memory, you had completed the RDS and we had agreed that it would be possible only to produce a proportional estimate of the hidden population size (compared with the estimated number of domestic workers in the UK rather than based on NRM referrals)- which I think you were still working on. You'd also mentioned sensitivity analyses. And there was the possibility of producing a composite risk index - not sure where you were with these.

 

Can we talk in late January?  Can we email in the meantime?

My teaching starts w/c 28 January  - so very happy (and free-er) to email/chat before this which you are back in the UK. Let me know when you're free and we can schedule a call.

 

I'm currently working on synthesising the earlier article drafts that I had sent through to you -checking Zotero is up to date - and have worked up a couple of introductory positioning paragraphs in response to the SI call. I'll send these through hopefully later today. Happy to continue to edit these as we finalise thinks but just trying to capture some of the journey as we go - so I hope they will be useful as we finalise the article submission.

 

 When I am in the UK I am almost always up for a Teams chat, if you have time + interest.

 

Just let me know when you are back in the UK and free for a chat.

 

I'm really glad you're still up for this, Scott. I am fully committed to getting this submission up and running and hope that the timeline may suit us.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

First, HAPPY NEW YEAR!  I hope you were able to enjoy the winter holidays and relax some, too.

 

I am sorry for not replying sooner.  This past Autumn was both the heaviest teaching and also my worst experience with admin and marking related duties.  In any event, it is a new year!  Thank you SO MUCH for this email!  I looked at International Journal of Operations & Production Management and I looks like a *wonderful* venue for our work!

I am in Texas at the moment, arriving back in the UK on Saturday  Yes, let us PLEASE meet and talk and submit to this special issue.  Sadly, I will be swamped with marking from Jan 6th.  But I will carve out time if need be to make sure we get this to fruition.

Some thoughts/ questions:

 

-What is the timeline (e.g. for submission)?
-What are the constraints (e.g. word count/ appendix/ referencing/ etc.)?

-- [Related] Who is the audience?  More specifically, to whom should we be crafting the manuscript for? (the reviewers?  The readers?  Who are these people?  Sorry for my ignorance, but I know very little about this Journal/ field.)

Again, thank you so much for brining on your project, and for your kind patience.  BTW: I am so sorry the Nuffield bid did not go through.  I really thought it was a good project proposal, and a great ‘team’.  Ah well.

 

All the best,

Scott

Perhaps we can meet in January before the start of the spring semester to discuss?
