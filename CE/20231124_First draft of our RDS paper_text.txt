Subject: First draft of our RDS paper

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have attached here a first draft of our RDS inspired paper. RDS paper draft 24-11-2023.docx

This is not perfect, by any means, - it really is my first draft -  but hopefully  it gives us something to edit polish and refine as we insert and position the RDS calculations. Selim - as you will see I have drawn heavily on your excellent annotated bibliographies. 

I hope that you are still able and willing to provide the detail for the additional - primarily methods, analysis and discussion- sections that I have indicated within this draft. Do please both feel free to correct any inaccuracies that I have introduced into the parts of the method and to expand on that which I have drafted.

I think we do have a meeting in the diary already, so hopefully you both have time at least to review the paper before we meet and we can then discuss the suggested additions/ overall direction.

I hope that you both have a fantastic weekend

Best wishes
Caroline
