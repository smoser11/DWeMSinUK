Subject: Dichotomous variables and risk index version 2

Hi Selim,

Here is the new coding scheme for the revised risk index and two dichotomous variables as conceptualised by Scott. 

I am not sure whether this is self-explanatory or not - take a look and let me know if it would help to have a chat. If it does make sense to you, do please go ahead with the coding.

Many thanks and best wishes,
