Subject: Checking in

Hi Scott,

Hope that you had a good Easter break. Just checking in to see how things are going with you? I finish teaching at the end of this week, and then have a brief respite before examination marking at the beginning of June. This is a window of opportunity if there is more that I can do my end to progress our BJM paper.

Best wishes
Caroline
