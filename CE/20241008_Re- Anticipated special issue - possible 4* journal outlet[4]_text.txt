Hi Scott,

I have a match with your availability anytime on Monday 28th or Thursday 31st in the afternoon - though this would be more convenient for me to have a Teams meeting on one of these days. If this is not possible, at a pinch I could do Thursday after 2pm face to face? 

To refresh my memory , I intend to go back through our email conversations, picking up the literature you have cited and returning to the various draft papers that I prepared in which I tried to capture our thinking at the time. 

Thanks for making time to talk about this in your teaching term. I'll let you know if I see the special issue call. Have you managed to get your Nuffield bid in?

Best wishes
Caroline

Hi Scott,

 

I have replied separately to your email about the Nuffield project. I am aware that there has been water under the bridge since your wrote, but do please come back to me if you think I can be of further help on this before the submission deadline. Nick has added me to the relevant team.

 

Very happy to meet mid October. Just let me know when would suit you?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

I hope you are enjoying your time off and getting some well-deserved rest. Thank you for your kind note, and there’s absolutely no need to apologize for the delay—it's completely understandable given the end-of-term rush.

I agree that a meeting to revisit and park the project is a good idea. I’m aware that we’ll both be balancing quite a few tasks, but perhaps we could aim to meet in mid-October when I’m more settled into my teaching schedule, and you’ve had a chance to catch up. I believe this will give us the chance to ensure we're aligned and make sure the paper comes together as planned.

In the meantime, I wanted to update you on my ongoing work for the Nuffield Foundation grant. As you’ll see in the attached project outline and draft application, the focus is on comparing different methods for estimating the prevalence of hidden populations. Zoe and Karen at the RL put your time on the project at 10% over the two years, which I hope is agreeable. I'm excited about the potential of this project and how it intersects with our work on domestic workers and modern slavery.

In a recent meeting with Zoe, Nick, and Todd at the Rights Lab, there was strong support for the direction of our research, particularly regarding your contributions and Selim’s. I think the Nuffield grant offers an excellent opportunity to build on this momentum.

I do, however, have some questions about refining the focus population for the grant. Initially, I had considered centering the project around domestic workers, given your expertise. But I’ve been reflecting on whether domestic servitude is the best fit for this type of estimation study. One challenge I foresee is that individuals in this hidden population may not always self-identify as part of it. Your work in operationalizing indicators of exploitation through indirect questioning in the survey was excellent, and I’m wondering if we need to employ a similar approach here.

Specifically, I’m thinking about the phrasing of questions when using methods like the Generalized Network Scale-Up (G-NSUM). Instead of asking respondents directly about how many exploited domestic workers they know, perhaps we should use broader phrasing—such as “How many domestic workers do you know?”—to avoid relying on respondents recognizing exploitation themselves. This could provide us with a clearer picture without placing undue pressure on respondents to identify exploitation directly.

I would love to hear your thoughts on these points, especially regarding whether domestic workers remain the most suitable hidden population for this study and how we might refine our methodology.

Looking forward to catching up when you’re back, and thank you again for your continued support on this project.  I’m really looking forward to working with you again!!!

Best wishes,
Scott

Hi Scott,

Apologies for the delayed response. I am taking some annual leave and trying to clear some urgent tasks off my to do list. If I may, I shall respond more fully upon my return at the beginning of October. I appreciate that you will be teaching, but I shall aim to address the jobs that you indicate in the forthcoming semester - my teaching again falls next year.

 

...and to add, a meeting to park the project is a very good idea. I fear you will be in teaching mode when I return, but if you would like to suggest a future date, I shall get up to speed again on my end. I too would very much like to deliver a good paper on this project - I think we have a lot to say

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Caroline!

 

It is wonderful to hear from you!    Funny timing, too: “reply to CE” is at the top of my “DO THIS BEFORE TEACHING STARTS” list.

 

That is great news re: journal venue.  Just FYI, I was looking at my notes and saw we had discussed these, too:

Here are some of the journals discussed as publication venues:

●

Journal of Modern Slavery (

) This journal focuses on the application of methods to address modern slavery. It might be interested in the research because it aligns with recommendations from the Global Fund for ending modern slavery (GFMS). While not a high-ranking journal, it could be suitable because it prioritizes practical examples and impactful applications over methodological purity.

●

Work, Employment and Society (

) This is a reputable, three-star journal with a sociological focus that has published studies on domestic workers. It might be a suitable venue due to its subject matter relevance, even though it leans towards a theoretical approach.

●

British Journal of Management (BJM) (

) This is a highly regarded journal with a quantitative bias that may favor the statistical nature of the research. Its focus on UK-related topics makes it a suitable venue for research utilizing UK statistics.

 

 

I’m afraid I need to put this project in ‘park’ until teaching settles down for me.  I was trying to get things organized for when we (I) pick it back up again.

 

 

I think the next steps are as follows:

1.       'Manually' implement the neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference (Scott); 

2.       1a) Oh, there is the remaining issue of the ‘known size’ group.  To do scale-up we need some way to estimate the size of a persons’ social network.  This is usually done by asking ‘How many X do you know?’ and comparing their answer to the know group size of group X (e.g. people named John)  There was some issue we were having about this.  But I think it only matters for NSUM, and not RDS (?)

 

2) implement whatever the correct equation is from the Feehan and Salgnic (sp?) 2016 to perform NSUM estimation on RDS data (Scott); 

 

3) figure out how to fairly compare estimates from RDS estimation and NSUM estimation. This last part involves finding/creating variables based on the survey codebook that allow for 'proper' comparison of estimates from the two methods (CE and SJM); A key challenge is ensuring a fair comparison between estimates derived from RDS and NSUM. This involves finding or creating variables from the survey codebook that enable a "proper" comparison between the two methods.  E.g. we use Q36 and Q70 as dichotomous variables when performing RDS estimation.   If I am remembering correctly, there is a discrepancy between "egocentric" questions (focused on the respondent's experience) and questions about the respondent's knowledge of others' experiences.  Questions like questions for ‘how many people in H (=the hidden population)’ – e.g. Q33. 5a5 , Q33. 5a7, Q49. 5c6 

Q64. 5d11 

Q83. 5f16 

Q88. 5f16 

Q89. 5f15 

-- don’t exactly match up with q36 and q80 that we use in the RDS estimation. 

 

 

4) I had thought we had a discussion about the role of 'social networks' in the two estimation methods (RDS and NSUM). I have a vague memory of talking with CE about how the 'personal network' entered into the different estimation techniques.  Or perhaps it was how model-based and design-based RDS estimators ‘use’ social network data differently.  The main point – I think – was a subtle methodological one but gave some insight into sensitivity to priors/ parameters.

 

5) There is something about ‘treacherous’ Bayesain posterior distributions(??)

 

Does any of this ring a bell?  Sorry again for being such a bad co-author on this, Caroline.  I *am* excited to finish it and I *am* (VERY) excited at the prospect of working with you on the Nuffield grant re: domestic servitude.

Would it help to have a conversation in order to put this project in ‘park’ so that we can resume easily when time permits?

 

Sorry for rambling.  I just do not want to forget abou this!

 

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I hope that you are well and had a well-earned break over the summer. I was at a conference earlier this week and Linda Hendry, one of the guest editors, told me that there is to be a special issue related on labour exploitation due to be announced by the International Journal of Operations and Production Management . This is a very good journal and the timeframe may suit us well - with an expected submission date around February 2025. Linda believes our DW research may be a good fit for what they are trying to achieve with the special issue

 

I'll keep an eye out for the formal call and send it across as soon as I see it. In the meantime, do let me know if it would help to catch up now - or perhaps once we have the call

 

Best wishes

Caroline
