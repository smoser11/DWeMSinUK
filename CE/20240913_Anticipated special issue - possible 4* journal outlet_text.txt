Subject: Anticipated special issue - possible 4* journal outlet

Hi Scott,

I hope that you are well and had a well-earned break over the summer. I was at a conference earlier this week and Linda Hendry, one of the guest editors, told me that there is to be a special issue related on labour exploitation due to be announced by the International Journal of Operations and Production Management . This is a very good journal and the timeframe may suit us well - with an expected submission date around February 2025. Linda believes our DW research may be a good fit for what they are trying to achieve with the special issue

I'll keep an eye out for the formal call and send it across as soon as I see it. In the meantime, do let me know if it would help to catch up now - or perhaps once we have the call

Best wishes
Caroline
