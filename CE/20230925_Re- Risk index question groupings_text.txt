Good morning.

I've been thinking more about this over the weekend and I still don't think this protocol is quite there yet. I'm going to spend some time on it this morning and will come back to you soon with an updated version.

Best wishes

Yes exactly.  Thank you.  Also, why are there multiple numbering of survey questions?  Could we perhaps agree on one?

I have uploaded my 'comments' to OneDrive and shared them with both of you.  I still owe you more emails.  But I have Welcome Week activities Monday, Tuesday and Friday this week.

Exploratory protocol based upon Feehan and Salganik (2016)SJM.docx

Take care.  I hope we can talk soon,
scott

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have now been through the codebook and identified those questions that identify the respondent as a member of the hidden population of those at risk of forced labour. All 11 indicators are covered with the risk of forced labour increasing with the presence of more than one indicator. Questions that identify respondent as a member of the hidden population.docx

Scott - I hope that this is more what you had in mind? 

My next job is to revisit your comments related to the protocol. Would it be possible perhaps to give me access to review the latest version of the protocol document in the shared file so that I can add my comments as track changes?

Best wishes
Caroline
