Subject: Updated BJM draft and author guidelines for BJM 'Methodology corner'

Hi Scott and Selim,

The author guidelines state:

Our finished article should be no more than 6,000 words, excluding  abstract, references, figures and tables. 

I've attached my latest draft, an updated version of the Zotero file and a link  (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1467-8551.12064?saml_referrer)  to a published 'methodology corner ' article that gives a feel for what they're after. 

I feel that the attached content will need further reshaping to fit the bill, but am sharing these details to check that you're happy with  where I'm heading

I'm now away for a week before the start of term, but will pick this up again on my return, and incorporate any feedback that you have time to give in the meanwhile.

Selim, I've copied you for information - I know that when we last communicated you did not want to be listed as an author but let me know if this changes.

Best wishes 
Caroline
