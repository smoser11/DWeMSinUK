Dear Scott Moser

 

Darkness to Data: Improving Prevalence Estimates of Domestic Servitude

 

Thank you for submitting your outline application.

 

We will undertake a review of the application and then be in touch with a decision on proceeding to the full application stage. However, please be aware that we receive a large number of outlines for these rounds and it takes some time to read them carefully and consult with Trustees where appropriate. As such, it is likely to be around 3 months before we are able to let you know whether or not your application has been shortlisted.

 

Regards,

Nuffield Foundation
