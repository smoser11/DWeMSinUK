Hi Scott,

Tuesday at 11 is fine for me. I have edited the meeting link accordingly. I think your outlook may be automatically declining new invitations, so do please let me know if you need be to forward the link to you some other way.

Selim, could you please export the data from our JISC survey so that Scott can take a look?

Thanks again for accommodating us, Scott. I really appreciate it

Best wishes
Caroline

Sp sorry, but I’ve been  ill the past few days and as a result not s Le to properly prepare for our meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, Monday.
Can I please ask that we postpone it until Tuesday at the same time? Or at some point later this week?
