Subject: Draft articles for information

Hi Scott,

For ease of reference, I've attached here again the beginnings of the narrative for our SI submission.
RDS paper draft 07-01-2025.docx
British Journal of Management Draft 18-04-2024.docx

I've updated the 'RDS' file, which I think could provide the introduction to our IJOPM piece.

The previous 'BJM' file is included in case any of this methodologically description may still be relevant to extract - though I have not attempted to do that yet.

Best wishes
Caroline
