...and to add, a meeting to park the project is a very good idea. I fear you will be in teaching mode when I return, but if you would like to suggest a future date, I shall get up to speed again on my end. I too would very much like to deliver a good paper on this project - I think we have a lot to say

Best wishes

Hi Scott,
Apologies for the delayed response. I am taking some annual leave and trying to clear some urgent tasks off my to do list. If I may, I shall respond more fully upon my return at the beginning of October. I appreciate that you will be teaching, but I shall aim to address the jobs that you indicate in the forthcoming semester - my teaching again falls next year.

Best wishes
Caroline

Hi Caroline!

 

It is wonderful to hear from you!    Funny timing, too: “reply to CE” is at the top of my “DO THIS BEFORE TEACHING STARTS” list.

 

That is great news re: journal venue.  Just FYI, I was looking at my notes and saw we had discussed these, too:

Here are some of the journals discussed as publication venues:

●

Journal of Modern Slavery (

) This journal focuses on the application of methods to address modern slavery. It might be interested in the research because it aligns with recommendations from the Global Fund for ending modern slavery (GFMS). While not a high-ranking journal, it could be suitable because it prioritizes practical examples and impactful applications over methodological purity.

●

Work, Employment and Society (

) This is a reputable, three-star journal with a sociological focus that has published studies on domestic workers. It might be a suitable venue due to its subject matter relevance, even though it leans towards a theoretical approach.

●

British Journal of Management (BJM) (

) This is a highly regarded journal with a quantitative bias that may favor the statistical nature of the research. Its focus on UK-related topics makes it a suitable venue for research utilizing UK statistics.

 

 

I’m afraid I need to put this project in ‘park’ until teaching settles down for me.  I was trying to get things organized for when we (I) pick it back up again.

 

 

I think the next steps are as follows:
'Manually' implement the neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference (Scott); 
1a) Oh, there is the remaining issue of the ‘known size’ group.  To do scale-up we need some way to estimate the size of a persons’ social network.  This is usually done by asking ‘How many X do you know?’ and comparing their answer to the know group size of group X (e.g. people named John)  There was some issue we were having about this.  But I think it only matters for NSUM, and not RDS (?)
 

2) implement whatever the correct equation is from the Feehan and Salgnic (sp?) 2016 to perform NSUM estimation on RDS data (Scott); 

 

3) figure out how to fairly compare estimates from RDS estimation and NSUM estimation. This last part involves finding/creating variables based on the survey codebook that allow for 'proper' comparison of estimates from the two methods (CE and SJM); A key challenge is ensuring a fair comparison between estimates derived from RDS and NSUM. This involves finding or creating variables from the survey codebook that enable a "proper" comparison between the two methods.  E.g. we use Q36 and Q70 as dichotomous variables when performing RDS estimation.   If I am remembering correctly, there is a discrepancy between "egocentric" questions (focused on the respondent's experience) and questions about the respondent's knowledge of others' experiences.  Questions like questions for ‘how many people in H (=the hidden population)’ – e.g. Q33. 5a5 , Q33. 5a7, Q49. 5c6 

Q64. 5d11 

Q83. 5f16 

Q88. 5f16 

Q89. 5f15 

-- don’t exactly match up with q36 and q80 that we use in the RDS estimation. 

 

 

4) I had thought we had a discussion about the role of 'social networks' in the two estimation methods (RDS and NSUM). I have a vague memory of talking with CE about how the 'personal network' entered into the different estimation techniques.  Or perhaps it was how model-based and design-based RDS estimators ‘use’ social network data differently.  The main point – I think – was a subtle methodological one but gave some insight into sensitivity to priors/ parameters.

 

5) There is something about ‘treacherous’ Bayesain posterior distributions(??)

 

Does any of this ring a bell?  Sorry again for being such a bad co-author on this, Caroline.  I *am* excited to finish it and I *am* (VERY) excited at the prospect of working with you on the Nuffield grant re: domestic servitude.

Would it help to have a conversation in order to put this project in ‘park’ so that we can resume easily when time permits?

 

Sorry for rambling.  I just do not want to forget abou this!

 

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I hope that you are well and had a well-earned break over the summer. I was at a conference earlier this week and Linda Hendry, one of the guest editors, told me that there is to be a special issue related on labour exploitation due to be announced by the International Journal of Operations and Production Management . This is a very good journal and the timeframe may suit us well - with an expected submission date around February 2025. Linda believes our DW research may be a good fit for what they are trying to achieve with the special issue

 

I'll keep an eye out for the formal call and send it across as soon as I see it. In the meantime, do let me know if it would help to catch up now - or perhaps once we have the call

 

Best wishes

Caroline
