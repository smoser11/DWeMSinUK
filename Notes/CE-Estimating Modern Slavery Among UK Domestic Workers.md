I'll help analyze these materials and understand the current state of the project. From reviewing the documents, here are the key elements:

# Project Overview #


- Study aims to estimate number/proportion of UK domestic workers experiencing modern slavery
- Uses Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) focusing on Latinx and Filipino domestic workers
- Combines RDS with Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) techniques

Current Status (as of Feb 2025):
- RDS analysis shows ~30-40% exploitation rate in sample
- Have draft paper in progress targeting IJOPM special issue (due Sept 2025)
- Working to integrate RDS and NSUM methodologies
- Recent breakthrough in possibly combining these approaches

Key Technical Elements:
1. Population Definition:
- Target: UK domestic workers with mobile phones
- Hidden population: Those experiencing exploitation/modern slavery

2. Measurement:
- Dichotomous indicators (NRM referral, below minimum wage)
- Continuous risk index (13 weighted categories)
- Network size estimation questions

3. Outstanding Tasks:
- Implement neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference
- Apply Feehan & Salganik (2016) equations to RDS data
- Compare RDS vs NSUM estimates
- Address "true zeros" in network data
- Calculate standard errors/confidence intervals

Population Estimates:
- EU data suggests ~980,000 domestic workers in UK (2018)
- NRM adult referrals: 44,360 (Apr 2009-Mar 2023)
- Need to resolve large difference between estimates

Next Steps:
1. Teams meeting scheduled for late Feb 2025
2. Working on submission for IJOPM special issue
3. Developing methodology section
4. Need to finalize analysis approach

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this overview?

# Next Meeting: #


Based on the documents and upcoming meeting, here are the key priorities to focus on:

1. Technical Analysis Steps
- Implement neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference
- Apply equations from Feehan & Salganik 2016 to combine RDS/NSUM approaches
- Compare corresponding survey questions between RDS and NSUM methods:
  - Q70/Q71 (document withholding)
  - Q39+Q42/Q43 (pay issues)
  - Q45+Q47+Q48/Q49 (abuse/threats)
  - Q61+Q62/Q64 (excessive hours)
  - Q78/Q79 (access to help)

2. Population Parameters
- Use ~980,000 as UK domestic worker population estimate (EU data)
- Use 44,360 as NRM adult referrals baseline
- Address treatment of "don't know" responses and zero network size claims
- Consider separate analysis for Filipino subgroup

3. Risk Index Implementation
- Clean coding for 13 risk categories with proper weightings
- NRM referral (0.35)
- Forced labor indicators (0.55 total)
- Below minimum wage (0.10)

4. Draft Development
- Update methods section with technical details
- Add results from statistical analysis once complete
- Position for IJOPM special issue deadline (Sept 2025)
- Consider addressing how multiple estimation approaches increase confidence

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?


# RDS + NSUM Comparison #


### 1. Technical Analysis Steps

Your notes say:

* Neighborhood bootstrap for RDS
    
* Feehan & Salganik weighted NSUM
    
* Match question sets (Q70/71, Q39+42/43, Q45+47+48/49, Q61+62/64, Q78+79)
    

‚úÖ This matches perfectly with the ‚Äúpreferred RDS + NSUM with weights‚Äù plan I outlined.  
üîß Adjustment: Instead of just Q36/Q80, you‚Äôve identified **additional question groupings** for NSUM matching. That means in your **Findings**, you‚Äôll have a _set_ of outcomes: pay issues, document withholding, abuse/threats, excessive hours, access to help ‚Äî plus your Q36/Q80 binary and risk index.

üëâ Suggestion:  
Focus first on **RDS + NSUM for _one or two outcomes_** (say, pay below minimum wage and document withholding). Once that pipeline works, scale to the rest. Otherwise you risk tinkering forever on all at once.

* * *

### 2. Population Parameters

Your notes say:

* 980,000 as UK DW population (EU)
    
* 44,360 as NRM referrals baseline
    
* Handle ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù + zero degree (already solved)
    
* Filipino subgroup analysis
    

‚úÖ The 980k aligns with your earlier EU/ONS bound, and you‚Äôve already solved the anomalies.  
üîß Adjustment: You don‚Äôt need to rerun _all_ sensitivity grids yet ‚Äî just fix on 980k as your working ‚Äúpreferred N.‚Äù Add sensitivity later for robustness.

* * *

### 3. Risk Index Implementation

Weights:

* NRM referral (0.35)
    
* Forced labor indicators (0.55 total)
    
* Below minimum wage (0.10)
    

‚úÖ This gives you a **concrete recipe** for the continuous risk index, not just a conceptual framing.  
üëâ Suggestion: Build and save the risk index _now_, but don‚Äôt overanalyze it until you‚Äôve got binary outcomes reported. The risk index can headline your **Discussion** as the novel framing.

* * *

### 4. Draft Development

Your notes:

* Methods updates
    
* Add results once done
    
* Position for IJOPM SI
    
* Stress complementarity of RDS & NSUM
    

‚úÖ That‚Äôs the same publication strategy we‚Äôve been tracking.  
üëâ Suggestion: Don‚Äôt touch the **Methods draft** until you have one RDS + one NSUM table/plot to paste in. The technical write-up will flow more naturally when you can reference actual numbers.

* * *

### üö¶ Practical Recommendation

Given this, here‚Äôs the **laser-focused order** I‚Äôd suggest for you now:

1. **Pick one outcome** (say, ‚Äúpay below minimum wage‚Äù).
    
2. Run **preferred RDS SS estimate** (with N=980k, bootstrap CI).
    
3. Run **weighted NSUM** for same outcome (eq. 7 with SS weights, v=1,0.7,0.5).
    
4. Produce one **table + forest plot** in Quarto.
    
5. Insert stub commentary beneath.
    

Once this is running smoothly, extend to the other grouped questions, then to risk index, then to Filipino subgroup. This way you‚Äôll have **something publishable in days, not months.**
