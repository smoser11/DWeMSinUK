I'll help analyze these materials and understand the current state of the project. From reviewing the documents, here are the key elements:

# Project Overview #


- Study aims to estimate number/proportion of UK domestic workers experiencing modern slavery
- Uses Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) focusing on Latinx and Filipino domestic workers
- Combines RDS with Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) techniques

Current Status (as of Feb 2025):
- RDS analysis shows ~30-40% exploitation rate in sample
- Have draft paper in progress targeting IJOPM special issue (due Sept 2025)
- Working to integrate RDS and NSUM methodologies
- Recent breakthrough in possibly combining these approaches

Key Technical Elements:
1. Population Definition:
- Target: UK domestic workers with mobile phones
- Hidden population: Those experiencing exploitation/modern slavery

2. Measurement:
- Dichotomous indicators (NRM referral, below minimum wage)
- Continuous risk index (13 weighted categories)
- Network size estimation questions

3. Outstanding Tasks:
- Implement neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference
- Apply Feehan & Salganik (2016) equations to RDS data
- Compare RDS vs NSUM estimates
- Address "true zeros" in network data
- Calculate standard errors/confidence intervals

Population Estimates:
- EU data suggests ~980,000 domestic workers in UK (2018)
- NRM adult referrals: 44,360 (Apr 2009-Mar 2023)
- Need to resolve large difference between estimates

Next Steps:
1. Teams meeting scheduled for late Feb 2025
2. Working on submission for IJOPM special issue
3. Developing methodology section
4. Need to finalize analysis approach

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this overview?

# Next Meeting: #


Based on the documents and upcoming meeting, here are the key priorities to focus on:

1. Technical Analysis Steps
- Implement neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference
- Apply equations from Feehan & Salganik 2016 to combine RDS/NSUM approaches
- Compare corresponding survey questions between RDS and NSUM methods:
  - Q70/Q71 (document withholding)
  - Q39+Q42/Q43 (pay issues)
  - Q45+Q47+Q48/Q49 (abuse/threats)
  - Q61+Q62/Q64 (excessive hours)
  - Q78/Q79 (access to help)

2. Population Parameters
- Use ~980,000 as UK domestic worker population estimate (EU data)
- Use 44,360 as NRM adult referrals baseline
- Address treatment of "don't know" responses and zero network size claims
- Consider separate analysis for Filipino subgroup

3. Risk Index Implementation
- Clean coding for 13 risk categories with proper weightings
- NRM referral (0.35)
- Forced labor indicators (0.55 total)
- Below minimum wage (0.10)

4. Draft Development
- Update methods section with technical details
- Add results from statistical analysis once complete
- Position for IJOPM special issue deadline (Sept 2025)
- Consider addressing how multiple estimation approaches increase confidence

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?
