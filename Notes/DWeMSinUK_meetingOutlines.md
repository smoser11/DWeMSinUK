Meeting Date: September 14, 2023
Speakers: SJM (Scott), CE (Caroline), SY (Selim)

Agenda:
- Discuss utilizing bootstrapping techniques for calculating uncertainty estimates around exploitation estimates
- Clarify understanding of structure of network data from survey (node1, node2 representations)
- Explain methodology behind network bootstrap techniques
- Consider timeline for progress given teaching constraints, division of labor

Key Decisions:
- Use neighborhood bootstrap method rather than tree bootstrap method
- Automate Steps 1-5: Equations from GNSUM protocol to calculate exploitation estimate including known populations (Step 4), averages (Step 5)
- Explore creating a risk index variable based on a composite of survey questions related to exploitation


Action Items:
- SJM: Consider incorporating second known population group (number of Filipino domestic workers) for subset estimates
- SY: Send adjacency matrix file showing referral network and automate Steps 1-5 GNSUM calculations
- CE: Select survey questions to include in proposed risk index

Discussion Points:
- Details of network bootstrap methodology and necessary data structure
- Limitations around sample representativeness
- Suggest comparing estimates from neighborhood bootstrap method to estimates from scale-up method as a sanity check

Attachments:
- Sample adjacency matrix data file (contents not included)

Next Steps:
- Automate Steps 1-5 GNSUM calculations to generate exploitation estimate
- Implement network bootstrap methodology
- Push progress on methods before teaching starts again in October

Meeting Date: October 20, 2023
Speakers: SY (Selim), CE (Caroline), SJM (Scott)

Agenda:
- Address SY’s questions regarding GNSUM calculations and output interpretations
- Discuss process for using bootstrap to obtain variance estimates and confidence intervals

Key Decisions:
- Use scale-up method with known population sizes of domestic workers for denominator
- Create automations for Steps 1-5 GNSUM calculations for overall sample and Filipino subset

Action Items:
- SY: Automate Steps 1-5 GNSUM calculations
- SJM: Work on implementing network bootstrap

Discussion Points:
- Interpretation of output from GNSUM calculations
- Use of overseas domestic worker population and National Referral Mechanism statistics as known population sizes
- Overview of bootstrap methodology to obtain uncertainty estimates

Attachments:
- None

Next Steps:
- Automate Steps 1-5 GNSUM calculations
- Implement network bootstrap methodology
- Reconvene meeting in mid-December 2023 to reassess progress

Meeting Date: November 10, 2023
Speakers: CE (Caroline), Speaker 1 (potentially SY), Speaker 3 (unidentified)

Agenda:
- Discuss current status and next steps for research project
- Provide update based on CE’s summary email
- Discuss use of literature papers (Nook, Guile) in review
- Clarify questions around risk assessment variables

Key Decisions:
- Include both Nook papers in literature review
- Base risk assessment groupings on composite measures from survey questions and sub-indicators

Action Items:
- None discussed

Discussion Points:
- All survey respondents indicated some exploitation based on risk assessment variables
- Interest and questions on how risk assessment variables were coded

Attachments:
- Summary email from CE (contents not included)

Next Steps:
- Finalize coding of risk assessment variables
- Share latest risk coding with team to review

Meeting Date: December 8, 2023
Speakers: CE (Caroline), SY (Selim), SJM (Scott)

Agenda:
- Discuss research progress and next steps
- Consider timeframes and objectives

Key Decisions:
- Continue working to estimate size of hidden domestic worker population experiencing modern slavery in UK using generalized network scale-up methods
- Fully utilize SY’s time through the end of December

Action Items:
- SY to contribute to background research and writing
- CE to consolidate meeting notes into draft paper

Discussion Points:
- Research has potential for policy impact given upcoming government review
- Discussed limitations around non-random sample
- Suggest comparing estimates across methods as a sanity check

Attachments:
- None discussed

Next Steps:
- Continue with calculations using existing data
- Draft initial paper consolidating methods and findings thus far
- Reconvene meeting in January 2024 to reassess progress

Please let me know if the added details and specifics help provide clarification or if you have any other suggestions for improvement. Thank you again for your guidance - it is very helpful for strengthening my analytical skills.
