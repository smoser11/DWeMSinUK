**You:**

Thank you.  I want to know about How Design-Based and Model-Based RDS Estimators Treat Social Networks
My query asks how two types of RDS estimators, design-based and model-based, handle individual social networks differently and whether they differ in sensitivity to priors and hyperparameters. 

Design-Based Estimators
Design-based RDS estimators, like the SSPS method from Guile et al., explicitly consider the structure of the RDS sample to make inferences about the hidden population. These methods leverage the order in which participants entered the study to account for the non-random nature of RDS. For instance, the SSPS estimator utilizes the wave at which an individual is recruited as a proxy for their network size. The underlying assumption is that individuals with larger networks are more likely to be recruited in earlier waves [1-4]. This information is then used to weight the sample and adjust for biases inherent in RDS.



Model-Based Estimators
In contrast to design-based approaches, model-based RDS estimators use statistical models to represent the relationships within the data. One example mentioned is replacing a binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution in the context of analyzing risk [7]. This suggests that model-based methods might incorporate individual social network data more directly by using it to parameterize the chosen model.

For instance, a model-based approach could incorporate the number of domestic workers each respondent knows (as reported in the survey) as a variable in the model. By fitting the model to the observed data, the estimator could potentially learn about the distribution of network sizes within the hidden population.

However, the sources offer limited details on the specific implementation and sensitivity of such model-based approaches for this study.

Sensitivity to Priors and Hyperparameters
I also asked about the sensitivity to priors and hyperparameters for each estimator type.

Design-based estimators, as described in the sources, might be less sensitive to priors since they rely more heavily on the observed sampling structure. The weighting schemes used in these estimators primarily depend on the order of recruitment and potentially other design features of the RDS.
Model-based estimators, on the other hand, could be more sensitive to priors and hyperparameters, depending on the complexity of the chosen model. For example, a Bayesian hierarchical model, as mentioned in source 23, could be used to model the risk of modern slavery. Such a model would require specifying prior distributions for the model parameters, and the choice of these priors could affect the final estimates. Similarly, hyperparameters controlling the model's complexity could also influence the results.
It is important to note that the specific sensitivity to priors and hyperparameters would depend on the specific design-based and model-based estimators used, as well as the specific context of the study. The sources do not provide sufficient detail to definitively assess the relative sensitivity of these methods in this case.

**ChatGPT:**

Your question about how design-based and model-based RDS estimators treat social networks, and their sensitivity to priors and hyperparameters, aligns with several research findings.

### **Design-Based vs. Model-Based RDS Estimators**

1. **Design-Based Estimators**
    
    * These estimators rely on the structure of the RDS sample to infer characteristics of the hidden population.
        
    * A key feature is their reliance on recruitment patterns, using recruitment waves and network size estimates to correct biases.
        
    * Design-based approaches, such as those discussed in [(Lange, 2014)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-comparison-of-estimators-for-respondentdriven-sampling-lange/0d420fd8c4f453529aca5caf84d41ce2/?utm_source=chatgpt), assume that recruitment is proportional to network size and attempt to adjust for biases in reported degree (network connections).
        
    * They are often evaluated through simulation to assess sensitivity to assumptions about social network structure.
        
2. **Model-Based Estimators**
    
    * Instead of relying solely on the design structure, model-based estimators explicitly incorporate statistical models to correct for biases.
        
    * One advantage is that they allow adjustments for recruitment biases using additional assumptions about network behavior [(Shi et al., 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/modelbased-and-designbased-inference-reducing-bias-due-to-shi-cameron/37dd44b9d6045902a94091798b39c944/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        
    * They are particularly useful when violations of RDS assumptions (such as differential recruitment effectiveness) cause bias.
        
    * Some model-based approaches use counting processes to track recruitment over time, improving bias reduction strategies [(Berchenko et al., 2013)](https://consensus.app/papers/modeling-and-analysing-respondent-driven-sampling-as-a-berchenko-rosenblatt/a6d04d60e6465b2aacf9821056fecb91/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        

### **Sensitivity to Priors and Hyperparameters**

1. **Design-Based Estimators**
    
    * Generally, these estimators are less sensitive to priors and hyperparameters because they primarily rely on observed recruitment structures.
        
    * However, biases can arise if degree estimates are inaccurate, leading to increased variance [(Lange, 2014)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-comparison-of-estimators-for-respondentdriven-sampling-lange/0d420fd8c4f453529aca5caf84d41ce2/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        
2. **Model-Based Estimators**
    
    * These methods can be highly sensitive to priors and hyperparameters, particularly when Bayesian models are used.
        
    * The choice of prior distributions for network parameters can influence final estimates, especially in hierarchical models [(Shi et al., 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/modelbased-and-designbased-inference-reducing-bias-due-to-shi-cameron/37dd44b9d6045902a94091798b39c944/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        
    * Some studies highlight the need for model selection procedures to mitigate mis-specification issues, as overly complex models can overfit data [(Dorfman, 1993)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-comparison-of-designbased-and-modelbased-estimators-of-dorfman/42554fd69a09558097be58a18028f156/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        

### **Conclusion**

* **Design-based estimators** leverage sampling structure and are more robust to model mis-specification but can suffer from biases if assumptions about recruitment and network size are incorrect.
    
* **Model-based estimators** allow for more flexibility and better bias correction but are more sensitive to model assumptions, priors, and hyperparameters.

Tell me more about model-assisted estimators, esp. of Gile, and Gile et al.

**ChatGPT:**

Model-assisted estimators, particularly those developed by Krista Gile and colleagues, aim to improve inference from respondent-driven sampling (RDS) by blending features of both design-based and model-based approaches. They use working statistical models to reduce bias while preserving design-based properties like consistency under the sampling design. Here's what the literature reveals:

### **What Are Model-Assisted RDS Estimators?**

* Model-assisted estimators use auxiliary information (e.g., network degree) and a working model to adjust for the non-random nature of RDS recruitment.
    
* They are designed to remain approximately unbiased even if the model is misspecified, making them robust in practice.
    

### **Key Contributions from Gile and Collaborators**

1. **Successive Sampling Estimator (RDS-SS)**
    
    * Developed by Krista Gile, the RDS-SS estimator addresses the unrealistic assumption in traditional RDS that sampling is with replacement. Instead, it models the sampling process as _successive without replacement_, which better fits real-world RDS designs.
        
    * The estimator assumes knowledge (or an estimate) of the population size and adjusts weights accordingly to reduce bias.
        
    * It performs especially well in smaller populations or when the sample is a substantial fraction of the total population [(Wang et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/assessing-consistency-of-respondentdriven-sampling-wang-wogayehu/7a2c82b060ab581a8351b162069e4f78/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        
2. **Performance in Practice**
    
    * Comparative studies show that Gile’s SS estimator and RDS-II (Volz-Heckathorn) yield more consistent estimates over time compared to RDS-I and the HCG estimator.
        
    * Gile’s methods are less sensitive to errors in assumptions like random mixing or perfect reporting of degree [(Wirtz et al., 2016)](https://consensus.app/papers/comparison-of-respondent-driven-sampling-estimators-to-wirtz-mehta/0a8564ddaba753a989e99b1fec2a2b95/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        
3. **Simulation Studies and Tools**
    
    * Gile and Handcock developed simulation tools in the `statnet` R package to evaluate estimator performance under various assumptions, such as imperfect recall of network degree [(Lange, 2014)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-comparison-of-estimators-for-respondentdriven-sampling-lange/0d420fd8c4f453529aca5caf84d41ce2/?utm_source=chatgpt).
        

### **Advantages of Model-Assisted Estimators**

* **Bias reduction**: Especially in the presence of large sample fractions or differential recruitment.
    
* **Robustness**: Maintains design-consistency even if the model is misspecified.
    
* **Improved diagnostics**: Can incorporate features like recruitment depth and homophily diagnostics to improve reliability.
    

### **Limitations**

* **Dependence on population size estimates**: RDS-SS requires some estimate of the hidden population size, which is often hard to obtain.
    
* **Computational intensity**: Model-assisted methods can be more complex to implement and interpret.
    

### **Conclusion**

Model-assisted estimators, particularly those by Gile, strike a balance between realism and statistical rigor. They correct for known biases in RDS and offer practical improvements over traditional estimators, especially in studies with large sample fractions or network effects.
