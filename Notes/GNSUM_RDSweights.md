I have an RDS sample, but I want to perform NSUM estimation.  Attached is a paper that might be helpful.  I had thought there was an equation stating how to incorporate RDS sample weights into an NSUM estimation.  Am I mistaken?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question! üß† Let‚Äôs walk through this carefully.

* * *

### ‚úÖ Short Answer:

**You are _not_ mistaken.** Feehan and Salganik (2016) do discuss how to incorporate complex sampling designs‚Äîincluding **RDS samples**‚Äîinto **NSUM** estimation. Specifically, they describe how **RDS-derived sample weights** can be incorporated into the generalized network scale-up method (**GNSUM**) when using **relative probability sampling**, which includes RDS.

* * *

### üìå Key Takeaways from the Paper:

**1. The Generalized Scale-Up Estimator (GNSUM)**  
They derive a form of the estimator:

$$\hat{N}_H = \frac{\hat{y}_{F,H}}{\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}}$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}_{F,H}$ = estimated total out-reports from frame population (usually a standard probability sample)
    
* $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$ = average _in-reports_ from hidden population members (requires a sample of the hidden pop)
    

**2. Incorporating RDS Samples into NSUM**

In Section **2.1: Estimating $\bar{v}_{H,F}$ from Sampled Data**, they explicitly describe that:

> "...estimating $\bar{v}_{H,F}$ requires only a **relative probability sample** in which hidden population members have a nonzero probability of inclusion and **respondents‚Äô probabilities of inclusion are known up to a constant of proportionality**..."

This describes **RDS samples** perfectly. üìä

**3. Weighted Estimator**  
They then provide the estimator:

$$\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F} = \frac{N_F}{N_A} \cdot \frac{\sum_{i \in s_H} \sum_j \tilde{v}_{i,A_j} / c \pi_i}{\sum_{i \in s_H} 1 / c \pi_i}$$

Where:

* $\tilde{v}_{i,A_j}$ is the respondent's report of their visibility to group $A_j$
    
* $c\pi_i$ are the **relative inclusion probabilities** (as given by e.g., RDS-II weights)
    

So: **RDS weights ($\pi_i$) can be directly incorporated into the estimation.**

* * *

### üß© Important Notes:

* They require you to **know or estimate** each participant‚Äôs **degree**, and that sampling probabilities are **proportional to degree** (as in Volz-Heckathorn RDS estimator).
    
* Assumptions like **accurate reporting of visibility**, and **representative probe alters**, still apply.
    

* * *

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveat:

They **don‚Äôt provide a one-line formula** for using RDS weights in basic NSUM (like Killworth‚Äôs estimator). Instead, they show how **the generalized NSUM estimator** can incorporate RDS weights via **Horvitz-Thompson-type weighting**.

* * *

### üìö Summary:

You _can_ incorporate RDS-derived weights into NSUM estimates using the **generalized scale-up method**. Feehan and Salganik (2016) outline how to do this with relative probability samples such as those produced by RDS. The estimator is consistent under reasonable assumptions, provided you collect the right data (enriched ARD from hidden population).

* * *

* üî¢ A worked example in R using RDS weights and NSUM?
    
* üìù A summary of assumptions you‚Äôd need to meet?

**ChatGPT:**

Fantastic ‚Äî you‚Äôve provided **all the key ingredients** for implementing a **generalized NSUM** with an RDS sample. Let‚Äôs walk through the **complete estimation process step by step**, applying the method proposed by **Feehan & Salganik (2016)** and incorporating your **RDS weights**, **known network size**, and **comparable indicators**.

* * *

üßÆ Full NSUM Estimation Workflow (with RDS Sample)
--------------------------------------------------

* * *

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Confirm Required Data is Available**

You've already prepared the following data elements:

| **Element** | **Variable** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unique ID | `id` | ‚úÖ |
| Recruiter ID | `recruiter.id` | ‚úÖ |
| Known network size (degree) | `known_network_size` from Q13 | ‚úÖ |
| Indicators of hidden population membership (respondent-level) | e.g., `document_withholding_rds`, `pay_issues_rds`, etc. | ‚úÖ |
| Indicators of knowing others in hidden population (alter-level ARD) | e.g., `document_withholding_nsum`, `pay_issues_nsum`, etc. | ‚úÖ |
| RDS weights (e.g., Volz-Heckathorn or RDS-I) | `wt.vh_*`, `wt.RDS1_*` | ‚úÖ |

All ingredients are in place üéâ

* * *

### üìè **Step 2: Understand the NSUM Estimator**

The **generalized NSUM estimator** has two main components:

$$\hat{N}_H = \frac{\hat{y}_{F,H}}{\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}}$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}_{F,H}$: **Out-reports** ‚Äî how many people the frame population (your RDS sample) reports **knowing** in the hidden population
    
* $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$: **Average visibility** ‚Äî how many **times a hidden population member** would be mentioned by someone in the frame
    

* * *

### üî¢ **Step 3: Calculate Out-Reports ( $\hat{y}_{F,H}$ )**

This is the **sum of known others** in the hidden population from your survey (e.g., Q71, Q43, etc.). You‚Äôve already created indicators like `document_withholding_nsum`, which are binary (1 = knows someone exploited, 0 = does not).

#### Options:

* **If using binary indicators (as in your code):**
    

You can sum the weighted out-reports like so:

```r
# Example for document withholding
y_FH_doc <- sum(dd$document_withholding_nsum * dd$wt.vh_980k, na.rm = TRUE)
```

This gives $\hat{y}_{F,H}$, the total number of people your sample knows in the hidden population (for a given definition of exploitation).

Repeat for each exploitation type (e.g., `pay_issues_nsum`, `threats_abuse_nsum`, etc.).

* * *

### üëÄ **Step 4: Estimate Average Visibility ( $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$ )**

Here‚Äôs where **RDS weights** come into play.

$$\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F} = \frac{N_F}{N_A} \cdot \frac{\sum_{i \in s_H} \sum_j \tilde{v}_{i,A_j} / c\pi_i}{\sum_{i \in s_H} 1 / c\pi_i}$$

Where:

* $s_H$: the sample of people **in the hidden population**
    
* $\tilde{v}_{i,A_j}$: the number of **times the respondent thinks they are known** by group $A_j$ (visibility)
    
* $c\pi_i$: sampling weights for each respondent in $s_H$
    

#### In practice:

You don‚Äôt have direct measures of visibility $\tilde{v}_{i,A_j}$, but you can **approximate** it using known **degree** (Q13) ‚Äî how many domestic workers they know ‚Äî **under the assumption of symmetry** (if I know you, you probably know me).

Assume:

\tilde{v}_{i,F} \approx \text{known_network_size}_i

So you can estimate $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$ as:

```r
# Subset to hidden population members
hidden_doc <- dd %>%
  filter(document_withholding_rds == 1 & !is.na(known_network_size))

# Weighted mean degree
v_HF_doc <- with(hidden_doc, sum(known_network_size / wt.vh_980k) / sum(1 / wt.vh_980k))
```

Repeat for each exploitation definition.

* * *

### üßÆ **Step 5: Combine into NSUM Estimate**

$$\hat{N}_H = \frac{\hat{y}_{F,H}}{\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}} \cdot N_F$$

Where:

* $N_F$: size of frame population (e.g., 980,000 for all domestic workers in the UK)
    

```r
N_F <- 980000  # or your alternative size

NSUM_est_doc <- y_FH_doc / v_HF_doc
```

This gives an estimate of how many **domestic workers in the UK** are experiencing document withholding.

* * *

### üìä **Step 6: Repeat for All Exploitation Types**

You‚Äôll generate one NSUM estimate for each:

| Indicator | NSUM Estimate |
| --- | --- |
| Document withholding | `NSUM_est_doc` |
| Pay issues | `NSUM_est_pay` |
| Threats/abuse | `NSUM_est_abuse` |
| Excessive hours | `NSUM_est_hours` |
| Access to help | `NSUM_est_help` |

* * *

### üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Combine Estimates or Use Risk Weights

Based on your `sum_categories`, `sum_categories_factor`, and the risk index (from the PDF), you could:

* Create a **weighted index of exploitation** (e.g., combining multiple indicators)
    
* Run the estimator over the combined category
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ Recap of Required R Code Steps

```r
# 1. Calculate y_FH
y_FH_doc <- sum(dd$document_withholding_nsum * dd$wt.vh_980k, na.rm = TRUE)

# 2. Estimate mean visibility (v_HF)
hidden_doc <- dd %>% filter(document_withholding_rds == 1 & !is.na(known_network_size))
v_HF_doc <- with(hidden_doc, sum(known_network_size / wt.vh_980k) / sum(1 / wt.vh_980k))

# 3. Compute NSUM estimate
NSUM_doc <- y_FH_doc / v_HF_doc
```

Would you like help with:

* üß™ Bootstrapped confidence intervals?
    
* üì¶ Packaging this into an R function for your project?
    
* üìâ Visualizations for comparing NSUM vs RDS prevalence estimates?
    

Just say the word! üòä

* * *

**You:**

Ah, I think I see.  You can use Q13 ("Do you know personally of any other domesÔøΩc workers who are
engaged in domesÔøΩc work in the UK (please answer based on the number of domesÔøΩc workers
whose contact details you have in your contacts list on your mobile phone)? If so, how many? (Please
indicate the number, or state ‚Äò0‚Äô if this does not apply to anyone you know). Numerical value.") because 'the population' is the set of of all domestic workers in the UK.  Is that correct?  Otherwise, don't we need e.g. known-group-size groups?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes ‚Äî **you‚Äôve got it exactly right**! üéØ Let me clarify this with a bit more detail so you can be confident in what you're doing:

* * *

‚úÖ Why Q13 ("How many domestic workers do you know?") can be used for NSUM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the **generalized NSUM framework**, you're estimating the size of a **hidden subpopulation** (e.g., exploited domestic workers) **within a larger frame population** (in your case: **all domestic workers in the UK**).

> So the population of reference for your NSUM estimation is:  
> **All domestic workers in the UK** ‚Äî not the general public.

* * *

### üîç NSUM Estimation Logic Recap:

$$\hat{N}_H = \frac{\hat{y}_{F,H}}{\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}} \cdot N_F$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}_{F,H}$: how many _other_ domestic workers the sample reports knowing who are in the **hidden population**
    
* $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$: how visible each _hidden_ domestic worker is to the frame population (i.e., other domestic workers)
    
* $N_F$: total number of domestic workers in the UK (your known frame population size)
    

* * *

üîÑ Why You Don't Need Known-Group-Size Alters (in This Case)
------------------------------------------------------------

In classic NSUM (Killworth, Bernard, et al.), you need **known-size alter groups** (e.g., "How many teachers do you know?") to estimate people's **degree** in the general population.

> But in your case, you're **sampling from the frame population** (domestic workers), and you ask:  
> ‚ÄúHow many **other domestic workers** do you know?‚Äù

That means:

* You‚Äôre asking about **within-frame degree** directly.
    
* You **don‚Äôt need to estimate it** indirectly using known groups.
    
* You can treat Q13 as a **direct estimate of personal network size** in the **frame population**.
    

This is exactly what Feehan & Salganik (2016) refer to when they say:

> "The key quantity we need is the number of connections to the frame population."

* * *

üìå Summary
----------

‚úÖ You _can_ use Q13 as the degree measure  
‚úÖ Your population is "domestic workers in the UK"  
‚úÖ You do _not_ need known-group-size alter questions (like ‚ÄúHow many teachers do you know?‚Äù) because your degree question (Q13) is **already specific to your frame**

* * *

üß† Optional: Caveats
--------------------

If your frame population were broader (e.g., "all adults in the UK"), then yes ‚Äî you‚Äôd likely need known-group-size questions to estimate degree.

But in your case:

* The frame population = domestic workers
    
* Degree question = ‚Äúhow many domestic workers do you know?‚Äù ‚úÖ
    
* Hidden population = exploited domestic workers
    

Everything is consistent üí°

* * *

Would you like a quick visual diagram of this logic or a tidy table showing the NSUM components in your setup? Or we can go right into code packaging if you're ready for that step.

* * *

**You:**

Excellent!  Absolutely excellent! Ultimately, I want to compare the RDS estimate to the NSUM estimate.  To do this I had to aggregate some variables so they are comparable (e.g. 

# 1. Document withholding (MOST CONFIDENT): Q70 5f2 = Q71 5f3
  # Q70: Has employer withheld travel/identity documents?
  data$zQ70 <- recode(data$q70, "4=NA")  # Set don't know to NA
  data$zQ70 <- recode(data$q70, "c(0,1,2) = 1; c(3,4)=0")  # Always/often/sometimes = 1, never = 0
  
  # Q71: Know others without access to documents? (already numeric count)

  data$pay_issues_nsum[is.na(data$q43)] <- NA

With this in mind, and given your previous answers, please can you suggest  comprehensive R: workflow to perform the NSUM estimation, using the sample from the 'hidden population.'  Then again, this approach strikes me as very odd. To wit, we are _not_ sampling from the hidden population.  We are sampling fromthe Frame.  It just so happens that some of these respondents _are_ members of the hidden population.  But we only know that ex post, e.g. after asking question q71 or q39, etc.  Doesn't that make calculating the survey weights ($\pi_i$) infeasable?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

You're asking **exactly the right questions** here! üí° This subtle point‚Äî**who is in the frame population vs. hidden population**, and how that affects weighting‚Äîis at the heart of why **NSUM with RDS samples** is both powerful _and_ tricky.

Let‚Äôs break this down carefully. First:

* * *

üß† Conceptual Clarification
---------------------------

### üìå What You Said:

> "We are _not_ sampling from the hidden population. We are sampling from the frame. It just so happens that some of these respondents _are_ members of the hidden population."

‚úÖ **Correct!** You are sampling from the **frame population** of **domestic workers** via **RDS**. This is **not** a sample of the hidden population by design ‚Äî though some of the respondents _are_ exploited workers (i.e. members of the hidden population, **ex post**).

Now here‚Äôs the key:

* * *

### üß≠ What Does Feehan & Salganik Require?

They distinguish between two estimators:

| Component | Required Sample |
| --- | --- |
| $\hat{y}_{F,H}$: Out-reports | Sample of frame population (e.g., your RDS sample) ‚úÖ |
| $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$: Average visibility | Sample of **hidden population** members with known inclusion probabilities ‚ùó |

So for **standard NSUM**, you're good.

But for **generalized NSUM**, **visibility** has to be estimated **from the hidden population**, ideally using a **relative probability sample**, _i.e., RDS of the hidden pop_.

> ‚ùó Here's the twist:  
> You are _not_ sampling the hidden population directly, but rather finding hidden population members **embedded** in your RDS sample of the frame.

* * *

üß© So Can You Estimate $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$ This Way?
------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs explore two options:

* * *

### ‚úÖ **Option A: Treat Hidden Members in RDS as a Relative-Probability Sample**

This is what **Feehan & Salganik (2016)** allow. They say (p. 827):

> "_Estimating $\bar{v}_{H,F}$ requires only a **relative probability sample** in which hidden population members have a nonzero probability of inclusion and respondents‚Äô probabilities of inclusion are known up to a constant of proportionality._"

That describes your situation:

* Your RDS sample **includes** members of the hidden population
    
* You compute **RDS-derived weights** for _all_ respondents (e.g., Volz-Heckathorn or Gile‚Äôs SS)
    
* You can apply those weights **to just the hidden respondents** to estimate $\bar{v}_{H,F}$
    

üëâ This is **valid** as long as:

* Hidden population members **have the same recruitment process** (i.e. RDS)
    
* You use **relative weights**, e.g. RDS-II weights (based on degree)
    

* * *

### üö´ **Option B: Treat Hidden Members as a Convenience Sample**

If you said: ‚ÄúNo, we didn‚Äôt sample the hidden population intentionally, and we don't know inclusion probabilities,‚Äù then **you can't estimate $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$** in a design-based way.

This would invalidate the **generalized NSUM estimator**.

But since you're using RDS with proper weights, **Option A is defensible.**

* * *

‚úÖ Recommended R Workflow for NSUM Estimation
--------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs write a full pipeline using your cleaned `dd` dataset:

* * *

### üßæ STEP 1: Define Constants

```r
# Total population size (N_F)
N_F <- 980000  # Estimated number of domestic workers in UK

# Choose your weight set (Volz-Heckathorn weights)
weight_var <- "wt.vh_980k"  # Change as needed
degree_var <- "known_network_size"
```

* * *

### üìä STEP 2: Choose an Exploitation Type (e.g. Document Withholding)

```r
# Define relevant vars
rds_var   <- "document_withholding_rds"
nsum_var  <- "document_withholding_nsum"
```

* * *

### üî¢ STEP 3: Estimate Out-Reports ($\hat{y}_{F,H}$)

```r
# Weighted sum of known others in hidden pop
dd$wts <- dd[[weight_var]]
y_FH <- sum(dd[[nsum_var]] * dd$wts, na.rm = TRUE)
```

* * *

### üëÄ STEP 4: Estimate Visibility ($\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$)

```r
# Subset to hidden pop members (those exploited)
dd_hidden <- dd %>% filter(!!sym(rds_var) == 1 & !is.na(!!sym(degree_var)) & !is.na(wts))

# Horvitz-Thompson-style weighted average
v_HF <- with(dd_hidden, sum(!!sym(degree_var) / wts) / sum(1 / wts))
```

* * *

### üßÆ STEP 5: Compute NSUM Estimate

```r
N_hidden <- (y_FH / v_HF)  # No need to multiply by N_F again (already implicit)
```

If your visibility is per hidden respondent (and not scaled to N_F), then:

```r
N_hidden <- (y_FH / v_HF) * N_F
```

Double-check scaling by plotting intermediate outputs.

* * *

### üìä STEP 6: Compute RDS Prevalence for Comparison

```r
# Weighted mean among all RDS respondents
rds_est <- weighted.mean(dd[[rds_var]], w = dd$wts, na.rm = TRUE)

# Estimated number in total frame population
rds_count <- rds_est * N_F
```

* * *

### üìã Output Both Estimates:

```r
cat("NSUM Estimate:", round(N_hidden), "\n")
cat("RDS Estimate: ", round(rds_count), "\n")
```

* * *

üß™ Optional: Automate Over All Exploitation Types?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes! You can wrap this in a function and iterate over:

```r
exploitation_list <- list(
  "document_withholding" = list("rds" = "document_withholding_rds", "nsum" = "document_withholding_nsum"),
  "pay_issues" = list("rds" = "pay_issues_rds", "nsum" = "pay_issues_nsum"),
  ...
)
```

Want help packaging that? Just say the word.

* * *

üß† TL;DR on Your Key Concern:
-----------------------------

> **"Doesn't that make calculating the survey weights ($$\pi_i$$) infeasible?"**

‚úîÔ∏è No ‚Äî because you‚Äôre using **RDS**, and can calculate **relative inclusion probabilities** for _everyone_ in the sample  
‚úîÔ∏è You can use these **relative weights** (e.g., Volz-Heckathorn) **for the subset who are in the hidden population**

Therefore: ‚úÖ **It _is_ valid to use your embedded hidden population sample to estimate visibility**, as per Feehan & Salganik.

üß† Critique of the Previous Response
------------------------------------

While the response was solid and conceptually accurate, **there are areas where clarity and specificity could be improved** ‚Äî especially for an advanced user like yourself. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

### ‚úÖ **What Worked Well**

* **Accurate conceptual framing**: The distinction between sampling the frame vs. the hidden population was well explained.
    
* **Correct use of Feehan & Salganik (2016)**: The justification for using RDS weights for the embedded hidden population was sound.
    
* **Code scaffolding**: A reasonable step-by-step estimation process in R was provided.
    

* * *

### ‚ùå **What Needed Improvement**

| Area | Problem | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Code Specificity** | The code used placeholders (e.g., `!!sym(...)`) without explanation or simplification | Provide full, **executable** R code with **clear variable names** and explanation of each step |
| **Terminology Clarity** | The distinction between visibility and degree was made, but not explicitly tied to **Q13** numerically | Re-emphasize **why Q13 is a proxy** for visibility from the hidden population to the frame |
| **Statistical Assumptions** | Implicit assumptions (e.g. visibility symmetry, independence, and accurate reporting) were not stated | Explicitly list and briefly discuss assumptions involved in estimating $\bar{v}_{H,F}$ |
| **Estimation Interpretation** | The difference between NSUM and RDS estimates was shown, but no guidance on **interpreting discrepancies** was given | Briefly discuss how to interpret NSUM vs RDS differences (e.g., underreporting bias, social visibility) |
| **Generalization** | No function or loop was implemented to allow scalability across multiple indicators | Include reusable **R function** or loop over exploitation indicators |

### üîç Clarifying the Hidden Population Estimation Using NSUM with RDS Samples

You're absolutely right to raise the key question:

> ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we sampling from the _frame_ population, not the _hidden_ population? So how can we estimate visibility from a sample we didn‚Äôt intend to collect from the hidden population?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs walk through the logic, the assumptions, and a **complete R implementation** for **comparing NSUM and RDS estimates** of exploitation among domestic workers.

* * *

üß© 1. Conceptual Framework
--------------------------

### üì¶ Your Sampling Frame:

* You sample **domestic workers in the UK** via **RDS**
    
* That‚Äôs your **frame population** $F$
    

### üîç Your Hidden Populations (H):

* Workers who have been **exploited** (based on various criteria, e.g. document withholding, pay issues, etc.)
    
* These are **identified ex post** within your RDS sample using coded responses (e.g. `document_withholding_rds == 1`)
    

### ‚öñÔ∏è Estimating Hidden Population Size (via Generalized NSUM):

$$\hat{N}_H = \frac{\hat{y}_{F,H}}{\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}} \cdot N_F$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}_{F,H}$: total **out-reports** from the frame population ‚Äî ‚ÄúHow many exploited people do you know?‚Äù
    
* $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$: average **visibility** of each hidden population member to the frame (estimated via RDS weights)
    
* $N_F$: known size of the **frame population** (e.g. all domestic workers in the UK)
    

* * *

üìå 2. Core Assumptions (per Feehan & Salganik 2016)
---------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ You can estimate visibility $\bar{v}_{H,F}$ using **a relative probability sample** of the hidden population (i.e., an RDS sample where **you can identify hidden population members and apply RDS weights**)

‚úÖ You use **Q13** ("How many other domestic workers do you know?") as a proxy for the **visibility** of a respondent ‚Äî under the assumption of **reciprocity/symmetry**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions involved:

* Accurate reporting of out-reports (e.g., Q71)
    
* Symmetric ties (visibility ‚âà degree)
    
* Homogenous visibility within the hidden population
    
* Correct RDS weights (e.g., Volz-Heckathorn or Gile‚Äôs SS)
    
* No barrier to being named (visibility bias minimized)
    

* * *

üß™ 3. Full R Workflow ‚Äî Comparing NSUM and RDS
----------------------------------------------

Here‚Äôs a complete example for one indicator: **document withholding**.

* * *

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step in R

```r
# ----------------------------------------
# Setup: Required inputs
# ----------------------------------------

# Frame population size
N_F <- 980000  # Total UK domestic workers

# Variable definitions
rds_var   <- "document_withholding_rds"
nsum_var  <- "document_withholding_nsum"
degree_var <- "known_network_size"
weight_var <- "wt.vh_980k"  # Or wt.SS_980k or wt.RDS1...

# Safety check
stopifnot(all(c(rds_var, nsum_var, degree_var, weight_var) %in% names(dd)))
```

* * *

### üßÆ Step 1: Estimate Out-Reports $\hat{y}_{F,H}$

```r
# Out-reports: How many exploited people each respondent knows
dd$wts <- dd[[weight_var]]
dd$out_report <- dd[[nsum_var]]

y_FH <- sum(dd$out_report * dd$wts, na.rm = TRUE)
```

* * *

### üëÅÔ∏è Step 2: Estimate Visibility $\hat{\bar{v}}_{H,F}$

```r
# Filter to hidden pop members (exploited) with non-missing degree and weights
dd_hidden <- dd %>%
  filter(!!sym(rds_var) == 1, !is.na(!!sym(degree_var)), !is.na(wts))

# Estimate average visibility (degree) weighted by RDS weights
numerator   <- sum(dd_hidden[[degree_var]] / dd_hidden$wts)
denominator <- sum(1 / dd_hidden$wts)
v_HF <- numerator / denominator
```

* * *

### üìä Step 3: Compute NSUM Estimate

```r
# Generalized NSUM formula
NSUM_est <- (y_FH / v_HF)  # May or may not need to multiply by N_F

# If v_HF is per respondent and not per population, scale up
NSUM_count <- NSUM_est * N_F
```

* * *

### üéØ Step 4: Compute RDS Estimate (for comparison)

```r
# RDS prevalence estimate
rds_prev <- weighted.mean(dd[[rds_var]], w = dd$wts, na.rm = TRUE)

# Scale to population
rds_count <- rds_prev * N_F
```

* * *

### üìã Step 5: Display Results

```r
cat("Estimate for Document Withholding\n")
cat("NSUM estimate: ", round(NSUM_count), "\n")
cat("RDS estimate : ", round(rds_count), "\n")
```

* * *

üîÅ Bonus: Automate Across All Indicators
----------------------------------------

You can build this into a function:

```r
compare_nsum_rds <- function(data, rds_var, nsum_var, degree_var, weight_var, N_F) {
  data$wts <- data[[weight_var]]
  data$out_report <- data[[nsum_var]]
  
  y_FH <- sum(data$out_report * data$wts, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  data_hidden <- data %>%
    filter(!!sym(rds_var) == 1, !is.na(!!sym(degree_var)), !is.na(wts))
  
  v_HF <- with(data_hidden, sum(!!sym(degree_var) / wts) / sum(1 / wts))
  NSUM_est <- y_FH / v_HF * N_F
  rds_prev <- weighted.mean(data[[rds_var]], w = data$wts, na.rm = TRUE)
  RDS_est <- rds_prev * N_F
  
  return(tibble(
    indicator = rds_var,
    NSUM_estimate = round(NSUM_est),
    RDS_estimate = round(RDS_est)
  ))
}

# Example
compare_nsum_rds(dd, "document_withholding_rds", "document_withholding_nsum", "known_network_size", "wt.vh_980k", N_F)
```

* * *

üîç Interpreting Differences Between NSUM and RDS
------------------------------------------------

| Possible Reason | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **NSUM > RDS** | Hidden population is **more socially visible** than assumed, or respondents **overreport** knowing exploited peers |
| **RDS > NSUM** | Exploited individuals are **underreported** in social networks (visibility bias), or respondents **don't recognize** peers as being exploited |
| **Both Estimates Low** | Underreporting bias, low trust, or poor measurement |
| **Both High** | Reflects high prevalence and network awareness |

* * *

üß† Final Notes
--------------

* ‚úÖ Your situation is **valid** for estimating visibility from the hidden population embedded in your RDS sample, **as long as you apply the correct RDS weights**.
    
* ‚ùó If visibility is **not symmetric** or **not evenly distributed**, estimates may be biased ‚Äî you can correct this with **enriched ARD** if you collect it.
