I want to summarize a transcript as an organized outline.  The outline will not necessarily follow the chronological order of the text in the transcript.  Here is my initial thinking on the material I wanted to discuss, and how it might be organized:
1. Conceptualization and measurement
- What is the population from which we sample?  what is the sub-population (e.g. 'hidden' population) that we are interested in?  How are these indicated/ what variables are useful?
- What is the sample and how is it obtained?  What types of analysis are appropriate for such data?
-- Are the three 'clusters' (Philipeana/ Latinx/ UK native) important to distinguish in the analysis?
2. Analysis
- Off the shelf RDS (Gile et. al.)
2a. SS-PSE with multiple clusters?
2b. Robustness to priors and $N$?
3. Combine RDS weights with NSUM methods?
4. Presentation
- What to present and how?

The outline should be logical, organized and presented in as much detail as possible.  The goal is for the outline to help a person listening to the Audio presentation of the transcript understand my meaning and further contribute to progress of the research project.
Transcript: """
Hello. Hi, Carolyn. This is Scott, obviously. I'm really sorry for missing our Monday meeting
I've been and am in administrative duties hell Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then
I returned to marking hell. So I have done work and I wanted to try and update you and
my typing is quite poor and my spelling is even worse. So I thought one quickly would
just be to send you a recording. So here's a somewhat, I tried to organize my thoughts,
but right. Here's a suit. Here's where I'm at and what I was hoping to have discussed
with you on Monday, but again, I missed it. So I'm, I'm, I'm sorry about that. Okay.
So, bring it up. Here we go. I think the first thing for me when approaching when
re-approaching this, and I think I've got my head around, I've re got my, I've got my head
re around these things. So I start with conceptualization and population, which let me call the setting.
So the first question is what is the population? I think we have a very clear answer to that
is domestic workers in the UK, more technically it is domestic workers in the UK that have
a mobile phone during survey fielding. Maybe that have had a cert that have had a mobile
phone in the calendar year proceeding the survey fielding, something like that. Okay.
So if that's the population, which I think that we're sampling from, which I believe
it is, and I think that's very well defined and that's fantastic. I think the target population,
this hidden population, so to speak, are domestic workers in the UK that have a cell
phone that have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There's
a few ways that we can operationalize that. You and Salim, and me a little bit, but really
it was all you, I think have come up with three very principled ways to do this. The
first two are dichotomies. So this would be a question 36 dichotomized. This is the simply
do you get paid less than the legal minimum wage. And question 80 also dichotomized, which
is have you been through the national referral mechanism, or have you been referred to the
national referral? To my mind, these are both very high bars. Like if people answer yes
truthfully to either of those questions, I think, and I'm not a subject of that expertise
whatsoever, but I think we can be very confident that yes, that person counts as a member of
the hidden population. I think that's true. We also discussed and you and Salim, mainly
you developed a continuous measure. So here the idea, I think, is conceptually different.
So in this third idea, which I think is called, sorry, I took notes and clearly I can, this
is like the some categories or some cut. The idea is you developed a series of indicators,
it sounds like eight or 12 or 16. And we just sort of normalize them and said, you know,
how many of these indicators, and actually there was a waiting to them, do you satisfied,
and then we're going to come up with some number between zero and one that represents your
exposure to the risk of experiencing modern slavery. So this can, if we use that as a
measurement, as a separate measurement, as a continuous measurement of not experiencing
modern slavery, but risk of experiencing modern slavery, that might sound like I'm splitting
hairs, but I think both methodologically in terms of dichotomies versus continuous,
but more importantly, I think conceptually, those are quite different, because in the latter
case, if we're, if we claim that we're measuring risk of exposure, then, then I think the population
is to be a little bit re, well, then the hidden population definitely needs to be redefined.
So the V population that we're sampling premise still domestic workers in the UK that have
a cell phone, yada, yada, yada. But in this third continuous operationalization of experiencing
modern slavery or more formally risk, let's call it a risk index, and I've called it like
24 different things, and I'm sorry. But in that world, we're asserting that everyone in
the population has some value of this variable. That is to say, everyone in the population,
domestic workers in the UK that we're sampling from, have some risk of experiencing modern
slavery, then that risk might be zero. Okay, fine. So, but, but again, conceptually, I think
that's important. Okay. So one, don't know if that's correct or not, but that's where I'm,
that's one, that's where I started with. Okay. So then, so we've got the population, we've got
the target population. So now how are we sampling? So where is this data coming from? So this, we
sort of spent a few rounds and months on this, but I think it was productive, although perhaps not
what you wanted to hear or I wanted to hear or whatnot. But I think where we landed was, well,
look, what do we have? We have a convenient sample. We have an RDS sample, a respondent-driven
survey in which the respondents are members of the population. We're sampling from domestic workers
in the UK that have a cell phone, right? Yada, yada, yada. We're sampling from that population.
Initially, there are seeds and then we're doing an RDS with five coupons to,
to, to branch out, to do the, the RDS or the, the, the modified snowballs, not exactly snowballs,
whatever. Okay. Again, these are my beliefs. So please, right, correct me if, if, if, if I'm
wrong. Okay. So that's the data that we have to work with. So now the question is, what do we
do with that data? I want to add one additional aspect to the, the data, the, the sample I should
say, let me separate that from the data we're talking about in a second. In, in that functionally,
the sample, again, none of this is criticism whatsoever, but functionally, the sample comes from
three groups or we're sampling from three subgroups within the population of domestic
workers in the UK that have a cell phone. Those are people from the Philippines, maybe they're here
on a visa, maybe they just identify as Philippine, no, Filipina. Latinx, again, by self-identified
origin, ethnicity, I don't remember the exact wording and other, and, and British born. And
that one, British born, I think pretty sure is a, is a, is actually asked. I don't have the question
number on, on me. So if we wanted to, we could say, okay, well, look, there's really within this
here sample, there's three distinct clusters by say, nationality. I think we, I think we could
assert that with veracity. It's been a long few days and it's only Tuesday. I'm sorry. Okay. So
that these natural three subgroups or clusters, Latinx, Filipino a and, and British born, I think.
Okay. All right. So that's the sample. So then let me, we've got, I hope you're drinking a lot of tea
or coffee and pausing and or deleting this video. Okay. So then before I get to analysis, I want to do
a few data issues. So, so one, do we know anything about these sizes? So do we know anything about
estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK? So I found two websites once
one's official UK is nationalcareers.service.gov.uk job groups. So they sort of,
I'm guessing it's census based, but they're, they're these job groupings. And another is from
some organization in the UK called BICS. I've already forgotten what that stands for. But
it looks like there's some maybe a sense of the number of domestic workers in the UK. It depends
on how you count like these, you know, is this home cleaning? Is it daycare? Is it institutionalized?
Is it not? And like I said, this is just a very preliminary thing. Okay. So that's one numbers.
One A numbers. Well, actually, we could estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from
your very clever sample because of the RDS nature. So one of the questions in the survey is how many
other domestic workers do you know in the UK? And then ask for some, some recruitment information.
But just asking the how many. So basically what I'm saying is we're sampling from the population
of domestic workers in the UK. And one of the questions is how many other people in this
population do you know? So we can use that information to estimate the size of the population
where the population means domestic workers in the UK. Okay. So that's another that's I'm exploring
that currently as a possible additional source of information. By the way, that is using older,
I'm just saying this for the record. Sorry. So that's using sort of the the
uh, guile at all, but the early stuff. So 2010, 2011, uh, stuff that the stuff we'll talk about
in a second. The for analysis is a bit later 2014, 2015, a bit later. Okay. So what I'm saying is
the population, we can try and estimate the size of the number of domestic workers in the UK,
which might be of interest for a number of reasons. For me is of interest because we need that number
for later calculations and that can come from a few sources. I found two online, maybe they're
valid, maybe they're not. The third is we could try and estimate that from your survey. I'm working
on that currently, but it's giving weird answers. Like it's way too small and it's taking way too
long to run. So whatever, I'm just saying that for the record. Okay. Now I don't remember what number
we're up to. Analysis. Uh, so step one, let's just take it from the literature. Let's do the
guile at all. So this is the so-called SSPS. So this is the successive sampling population size
estimates. And uh, Krista Guile, who again, small world, we were neighbors at it in our postdoc at
doctor comes up with this very clever way of exploiting additional information within RDS
samples that essentially takes into account. What's really cool about it is that it uses
when, at which wave did you appear in the sample as an additional piece of information?
And the idea being that those with larger personal networks, so if I'm a seed and I give two recruits,
odds are those two recruits have bigger social networks than say the other people
that I didn't recruit. Basically, that's the idea and, and so on and so forth. Okay. So it uses this
idea, which overcomes it. It mitigates a lot of biases that were in so-called RDA1 and RDA2,
sorry, RDS1 and RDS2. I've also seen it called RDSA and RDSB volts, etc, etc, etc. So this SSPSC
seems to be, as far as I can tell, pretty, pretty state of the art. Okay. So we can just take that
from the literature. We can do estimation. There's a few hiccups, but nothing that we can't overcome.
And we get proportions. We get proportions of the population, which currently we don't know the
size of, but we can come up with some sensible ways of estimating it that are experiencing,
that are in the hidden population, that are experiencing modern slavery, however defined,
via Q36 or Q80, both dichotomized, which again, to my mind, are very sort of high bars. Like,
if you're saying yes to either Q36 or Q80, again, dichotomized, like, there's very good,
if you're answering honestly, there's very, very good reasons to think that
you're a member of the hidden population, that you're a domestic worker in the UK with a cell
phone, mobile phone, sorry, American, that is being exploited, that is, that is experiencing
modern slavery. Okay. So we can do that. And then there's, there's some sort of very, very recent,
most recent I found was the McLaughlin at all, 2023. I don't even know if I've sent it around.
Sorry if I haven't. That says, yeah, yeah, that's great. But essentially, the number of people that
I report, it's really clever. It says basically, the number, I might not know the number of people
that I know. And so the number of people that I report shouldn't be taken too literally. Essentially,
you should be taken, sort of what they do is they just add a measurement error components. They say,
yeah, well, you might not actually know, you might not truthfully report the number of people that
you know that, that are in your personal network, that are in our world, that are domestic workers
in the UK that have such and such characteristics. Okay, so we can do all that. And I have done,
done that. And, and the answer is really high proportions, something like 30 to 40%.
Depending on a few, you know, which question we use, priors, which model, etc, etc. But
pretty consistently 30 to 40%. Sorry, let me say differently.
And concurrent with the preliminary stuff I sent, whatever it was, months ago,
something like 30, 40% of domestic workers in the UK, if that's the population,
we are estimating to be experiencing modern slavery again, depending on how we're defining it.
It's one of these two dichotomous, dichotomous variables. And, and again, you know, those
caveats, however, I will say this, I was worried about a few things. Because when I first saw that,
I thought, wow, that's really high. I thought. So maybe there's some convergence issues,
doesn't look like it looks like the things have converged pretty well.

This is embarrassing, I got, this reminds me that when I was younger, my parents would
call me the voicemail and sometimes my dad especially would just ramble and the voicemail
would cut off, he would have expired the maximal amount.
I think that just happened to me, I've been rambling at you for more than the allotted
time that Microsoft is letting me and yet here I go again.
So I'll do my best to try and send along some kind of summary transcript.
I'm sorry, this is me trying desperately to stay current and catch up on research of which
this is literally the number one priority and you see it that I'm already falling behind.
So I'm really sorry about that.
Okay, right, blah, blah, blah.
Where were we?
So there are these estimates and they seem, I believe them more than I did when I first
sent the preliminaries around.
Now there's still stuff to do, there's still robustness, this, that and the other, but these
numbers seem pretty high.
Okay, again, 30 to 40%, something like that.
Now there's a few caveats here, well I need to say caveats, there's a few things I need
to say.
The first is, I should have said earlier, isn't about the analysis, it's about the data
and data cleaning, so one thing and much appreciation to Salim, he's done a ton of work, but one
is, and this turns out to be a bit of a subtle issue at least in political science, so one
is how do you deal with the don't knows?
So some of the questions, for example, one of the questions, one of our indicator questions
about are you in this hidden population, how are you experiencing modern slavery, is
about referral to the national referral mechanism.
And one of the response answers is, for I don't know.
So the issue is, how do you deal with those?
And those I don't know sort of pop up and obviously in lots of other questions.
Currently in Salim's formulation, they're being coded as in the negative, no I'm not
whatever the question is asking, something just happened, oh my god, I feel like I'm
like one of the worst colleagues, I'm so sorry.
So an alternative approach is to classify them as missing, so essentially you say, well
look, if a person reports, I don't know if I've been referred to the national referral
mechanism, we're just going to ignore you for purposes of analysis.
We're not going to count you as no I haven't been referred.
So doing that actually weirdly increases very slightly the estimates of domestic workers
in the UK experiencing modern slavery.
So Salim's descriptive statistics were, if you do what I'm suggesting, which is to
treat the don't knows differently from either an affirmative or a negative, you get ever
so slightly higher descriptive statistics, higher proportions just raw from the sample
data.
And it's something, you know, it's like 42 to 44, 42 to 43 or something like this, I
mean it's not, they're not huge.
That's one issue too, this one's a bit trickier, 17 out of 97 people in the sample report knowing
zero domestic workers in the UK.
So that one of the questions that, in fact the question, I should be more clear, I'm
sorry Caroline, I'll try and clean up in the transcript, in the summary of the transcript,
say I know zero people in the population, which we've defined to be, if I'm thinking
about this correctly, domestic workers in the UK.
Right.
Okay.
Okay, so maybe they do, maybe that's true or maybe they don't, but then in terms of
this data cleaning business, but then some of them make referrals.
So among the 17 that say I know zero domestic workers in the UK, there's another question
that says, please give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK that you know,
where no is defined properly per your survey, and they'll give a cell phone number or two.
Which again, this is like a logical inconsistency, if you report a referral, and a referral
must be a domestic worker in the UK, then you cannot know zero domestic workers in the
UK.
So there's a few people in the survey like that.
So those zero, essentially what I'm saying is those zeros should actually be something
positive.
We don't actually know, but a conservative answer would be turn those zeros into ones.
So I haven't done that, but it's a handful of people.
I can't imagine it's going to matter, but there's a larger issue which is what to do
with these zeros.
So if you claim that you know zero, if a person in the sample claims they know zero domestic
workers in the UK, and like I said, there's 17 or so out of 97, so it's not nothing.
What do we do with those?
And the reason I say that is because the estimators that I've been using essentially
can't handle the zeros.
And the reason for that I hadn't thought very deeply about, but I guess kind of makes sense
in the following way.
The estimators that we're dealing with just extensively rely on social network information.
And so if there's a person in your sample that says essentially I have, I don't have
a social network, zero, then that causes some problems because the entire estimation
strategy of these different techniques are to exploit, are to use whatever social network
there is.
But if that's zero, then something breaks.
And to be honest, I haven't worked through the math.
So what do we do with those?
We could remove them.
Turns out that doesn't really matter too much.
We could try other techniques.
I haven't fully explored that.
I've explored that a little, and I don't really know what to make of it.
Or we could just really add hawk, like just add one to everybody's reported degree.
So all the zeros turn into ones, all the fives turn into sixes.
That's not principled whatsoever.
But it's another approach.
Okay.
So that's data stuff.
All right.
Now, with regard to results, which again, I've completely misordered this and hopefully
it will be temporarily correct in the accompanying outline should I get around to producing it.
So this 30, 40% business that I mentioned earlier, like I said, I believe it more than
I did when I sent you the initial plumber results, which were relatively similar.
The little convergence results, so we have this estimate that's doing a lot of math.
And the idea is it comes up with lots and lots and lots of estimates.
But when all these estimates get very, very close to each other, the algorithm stops and
says, okay, here it is.
And so you can look and see, you know, does it actually do that?
And the answer is yes.
It converges.
Okay.
So I'm relatively, I'm more confident in the numbers on resolve that.
Okay.
So what am I, I'm sorry, I need to look at, right.
So the number one is just, do we believe these results?
I've checked convergence preliminarily, it looks pretty good.
We could do sensitivity analysis.
That would be on me.
I've done a little bit of that.
And again, it seems, in my opinion, surprisingly robust, like, I don't remember my discussion
about frequentist versus Bayesian, but the idea is you put some prior information into
this, into this, into this estimator, like, for example, how many domestic workers are
there in the UK?
What is the size of the population?
Now, we don't know that number, but we have some belief about it.
The beliefs I've been using are something like 1.74 million, say 2 million, whatever.
So you can change that number.
And the resulting estimates are very, very similar, again, in this 30, 40% range.
There are other techniques.
So the techniques I've been using all assume that the graph is connected.
So what that means is that if we were to know everybody's social network, which we don't,
but if we were to know all of it, it's connected.
So functioning with that means is that if there's a Ecuadorian in our sample, that truly,
if we had the entire social network of all domestic workers in the UK, which we don't,
if we did, there'd be some path for that there domestic worker from Ecuador to any other
person, any other domestic worker in the UK, in particular to the Filipino worker who might
be in our sample or might not, to the British born, the British national, whatever.
So truly, they're all connected.
Now, I think I mentioned this, but there's, I think there's some reasons to think that
might not be true, that there really, there might be clusters or subgroups here, primarily
around language, I would guess, again, this isn't, I'm not a subject of expert, but that's,
so that's fine.
There are techniques to deal with that.
So we could, and I haven't, but we could pretty straightforwardly deal with, well, maybe there's
a Filipino, Filipino, a network, and maybe there's a Spanish speaking network, or maybe
there's a UK born network, and maybe those are different.
Maybe they're not, maybe they're all connected.
But we could, one might say, well, I don't really think that they're all connected.
So that's fine.
We can deal with that.
I haven't, but, but, but we can.
Okay.
So that's one thing.
So disaggregate by origin.
We got that.
Yeah.
Like I said, it's, it's, in my opinion, shockingly high.
And so, you know, there's the whole, do we believe it?
Oh, and then, right.
Okay.
So then there's a, there's, there's an entirely separate, to my mind, this is a third sort
of approach or strata estimation strategy, which is so far everything I've talked about
is sort of off the shelf RDS.
It's very sophisticated and involves tweaks, like visibility and measurement error, yada,
yada, yada, yada, yada, but it's very, our sample is RDS.
And we're trying to estimate the size of some population slash hidden population slash members
of the population with some particular categorical attribute, et cetera, which again, perfectly
fine fits the data fantastically.
It's not at all what I thought we initially started this project with, which was some
variant of in summer or network scale up in particular, you're very, very cool and very
novel idea to use the generalized GN sum here.
So the question is, can we use the data that we have to do some kind of in some ish estimation?
And the reason I'm sort of pushing this or advocating for this is because I think it's
much more.
My guess is it's going to be much more powerful because in some is using more information.
And it's not just, it's not just counting the number of, well, how do I say this?
So in some is very, very powerful.
The issue is if you don't have a random sample, what do you do about that?
And the answer is lots of weird math that essentially boils down to the linchpin for
us is what's called inclusion probabilities.
So we don't have a random sample we acknowledge that that's fine.
So how, what statistical tricks can we do to the data that we have in sample so as to
be able to justify and use techniques that are meant for analysis of random samples like
in some.
Okay, so there's an answer to that and the answer is waiting.
And I think there's some really, really nice intersections here and really pretty straightforward.
I haven't implemented them, but essentially we can use, we can derive weights from these
RDS estimators and logic and packages and R to come up with these inclusion probabilities.
And again, we can do a few robustness whatever and then throw use those in the in some calculations.
I haven't done that, but I'm really excited to do that because I think my hunch is that's
going to be much more powerful in that it's just it's sort of taking the best, it's squeezing
all the information that at least I am aware of out of the data that we that we actually
have.
Okay, I've been rambling the combined with that.
So I haven't done that.
So, so me, Scott Moser to do bootstraps, I've done some, I haven't done all of them.
Since the analysis against some, not a bunch, this, this third way, this in some plus RDS
weights, I'm very excited about, haven't touched it, I haven't touched it practically.
I have thought about it and have notes, which are a mess.
Okay, next topic presentation.
What do we want to present?
And how do we want to present it?
Cables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian plus series, what?
I don't know.
And if I'm being perfectly honest with Caroline, I don't, you know, I'm not really right now,
I'm not in a huge position to sort of produce like publication ready graphics or what have
you.
But I think that's a discussion that would help me at least.
Okay, I think I'm about to get cut off again.
So I'm going to stop.
This is what I was hoping to report, discuss, talk about with you on Monday.
And like I said, I had early failed.
Hopefully this has some meaning.

    * Continuous measure: Risk of experiencing modern slavery based on various indicators.
        

#### 3. Sampling Methodology

* **Data Source:** RDS (Respondent-Driven Sampling) sample of domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones.
    
* **Subgroups within Sample:** Clusters based on nationality (Philippines, Latinx, British born).
    

#### 4. Data Issues and Estimation

* **Population Estimates:** Using survey data to estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK.
    
* **RDS Data Utilization:** Using techniques from Gile et al. for successive sampling population size estimates.
    
* **Robustness of Analysis:** Exploring robustness to different priors and sample sizes.
    

#### 5. Analysis Strategy

* **RDS Estimation:** Discussion on the off-the-shelf RDS method and SSPS (Successive Sampling Population Size Estimates).
    
* **Disaggregating by Origin:** Potential for separate analysis of different nationality clusters.
    
* **Estimation Challenges:** Issues with zeros in the data and social network information.
    

#### 6. Integration of RDS and NSUM Methods

* **Combining Techniques:** Exploring the possibility of integrating RDS weights with NSUM (Non-Sampling Error and Unit-level Measurement Error) methods for more powerful analysis.
    

#### 7. Presentation and Discussion

* **Data Presentation:** Deciding on the format (tables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian posterior series).
    
* **Further Discussion Points:** Need for more discussion to guide presentation choices.
    

#### 8. Conclusion

* **Recap:** Summary of the discussed points and apology for any confusion caused by the message format.
