0	14240	So I guess just a quick update on my end, so I've been, things are coming along, things
14240	21440	are coming along, but it's just, I just need a lot of electrons, so I just have these big
21440	28600	runs is what's going on right now, so I have a preferred model and then I have like 50,
28920	34200	alternative models for robustness, shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all
34200	42600	the electrons, so that's sort of chugging along. I'm almost done, but haven't finished implementing
42600	54760	the Fihan and Solvnik. How can I, yeah. The insum, the insum, so I'm almost done with that.
54840	60520	They, I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to
60520	68280	re-learn it. There's, so I'm doing that and then when I do that, then we'll get an estimate and do
68280	73320	the bootstraps and that's, I think that'll be pretty neat. There's one weird thing about the data
73320	77720	that I discovered, there's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry, before I get there,
78600	87160	I did subset it by just the people who identified as Philippine O and the estimates are about the
87160	94120	same, they're slightly higher, it's something like 47%, depending on how you measure exploitation,
94120	99960	so, but they're about the same, but slightly higher and I haven't done anything else on that,
99960	108200	the data. So, there are two weird sources of errors. The one is, is these, these true zeros,
108200	114200	remember we talked about from a while ago, so people could say that they don't know any, but
114200	119560	okay, sorry, two other things, I should make notes to myself so I can pop size.
120280	125880	You want to record it, Scott? That's okay, I'm, I take furious notes. Record it somewhere, yeah.
125880	129320	But you feel, I don't object, please feel free to if you want to the
131240	138360	pop size. Oh, so you could, people have reported that they know zero domestic workers in the UK
138360	144040	with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone, so that's, we fixed that up, that's fine.
144040	149720	And then there was another one, which is really weird, which is where they, the number of people
149720	155320	they reported knowing, Q13 I'm pretty sure is the one, I know these things are stuck in my head
155320	162680	now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than the, the,
164040	172120	the number of people they recruit, where recruiting is determined by the node one,
172120	178280	node two, the network structure. So that's really weird. I don't, that one took me a while to sort
178280	184680	of, and it's two people, but those two people really, really messed me up. So, so I fixed that.
184680	190760	So, so now we have a new personal degree size, which is the max of all of those.
192440	199400	So it's, it's the max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the
199400	205560	number of people that you recruit as given by the network structure. And like I said, the last one
205560	211080	sort of a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not,
211080	214840	I'm not super worried about it. And then we have these things this thing, we have these suspicious,
215880	221080	suspicious variable. So we can, we can, what I'm trying to say is like, we can, we can remove
221080	226840	the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat. And that's, that's, that's fine. Okay.
227800	232920	So that's that implementing the FIHAN. And so that's just electricity at this point, like it's
232920	239400	just, it's, it's done. And again, the estimates are very, very, very consistent between 30 and 40
239400	247720	percent, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me, that's shockingly high, but it's,
247720	254680	it's very consistent. So in some I'm working on the bootstrap is working. And I'm almost done with
254680	263640	the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff. So we need the, the size of the frame.
264200	268760	So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year.
268840	273160	We needed that for the, the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that.
274440	281000	The preferred number, thanks to you, Caroline, 980,000, I think, something like that came from
281000	288520	Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah. And again, I've found it out. I use,
289480	300040	I use sample frame sizes from 10,000, 100,000, not in the 980,000, 1.5 million, just again,
300040	305480	for robustness. I should probably add, because I think one of the, I don't know what was called,
306040	312680	I drew it down, the, there are these two occupational classes that you used Caroline from.
313240	319720	And, and one of them was like spot on. And then the other one was sort of, was plausible. But
319720	325320	so what I'm trying to say is I should, I should use, so currently the preferred model uses the
325320	331480	sum of those two numbers. But I should, I should, wait, and that's fine. I'm happy to report that
331480	337400	and everything. But again, for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated
337400	345080	whatever. So that's, that's, that's for me to do. Now, the probalters. So we need to know this,
345080	349560	I only have one, and that's the number of people, you know, who have been referred to
350280	356760	the National Referral Mechanism, or whatever it's called, NRM. So we have that question.
357640	364840	And we, thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people in the UK, like we know the size
364920	373160	of that group. And so, I'm sorry, I'm rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two
373160	377640	population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame, which we needed from before.
377640	382200	And there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the in sum, we also need the
382200	387400	size of these probalter groups. So I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. And it
387400	393160	just sort of, just sort of adds some complexity to, it adds noise really to these estimators. So I
393240	399080	haven't done that. That's going to be more electrons, more electrons to use. So right,
399080	404200	probalter group, that was the other pop size. And I told you about the weird, this thing with the
404200	409560	people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry, I don't know how to count. And that's
409560	415240	where I'm at. So sorry, I didn't, again, sorry, I was coding furiously, hoping I could get it done
415240	421160	before three, but then I thought I didn't know how to read my calendar. So sorry about that. So,
421640	423720	so that's sort of the update on my end. Data is
423720	428280	I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress. And I
428280	432120	suppose the question is, what do you need from us? So I think, I think we're good to
433960	444360	electrons. That's fine. I think we're ready for venue discussion, where we want to submit it.
444360	450280	And Slim, were we able to, did the Zoteros references work for you? I don't know. I sent
451240	455880	it. It did. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So basically, so what I'm trying to say, I think, I think we're,
455880	461720	we're into like, once, while my batch is running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you
461720	468120	know, writing up the results, conclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like, yeah.
469240	476040	Okay, that's fantastic. So in terms of journal targets, I mean, the question is, I suppose,
476680	484120	within the business school, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list.
484120	491160	With ABS? Sorry. If I can, Association of Business School, Journal Quality List,
492920	499960	the school signs up to the Dora principles that it's not all about journal destination,
499960	505480	but it is a factor. So one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal target is
505560	511880	that list. Okay. But I tend to publish anywhere that, so I have not really been following the rules
511880	518520	very strictly. And I don't know what your publication targets might look like. And so I'm
518520	524520	quite happy to be ecumenical about this, and not necessarily pick a journal off that list,
524520	532840	just because that's what you're supposed to do. But, but having said that, there is one journal
532840	537880	potentially, which is a three star journal. So it's not an absolute top quality, but it's
537880	549240	a rectangle called Work Employment and Society, which has a strong theoretical basis. So I don't
549240	554040	know whether, well, that would mean that I would need to do some background work on,
554040	558840	they definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's sort of sociologically focused.
559800	564120	And the advantage is one of the editor-in-chiefs is actually Marek,
565080	572360	Causes Inksteed, who is, yeah, who's obviously at the business school. So I could sound him out
572920	577720	and just say, would you accept a sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated
577720	583160	paper in the domestic workers sphere? Is that something that you think might fall within this
583160	591320	scope of the journal? So that was the target that sort of occurred to me, but I'm very open to
591320	596920	publishing where it would suit you, Scott. I mean, I think the ABS list is a great place to start.
597480	603720	Because I know nothing about this, this field at all. But it sounds like, I mean,
604520	609320	yeah, more stars is better in general for me. But at the same time, like I'm not,
610040	614840	like you, Caroline, like I'm not, I'm not picky about these things. But, you know,
615960	621640	my general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down the tears as the rejection
621640	629080	ladder just come, come in, which in my case, they, they fill up my mailbox. So that would be,
629800	638120	yeah, so I mean, ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are sort of appropriate for, you know,
638120	646280	labor, domestic work, UK, human rights, whatever, and start there and yeah, work our way down would be,
646280	649880	I guess one of the things I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important
649880	661720	is, so the strategy I just articulated is, is a lengthy process. So, so I guess we should talk
661720	666120	about timeline. Are there are people going in for promotion or jobs or other, are there,
666680	670680	is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or?
670680	675960	I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know, how
675960	681800	does that sound for you? Yeah, again, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm okay taking time and doing the, the
682440	687080	start high. And when's the next, do we know when the ref cycle ends? I don't, I don't know. When is it?
687720	692840	Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's ref 2029 now. But when the actual
692840	701480	ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline for paper submissions is, I don't know, but I mean
701480	709320	24, we've got a few, we've got enough time to try a higher journal and then knock down to it. So
709320	714760	we, I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars. If you think we'd like to
714760	719400	start with that. That would be my preference, if that's it. If, if there's, yeah, that would be
719400	724280	my preference. I'd like, I'd like you, I don't, I don't have time constraints. Somewhere like the
724280	732120	British Journal of Management. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view,
732120	738280	a bit of a quantitative bias. So that might work in our favor. And I can have a bit of a
739320	744360	search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But I mean,
744440	751240	the fact that it's UK statistics might be quite appropriate for them. We just,
752360	759400	we just might need to sort of cite it in their literature to sort of see what debates they're,
759400	768520	they're talking about. So that's a bit of work for me to do. And then, yeah, see what I mean,
768520	776520	I asked our Dean and Alex to our terms about this. And he suggested research policy
777320	783880	and science. Okay. Neither of those journals I know anything about. I did look at the
785240	793640	aims and scope and to me, didn't seem to fit. But that was his initial suggestion. I don't know
793640	799480	if you know anything about science. Science is absolutely top. But yeah, it's a strange
799480	805720	fit. I wouldn't, I think of them as doing more like biology kinds of stuff. I mean,
805720	811240	basically, what they do is like really, really high profile stuff, regardless of field. And so
811240	819240	maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is high profile, maybe. But yeah,
819320	822280	it's said to be as an odd, as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you.
822280	826280	Yeah. I've heard of you. Do you know anything about research policy?
826280	832120	No, but I think policy sounds like a good, a good class of journals to maybe target.
832840	840440	Although we don't really have any policy implications currently, but, but that could,
840440	845080	that could be strengthened perhaps. Yeah, that brings to mind another journal called Millbank
845080	850760	Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're
851480	857720	A, B, B, S. That's possible from a policy point of view, but maybe British Journal of Management
857720	868360	is better. Excellent. Yeah. So, and then I suppose work, employment and society, if we fail with
868360	874680	BJM, it's like the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. Good. Excellent. Excellent.
874680	878680	That's great. That's great. That's great. That sounds all right. Sounds great for me.
880360	886520	So if I do a bit of a literature search, the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until
886520	892120	April. That's fine. And I've got seminar weeks coming up. So, and my diary is absolutely chock
892120	899960	block. So the, the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days, I think I could perhaps spend
899960	905960	some time. Actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well. So
907560	915800	I can do, make a start on that then. And then, so at least get you sort of some indication and
916760	922520	yeah, but we, I think British Journal of Management does seem to be quite a good fit. And that's,
922520	926520	that's a good journal. Excellent. If we get into that. Let's, let's start there. Let's start there.
926520	935560	I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week, because like you, the next two to
935560	940360	three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff. But I'm,
941320	946760	reading week has been good and I'm making, so I'm going to make a push to try to get, you know,
948520	954680	the results done. Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team. It's
954680	959640	really, really, really, really great. It's been fantastic working with the both of you. So thank
959640	965800	you. Yeah, so it'd be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah,
965800	973720	if we were to aim to do that for the summer, is that too, is that all right? I think by the time
973720	980440	we sort of tidied everything up. Yeah. And then, yeah. Yeah, June, I think it was a good target.
980440	984440	And July, if we get, if we miss, you know, I think that's a, I think it's very feasible as well.
984440	990680	I mean, like I said, the right sort of April, we'll, we'll be able to come back to it and polish and
990680	997320	then, you know, yeah. And I'm hoping next term might be quite as bad as this term. I'll have a
997320	1003560	little bit, it'll be just marking then. Just marking. It just never ends. It just never ends. So
1006040	1012440	but okay, this is great. I'm going to, I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll, I'll email you
1012440	1019240	with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the, I'm not expecting any
1019240	1025240	surprise. So the RDS stuff is done, done. And then the insum, I don't know. I'm not expecting to be
1025240	1032280	surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. Fantastic. Really, really good. Was there anything from you
1032280	1039240	Selene that you wanted to share with us? I have two points. First, Dr. Moser, do you have anything
1039240	1046120	that you need from my side other than the sort of references? Is there anything else? That's it.
1047080	1053080	And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We started with BigBot. You may have
1053080	1060520	seen my email that I don't want to be included in the publication for this research. What do you
1060520	1068920	think about that? I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your, to your PhD advisor, Dr.
1068920	1074360	Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need, if you want to stay in academia, you need publications.
1074360	1082120	And in the past, you've mentioned sort of wanting to fortify your quantitative
1082920	1090920	credentials. And this would certainly help with that. I mean, I think I understand his point.
1090920	1094840	If I'm not saying this point, it's something like branding, like you don't want to get labeled as
1094840	1100360	something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just, you need publications
1100360	1106120	and full stop. So, I wasn't from Dr. Randall. I have to say it's not from Dr. Randall. It's from
1106120	1113640	the mentor in the US when I spent time there, because I'm still having meetings with the professor
1113640	1120600	there. And I see he is also the Dean of the department for international relations and politics.
1120600	1129240	And recently we had another meeting and he told me it would be not good if I have a profile
1129240	1135800	that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that. And I,
1137080	1142680	and I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I don't include my name.
1142680	1147560	I mean, it's one, it's your decision. And of course, I completely, I completely respect that. And
1148440	1154200	I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was Dr. Randall. You might run by him then in that
1154200	1161800	case, get his opinion, because he's a proper IR theory person and see what, have you discussed it
1161800	1170200	with him? No, we'll meet on Tuesday. So I will brace this up then. Okay. Because I was saying
1170200	1177160	to Celine, we could perhaps acknowledge him. If he's so sure that he doesn't want to be included
1177160	1184360	in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I just wanted to perhaps it was an Indian idiosyncrasy of the
1184360	1191960	American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would just caution you to find out, Celine,
1192920	1195960	whether it's in a matter he's talking from an American's perspective.
1196680	1201880	When that the same applies in Europe, if that's where you want to end up.
1202520	1208360	All my supervisors are American. Dr. Mosa, Dr. Randall, also the drug supervisor.
1208360	1208680	Sorry.
1213160	1214360	Other than New Carolina.
1215800	1221640	But for sure. I mean, I think sort of the bottom line is it's your decision, of course. And
1223400	1231400	I think I can speak truthfully to say that like, you've definitely contributed a lot. And I think,
1231400	1238520	yeah, you deserve to be credited in some way. And thank you. I mean, you've done a lot to help
1238520	1244440	with the project. So yeah, thank you. Thank you too that I could learn from both of you. I still
1244440	1251320	have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will update you both after I speak to my first
1251320	1258920	supervisor, Dr. Randall. Yeah. Okay. Brilliant. Thanks then. Thanks everyone. Have a great week.
1258920	1262440	Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on email from now on?
1262440	1265320	Yeah, I think email is probably good. April. Okay. Yeah.
1266200	1270680	Right, that's super. Let's stick with that then. Thanks everyone. Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.
1270680	1271480	Bye. Bye. Bye.
