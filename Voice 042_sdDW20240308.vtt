WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
So I guess just a quick update on my end, so I've been, things are coming along, things

00:14.240 --> 00:21.440
are coming along, but it's just, I just need a lot of electrons, so I just have these big

00:21.440 --> 00:28.600
runs is what's going on right now, so I have a preferred model and then I have like 50,

00:28.920 --> 00:34.200
alternative models for robustness, shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all

00:34.200 --> 00:42.600
the electrons, so that's sort of chugging along. I'm almost done, but haven't finished implementing

00:42.600 --> 00:54.760
the Fihan and Solvnik. How can I, yeah. The insum, the insum, so I'm almost done with that.

00:54.840 --> 01:00.520
They, I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to

01:00.520 --> 01:08.280
re-learn it. There's, so I'm doing that and then when I do that, then we'll get an estimate and do

01:08.280 --> 01:13.320
the bootstraps and that's, I think that'll be pretty neat. There's one weird thing about the data

01:13.320 --> 01:17.720
that I discovered, there's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry, before I get there,

01:18.600 --> 01:27.160
I did subset it by just the people who identified as Philippine O and the estimates are about the

01:27.160 --> 01:34.120
same, they're slightly higher, it's something like 47%, depending on how you measure exploitation,

01:34.120 --> 01:39.960
so, but they're about the same, but slightly higher and I haven't done anything else on that,

01:39.960 --> 01:48.200
the data. So, there are two weird sources of errors. The one is, is these, these true zeros,

01:48.200 --> 01:54.200
remember we talked about from a while ago, so people could say that they don't know any, but

01:54.200 --> 01:59.560
okay, sorry, two other things, I should make notes to myself so I can pop size.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.880
You want to record it, Scott? That's okay, I'm, I take furious notes. Record it somewhere, yeah.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.320
But you feel, I don't object, please feel free to if you want to the

02:11.240 --> 02:18.360
pop size. Oh, so you could, people have reported that they know zero domestic workers in the UK

02:18.360 --> 02:24.040
with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone, so that's, we fixed that up, that's fine.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.720
And then there was another one, which is really weird, which is where they, the number of people

02:29.720 --> 02:35.320
they reported knowing, Q13 I'm pretty sure is the one, I know these things are stuck in my head

02:35.320 --> 02:42.680
now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than the, the,

02:44.040 --> 02:52.120
the number of people they recruit, where recruiting is determined by the node one,

02:52.120 --> 02:58.280
node two, the network structure. So that's really weird. I don't, that one took me a while to sort

02:58.280 --> 03:04.680
of, and it's two people, but those two people really, really messed me up. So, so I fixed that.

03:04.680 --> 03:10.760
So, so now we have a new personal degree size, which is the max of all of those.

03:12.440 --> 03:19.400
So it's, it's the max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the

03:19.400 --> 03:25.560
number of people that you recruit as given by the network structure. And like I said, the last one

03:25.560 --> 03:31.080
sort of a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not,

03:31.080 --> 03:34.840
I'm not super worried about it. And then we have these things this thing, we have these suspicious,

03:35.880 --> 03:41.080
suspicious variable. So we can, we can, what I'm trying to say is like, we can, we can remove

03:41.080 --> 03:46.840
the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat. And that's, that's, that's fine. Okay.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.920
So that's that implementing the FIHAN. And so that's just electricity at this point, like it's

03:52.920 --> 03:59.400
just, it's, it's done. And again, the estimates are very, very, very consistent between 30 and 40

03:59.400 --> 04:07.720
percent, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me, that's shockingly high, but it's,

04:07.720 --> 04:14.680
it's very consistent. So in some I'm working on the bootstrap is working. And I'm almost done with

04:14.680 --> 04:23.640
the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff. So we need the, the size of the frame.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.760
So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.160
We needed that for the, the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that.

04:34.440 --> 04:41.000
The preferred number, thanks to you, Caroline, 980,000, I think, something like that came from

04:41.000 --> 04:48.520
Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah. And again, I've found it out. I use,

04:49.480 --> 05:00.040
I use sample frame sizes from 10,000, 100,000, not in the 980,000, 1.5 million, just again,

05:00.040 --> 05:05.480
for robustness. I should probably add, because I think one of the, I don't know what was called,

05:06.040 --> 05:12.680
I drew it down, the, there are these two occupational classes that you used Caroline from.

05:13.240 --> 05:19.720
And, and one of them was like spot on. And then the other one was sort of, was plausible. But

05:19.720 --> 05:25.320
so what I'm trying to say is I should, I should use, so currently the preferred model uses the

05:25.320 --> 05:31.480
sum of those two numbers. But I should, I should, wait, and that's fine. I'm happy to report that

05:31.480 --> 05:37.400
and everything. But again, for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated

05:37.400 --> 05:45.080
whatever. So that's, that's, that's for me to do. Now, the probalters. So we need to know this,

05:45.080 --> 05:49.560
I only have one, and that's the number of people, you know, who have been referred to

05:50.280 --> 05:56.760
the National Referral Mechanism, or whatever it's called, NRM. So we have that question.

05:57.640 --> 06:04.840
And we, thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people in the UK, like we know the size

06:04.920 --> 06:13.160
of that group. And so, I'm sorry, I'm rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two

06:13.160 --> 06:17.640
population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame, which we needed from before.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.200
And there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the in sum, we also need the

06:22.200 --> 06:27.400
size of these probalter groups. So I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. And it

06:27.400 --> 06:33.160
just sort of, just sort of adds some complexity to, it adds noise really to these estimators. So I

06:33.240 --> 06:39.080
haven't done that. That's going to be more electrons, more electrons to use. So right,

06:39.080 --> 06:44.200
probalter group, that was the other pop size. And I told you about the weird, this thing with the

06:44.200 --> 06:49.560
people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry, I don't know how to count. And that's

06:49.560 --> 06:55.240
where I'm at. So sorry, I didn't, again, sorry, I was coding furiously, hoping I could get it done

06:55.240 --> 07:01.160
before three, but then I thought I didn't know how to read my calendar. So sorry about that. So,

07:01.640 --> 07:03.720
so that's sort of the update on my end. Data is

07:03.720 --> 07:08.280
I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress. And I

07:08.280 --> 07:12.120
suppose the question is, what do you need from us? So I think, I think we're good to

07:13.960 --> 07:24.360
electrons. That's fine. I think we're ready for venue discussion, where we want to submit it.

07:24.360 --> 07:30.280
And Slim, were we able to, did the Zoteros references work for you? I don't know. I sent

07:31.240 --> 07:35.880
it. It did. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So basically, so what I'm trying to say, I think, I think we're,

07:35.880 --> 07:41.720
we're into like, once, while my batch is running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you

07:41.720 --> 07:48.120
know, writing up the results, conclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like, yeah.

07:49.240 --> 07:56.040
Okay, that's fantastic. So in terms of journal targets, I mean, the question is, I suppose,

07:56.680 --> 08:04.120
within the business school, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list.

08:04.120 --> 08:11.160
With ABS? Sorry. If I can, Association of Business School, Journal Quality List,

08:12.920 --> 08:19.960
the school signs up to the Dora principles that it's not all about journal destination,

08:19.960 --> 08:25.480
but it is a factor. So one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal target is

08:25.560 --> 08:31.880
that list. Okay. But I tend to publish anywhere that, so I have not really been following the rules

08:31.880 --> 08:38.520
very strictly. And I don't know what your publication targets might look like. And so I'm

08:38.520 --> 08:44.520
quite happy to be ecumenical about this, and not necessarily pick a journal off that list,

08:44.520 --> 08:52.840
just because that's what you're supposed to do. But, but having said that, there is one journal

08:52.840 --> 08:57.880
potentially, which is a three star journal. So it's not an absolute top quality, but it's

08:57.880 --> 09:09.240
a rectangle called Work Employment and Society, which has a strong theoretical basis. So I don't

09:09.240 --> 09:14.040
know whether, well, that would mean that I would need to do some background work on,

09:14.040 --> 09:18.840
they definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's sort of sociologically focused.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.120
And the advantage is one of the editor-in-chiefs is actually Marek,

09:25.080 --> 09:32.360
Causes Inksteed, who is, yeah, who's obviously at the business school. So I could sound him out

09:32.920 --> 09:37.720
and just say, would you accept a sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated

09:37.720 --> 09:43.160
paper in the domestic workers sphere? Is that something that you think might fall within this

09:43.160 --> 09:51.320
scope of the journal? So that was the target that sort of occurred to me, but I'm very open to

09:51.320 --> 09:56.920
publishing where it would suit you, Scott. I mean, I think the ABS list is a great place to start.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.720
Because I know nothing about this, this field at all. But it sounds like, I mean,

10:04.520 --> 10:09.320
yeah, more stars is better in general for me. But at the same time, like I'm not,

10:10.040 --> 10:14.840
like you, Caroline, like I'm not, I'm not picky about these things. But, you know,

10:15.960 --> 10:21.640
my general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down the tears as the rejection

10:21.640 --> 10:29.080
ladder just come, come in, which in my case, they, they fill up my mailbox. So that would be,

10:29.800 --> 10:38.120
yeah, so I mean, ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are sort of appropriate for, you know,

10:38.120 --> 10:46.280
labor, domestic work, UK, human rights, whatever, and start there and yeah, work our way down would be,

10:46.280 --> 10:49.880
I guess one of the things I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important

10:49.880 --> 11:01.720
is, so the strategy I just articulated is, is a lengthy process. So, so I guess we should talk

11:01.720 --> 11:06.120
about timeline. Are there are people going in for promotion or jobs or other, are there,

11:06.680 --> 11:10.680
is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or?

11:10.680 --> 11:15.960
I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know, how

11:15.960 --> 11:21.800
does that sound for you? Yeah, again, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm okay taking time and doing the, the

11:22.440 --> 11:27.080
start high. And when's the next, do we know when the ref cycle ends? I don't, I don't know. When is it?

11:27.720 --> 11:32.840
Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's ref 2029 now. But when the actual

11:32.840 --> 11:41.480
ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline for paper submissions is, I don't know, but I mean

11:41.480 --> 11:49.320
24, we've got a few, we've got enough time to try a higher journal and then knock down to it. So

11:49.320 --> 11:54.760
we, I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars. If you think we'd like to

11:54.760 --> 11:59.400
start with that. That would be my preference, if that's it. If, if there's, yeah, that would be

11:59.400 --> 12:04.280
my preference. I'd like, I'd like you, I don't, I don't have time constraints. Somewhere like the

12:04.280 --> 12:12.120
British Journal of Management. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view,

12:12.120 --> 12:18.280
a bit of a quantitative bias. So that might work in our favor. And I can have a bit of a

12:19.320 --> 12:24.360
search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But I mean,

12:24.440 --> 12:31.240
the fact that it's UK statistics might be quite appropriate for them. We just,

12:32.360 --> 12:39.400
we just might need to sort of cite it in their literature to sort of see what debates they're,

12:39.400 --> 12:48.520
they're talking about. So that's a bit of work for me to do. And then, yeah, see what I mean,

12:48.520 --> 12:56.520
I asked our Dean and Alex to our terms about this. And he suggested research policy

12:57.320 --> 13:03.880
and science. Okay. Neither of those journals I know anything about. I did look at the

13:05.240 --> 13:13.640
aims and scope and to me, didn't seem to fit. But that was his initial suggestion. I don't know

13:13.640 --> 13:19.480
if you know anything about science. Science is absolutely top. But yeah, it's a strange

13:19.480 --> 13:25.720
fit. I wouldn't, I think of them as doing more like biology kinds of stuff. I mean,

13:25.720 --> 13:31.240
basically, what they do is like really, really high profile stuff, regardless of field. And so

13:31.240 --> 13:39.240
maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is high profile, maybe. But yeah,

13:39.320 --> 13:42.280
it's said to be as an odd, as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.280
Yeah. I've heard of you. Do you know anything about research policy?

13:46.280 --> 13:52.120
No, but I think policy sounds like a good, a good class of journals to maybe target.

13:52.840 --> 14:00.440
Although we don't really have any policy implications currently, but, but that could,

14:00.440 --> 14:05.080
that could be strengthened perhaps. Yeah, that brings to mind another journal called Millbank

14:05.080 --> 14:10.760
Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're

14:11.480 --> 14:17.720
A, B, B, S. That's possible from a policy point of view, but maybe British Journal of Management

14:17.720 --> 14:28.360
is better. Excellent. Yeah. So, and then I suppose work, employment and society, if we fail with

14:28.360 --> 14:34.680
BJM, it's like the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. Good. Excellent. Excellent.

14:34.680 --> 14:38.680
That's great. That's great. That's great. That sounds all right. Sounds great for me.

14:40.360 --> 14:46.520
So if I do a bit of a literature search, the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until

14:46.520 --> 14:52.120
April. That's fine. And I've got seminar weeks coming up. So, and my diary is absolutely chock

14:52.120 --> 14:59.960
block. So the, the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days, I think I could perhaps spend

14:59.960 --> 15:05.960
some time. Actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well. So

15:07.560 --> 15:15.800
I can do, make a start on that then. And then, so at least get you sort of some indication and

15:16.760 --> 15:22.520
yeah, but we, I think British Journal of Management does seem to be quite a good fit. And that's,

15:22.520 --> 15:26.520
that's a good journal. Excellent. If we get into that. Let's, let's start there. Let's start there.

15:26.520 --> 15:35.560
I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week, because like you, the next two to

15:35.560 --> 15:40.360
three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff. But I'm,

15:41.320 --> 15:46.760
reading week has been good and I'm making, so I'm going to make a push to try to get, you know,

15:48.520 --> 15:54.680
the results done. Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team. It's

15:54.680 --> 15:59.640
really, really, really, really great. It's been fantastic working with the both of you. So thank

15:59.640 --> 16:05.800
you. Yeah, so it'd be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah,

16:05.800 --> 16:13.720
if we were to aim to do that for the summer, is that too, is that all right? I think by the time

16:13.720 --> 16:20.440
we sort of tidied everything up. Yeah. And then, yeah. Yeah, June, I think it was a good target.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.440
And July, if we get, if we miss, you know, I think that's a, I think it's very feasible as well.

16:24.440 --> 16:30.680
I mean, like I said, the right sort of April, we'll, we'll be able to come back to it and polish and

16:30.680 --> 16:37.320
then, you know, yeah. And I'm hoping next term might be quite as bad as this term. I'll have a

16:37.320 --> 16:43.560
little bit, it'll be just marking then. Just marking. It just never ends. It just never ends. So

16:46.040 --> 16:52.440
but okay, this is great. I'm going to, I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll, I'll email you

16:52.440 --> 16:59.240
with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the, I'm not expecting any

16:59.240 --> 17:05.240
surprise. So the RDS stuff is done, done. And then the insum, I don't know. I'm not expecting to be

17:05.240 --> 17:12.280
surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. Fantastic. Really, really good. Was there anything from you

17:12.280 --> 17:19.240
Selene that you wanted to share with us? I have two points. First, Dr. Moser, do you have anything

17:19.240 --> 17:26.120
that you need from my side other than the sort of references? Is there anything else? That's it.

17:27.080 --> 17:33.080
And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We started with BigBot. You may have

17:33.080 --> 17:40.520
seen my email that I don't want to be included in the publication for this research. What do you

17:40.520 --> 17:48.920
think about that? I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your, to your PhD advisor, Dr.

17:48.920 --> 17:54.360
Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need, if you want to stay in academia, you need publications.

17:54.360 --> 18:02.120
And in the past, you've mentioned sort of wanting to fortify your quantitative

18:02.920 --> 18:10.920
credentials. And this would certainly help with that. I mean, I think I understand his point.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.840
If I'm not saying this point, it's something like branding, like you don't want to get labeled as

18:14.840 --> 18:20.360
something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just, you need publications

18:20.360 --> 18:26.120
and full stop. So, I wasn't from Dr. Randall. I have to say it's not from Dr. Randall. It's from

18:26.120 --> 18:33.640
the mentor in the US when I spent time there, because I'm still having meetings with the professor

18:33.640 --> 18:40.600
there. And I see he is also the Dean of the department for international relations and politics.

18:40.600 --> 18:49.240
And recently we had another meeting and he told me it would be not good if I have a profile

18:49.240 --> 18:55.800
that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that. And I,

18:57.080 --> 19:02.680
and I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I don't include my name.

19:02.680 --> 19:07.560
I mean, it's one, it's your decision. And of course, I completely, I completely respect that. And

19:08.440 --> 19:14.200
I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was Dr. Randall. You might run by him then in that

19:14.200 --> 19:21.800
case, get his opinion, because he's a proper IR theory person and see what, have you discussed it

19:21.800 --> 19:30.200
with him? No, we'll meet on Tuesday. So I will brace this up then. Okay. Because I was saying

19:30.200 --> 19:37.160
to Celine, we could perhaps acknowledge him. If he's so sure that he doesn't want to be included

19:37.160 --> 19:44.360
in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I just wanted to perhaps it was an Indian idiosyncrasy of the

19:44.360 --> 19:51.960
American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would just caution you to find out, Celine,

19:52.920 --> 19:55.960
whether it's in a matter he's talking from an American's perspective.

19:56.680 --> 20:01.880
When that the same applies in Europe, if that's where you want to end up.

20:02.520 --> 20:08.360
All my supervisors are American. Dr. Mosa, Dr. Randall, also the drug supervisor.

20:08.360 --> 20:08.680
Sorry.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.360
Other than New Carolina.

20:15.800 --> 20:21.640
But for sure. I mean, I think sort of the bottom line is it's your decision, of course. And

20:23.400 --> 20:31.400
I think I can speak truthfully to say that like, you've definitely contributed a lot. And I think,

20:31.400 --> 20:38.520
yeah, you deserve to be credited in some way. And thank you. I mean, you've done a lot to help

20:38.520 --> 20:44.440
with the project. So yeah, thank you. Thank you too that I could learn from both of you. I still

20:44.440 --> 20:51.320
have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will update you both after I speak to my first

20:51.320 --> 20:58.920
supervisor, Dr. Randall. Yeah. Okay. Brilliant. Thanks then. Thanks everyone. Have a great week.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.440
Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on email from now on?

21:02.440 --> 21:05.320
Yeah, I think email is probably good. April. Okay. Yeah.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.680
Right, that's super. Let's stick with that then. Thanks everyone. Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.480
Bye. Bye. Bye.
