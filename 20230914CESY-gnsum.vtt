WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
there you go there you go sorry for being late thanks for tech problems you

00:07.320 --> 00:13.080
know how it is but I got all of your documents I've read them in skimmed is

00:13.080 --> 00:18.840
probably a more accurate word but I've got my coffee I've got my pen I'm

00:18.840 --> 00:26.200
eager to get into it so thank you you're absolutely right with those things

00:26.960 --> 00:35.160
that is what we need to work out sorry I'm not arriving with a map saying this

00:35.160 --> 00:40.200
is how we we have to proceed I think it's something that we will find our way

00:40.200 --> 00:49.160
through the jungle between us I hope so I mean already you're pointing us in the

00:49.160 --> 00:56.160
direction of bootstrapping has been invaluable so yeah we really just sort of

00:56.160 --> 01:01.400
feeling a way through the next steps to understand who's actually say what to do

01:01.400 --> 01:08.720
and who's doing what right yeah that's all

01:08.720 --> 01:16.120
I mean it might be an ongoing conversation it might be something we can't bottom now but it probably is a good idea also to discuss sort of time

01:16.120 --> 01:21.880
frames that or at least share what we have in our own minds about time frame

01:21.880 --> 01:26.200
so that we can see whether whether everything matches together or whether

01:26.200 --> 01:35.800
there are going to be problems yeah so yeah so in terms of what's next you

01:35.800 --> 01:40.480
talked about the objective and the division of labour well the objective

01:40.480 --> 01:46.440
remains really to generate this estimate of the hidden population among

01:46.440 --> 01:52.160
domestic workers as far as we are able to and you you can generalize network

01:52.160 --> 01:59.440
scale-up methods to do that I mean that's the the overriding objective and

01:59.440 --> 02:03.280
then how we do that I mean I think that's a matter of debate we I think as I

02:03.280 --> 02:07.160
mentioned in my email have you seen it we've got Selim with us definitely full

02:07.200 --> 02:11.280
time until the end of the month so again this comes into the time frame

02:11.280 --> 02:19.880
conversation can we make maximum use of Selim's time now and then there's the

02:19.880 --> 02:25.020
possibility I mean Selim come in here now if you want to but I believe

02:25.020 --> 02:33.180
Selim's keen to continue looking at this yeah so you don't need to share my screen

02:33.180 --> 02:37.460
yeah what you don't want to be able to share this so Dr. Moseley you sent this

02:37.460 --> 02:45.420
article about the yoke yoke at all pay but who's on 22 for the neighborhood so

02:45.420 --> 02:51.220
I've tried to understand it and and also work on it and what I understand is that

02:51.260 --> 02:59.300
we need certain points or aspects to perform that bootstrap for our data set

02:59.300 --> 03:07.540
and that is like the notes this is the list of our IDs basically and then we

03:07.540 --> 03:12.500
have the edges and then we have the trades and degree so all that stuff I

03:12.500 --> 03:17.980
have tried to put this down to the Excel spreadsheet I'm going to share it now so

03:17.980 --> 03:27.180
you can tell me to what extent it looks cleaned up can you see it yes I can see

03:27.180 --> 03:30.840
it thank you very much okay yeah so you're 100% right Selim so the I was

03:30.840 --> 03:38.420
thinking about this this morning the the so I did have a quick look at the

03:38.420 --> 03:45.180
okay let me take half a step back so by the way Caroline not that you need to

03:45.180 --> 03:49.740
hear it for me but kudos your your lit review the document that you sent was

03:49.740 --> 03:56.100
really really really spot-on but the so taking a whole step back the the

03:56.100 --> 04:01.780
neighborhood boot is it's building on this thing called a tree okay so what's

04:01.780 --> 04:04.620
the issue the issue is we want to bootstrapping but we definitely don't

04:04.620 --> 04:07.620
have independence here Caroline's you rightly mentioned you know at best we

04:07.620 --> 04:12.620
have a convenience sample in our DS so the issue is how do you bootstrapping in

04:12.620 --> 04:17.660
these in this setting where you don't have independence whatsoever and so these

04:17.660 --> 04:21.980
clever people have different ideas and there's this very very sophisticated and

04:21.980 --> 04:26.660
I confess I didn't fully comprehend it but there's this tree method which is

04:26.660 --> 04:31.540
meant to anyway doesn't matter then these other people as you both rightly said

04:31.540 --> 04:35.300
come along and say actually there's an easier and better way to do this called

04:35.300 --> 04:39.100
this neighborhood boot and and you're 100% right Selim that what's crucial here

04:39.100 --> 04:44.420
is we need we need we need IDs we need to be able to uniquely identify each

04:44.420 --> 04:49.660
respondent and then we need to know who referred who and so usually that that

04:49.660 --> 04:53.740
takes the form of what's called an adjacency matrix this is just a graph so

04:53.740 --> 04:59.100
you've got the nodes are the are the IDs and so if I'm person 60 and you're a

04:59.100 --> 05:05.740
person 41 and I refer you then there's an edge from person 60 to person 41 you

05:05.740 --> 05:08.900
get the idea and so on and so forth so that's the sort of the structure of the

05:08.900 --> 05:16.700
data well that's one of the that's one component of the data that will need to

05:16.700 --> 05:19.780
do this this neighborhood bootstrap that the idea behind the input was really

05:19.780 --> 05:24.460
kind of surprising to me that it works so well but it does and we can sit sit

05:24.460 --> 05:27.940
site and that's great but the idea is you just take everybody who refers

05:27.940 --> 05:33.980
anybody and you just you just sample with replacement them and turns out that

05:33.980 --> 05:38.980
works really well it's it's sort of surprisingly simple and and but at least

05:38.980 --> 05:45.540
according to the papers it seems to work really really well so so so that's the

05:45.540 --> 05:49.060
structure that we need so right so now I'm rambling coffee's just now kicking

05:49.060 --> 05:54.620
in sorry so so Selim we need unique IDs for every single every single person and

05:54.620 --> 06:00.700
then we need to know who referred who so thank you for sharing your screen so

06:00.700 --> 06:07.660
like on line three it's a recruiter so you got node one recruiter and then node

06:07.660 --> 06:13.820
two respondent recruit I don't understand can you flush that out for me I can I

06:13.820 --> 06:19.700
can walk you through thank you so what we see here are the IDs of the people so

06:19.700 --> 06:26.500
for some two is the ID person three four five these are the ID of the people and

06:26.500 --> 06:31.780
when when there's written note one that's the recruiter that is 60 so when

06:31.780 --> 06:39.460
we scroll down to 60 here we are seeing that is Anna here that would be Anna so

06:39.460 --> 06:49.140
Anna has preferred on recruiting the second one so 60 ID 60 has recruited or

06:49.140 --> 06:55.860
referred person ID to and when there's no number written this means they haven't

06:56.140 --> 07:04.020
recruited they just complete the survey based on the promotion that our NGO

07:04.020 --> 07:10.020
partners has forwarded to their to their own people so these are the seeds so this

07:10.020 --> 07:17.220
right okay and then we can continue with that for some 41 has recruited 10 and

07:17.380 --> 07:25.860
and six these are these other people good good yeah good good good so then that's

07:25.860 --> 07:31.380
excellent thank you so then the next step would be to turn that into an adjacency

07:31.380 --> 07:39.180
matrix I'm trying to think of the can you if you maybe already have sorry if you

07:39.180 --> 07:42.780
have something but could you email me that excel file and I can have a think on

07:42.780 --> 07:54.500
the easiest way to reshape this into an adjacency matrix yeah yeah I read and

07:54.500 --> 07:59.820
I think there's something like zero and one yeah exactly so where where do we have

07:59.820 --> 08:07.740
like where do these connections exist exactly yeah so I will send you the

08:07.740 --> 08:12.860
excellent spreadsheet and you will tell me what to do next yeah after a lot more

08:12.860 --> 08:18.660
coffee yeah so but just to be clear so this is this is only relevant for the

08:18.660 --> 08:24.100
for the bootstrapping which I think we're all on board with is this is the

08:24.100 --> 08:31.260
way to go with with these uncertainty estimates the I mean I guess you know we

08:31.260 --> 08:36.380
could start with the calculations already right I mean Caroline you're you're I

08:36.380 --> 08:41.860
know we call it memo or outline of sort of what how to proceed with the

08:41.860 --> 08:46.700
calculations we could we could start with that given the data that we have I

08:46.700 --> 08:54.140
think so that protocol that I sent through that had the different sum

08:54.140 --> 09:00.140
quantities and actually the sort of the translation of the formula into our from

09:00.900 --> 09:10.340
results into fiend and salgonics equations yes yes yes yes yes yes exactly

09:10.340 --> 09:18.340
sorry sorry again fresh cup of coffee yeah I mean that would be our sample our

09:18.340 --> 09:22.420
original sample data but without the bootstrapping exactly so we would be

09:22.420 --> 09:27.100
doing a first pass through with our raw data I don't know I'm using the right

09:27.100 --> 09:34.120
terminology as the first the first approach to actually plugging some

09:34.120 --> 09:39.020
data in and getting some output yeah that's right so this would just be point

09:39.020 --> 09:43.100
estimates without without any kind of uncertainty the end you're right the

09:43.100 --> 09:50.340
bootstrapping would be a post hoc or ex post it would come later I think it's

09:50.340 --> 09:55.860
gonna I think it's neat I think it's a nice contribution it's as slim as

09:55.860 --> 10:02.620
intimated it's gonna take a bit more work to to structure the data in a way

10:02.620 --> 10:06.420
that is amenable to doing this neighborhood bootstrap but we can we can

10:06.420 --> 10:11.900
we can do that I mean I should have prepared more for this I'm sorry about

10:11.900 --> 10:20.540
that I mean drink my coffee oh really it's it's definitely we're feeling our

10:20.540 --> 10:26.020
way here so this is definitely a joint process the feelings mutual feelings

10:26.020 --> 10:31.980
mutual and please stop you're gonna blush like a like a pink pig if you

10:31.980 --> 10:36.300
anyway thank you very much with the feelings mutual I'm very much I guess

10:36.300 --> 10:41.780
and again I'm so sorry for my completely scattered emails and behavior this

10:41.780 --> 10:47.420
morning a few questions come to mind so I take your point Caroline thank you

10:47.420 --> 10:52.140
very much for the the clarity on you know I think we all see what the

10:52.140 --> 10:56.020
objective is and the tasks that are required we need to do these calculations

10:56.020 --> 11:00.860
we need to get these uncertainty estimates a few questions that popped my

11:00.860 --> 11:07.140
mind are things like audience or and I think Salimi mentioned a journal journal

11:07.140 --> 11:15.180
so like so what what do we want this paper to look like is this a methods

11:15.180 --> 11:19.060
paper is this a substance paper is it a little from column A a little from column

11:19.060 --> 11:28.100
B is it you know what what um what what do we want the yeah who do we want the

11:28.100 --> 11:34.220
paper to be for I guess is probably better yeah so I'm I'm wondering whether

11:34.220 --> 11:40.980
it could go into a modern slavery journal if it isn't a methods paper which

11:40.980 --> 11:45.140
I suspect it isn't I think we're not really going to make a contribution to

11:45.140 --> 11:50.620
methods we're going to be using methods in an interesting way we hope to

11:50.620 --> 11:58.780
produce an output but actually the the interest is in the the application of

11:58.780 --> 12:04.940
this method to a particular social situation and which is looking at labor

12:04.940 --> 12:11.180
exploitation among domestic workers in the UK and somewhere like the Journal of

12:11.180 --> 12:16.900
Modern Slavery might be interested in the application of this method because

12:16.900 --> 12:23.500
there have been recommendations from GFMS which is the Global Fund for Ending

12:23.500 --> 12:28.380
Modern Slavery that these sorts of techniques ought to be used but as yet

12:28.380 --> 12:33.980
there isn't any as far as I'm aware anyone who's tried to do it yeah so that

12:33.980 --> 12:38.660
would probably protect us a little bit from the purists who would say well

12:38.700 --> 12:43.900
you're really not using your method as appropriate as pristinely as perhaps you

12:43.900 --> 12:51.300
could have done but it would perhaps meet the needs of a community for an

12:51.300 --> 12:56.260
example of how this method was used but also providing some as you say a little

12:56.260 --> 12:59.860
bit of common and a little bit but providing some substance that would be

12:59.860 --> 13:05.540
of interest so potentially I mean I don't know whether you're interested in

13:05.540 --> 13:10.940
publishing in that sort of journal it's not high-ranking but it is this is sort

13:10.940 --> 13:16.900
of it's bread and butter how does that sound oh yeah yeah yeah I'm interested

13:16.900 --> 13:20.420
in publishing anywhere I mean not literally anywhere but I mean I'm I'm

13:20.420 --> 13:25.260
very very open to I'm not at all purists or snob or anything but yeah

13:25.260 --> 13:33.780
that's absolutely fine for me so then I guess the what's next is sort of you

13:33.780 --> 13:37.500
know tasks and I think I think you're you're right Caroline that we're yeah

13:37.500 --> 13:40.540
we're not gonna make a methodological contribution I think the contribution is

13:40.540 --> 13:46.180
applying these techniques to this and you're right I've been I've only seen G

13:46.180 --> 13:52.980
and some used in very limited applications and I agree with you I've

13:52.980 --> 13:56.580
never seen it for for modern slavery and certainly not modern slavery in the UK so

13:56.580 --> 14:02.660
I think that's absolutely a contribution so I guess what's next is as you said

14:02.660 --> 14:08.580
times of the essence so yeah who does who does what when

14:10.980 --> 14:18.020
well I'm very happy to lead on the writing if that's oh yeah yeah I mean

14:18.020 --> 14:24.020
that's what I'm trying to collect in terms of keeping memos of our meeting

14:24.020 --> 14:31.180
so that I can generate a methodological section I know Salim and I are just

14:31.300 --> 14:35.180
about to publish a report on the descriptive statistics related to this

14:35.180 --> 14:43.300
work good so Salim's done quite a lot of work we had our survey checked through

14:43.300 --> 14:47.540
by the director of labor market enforcement directors team and they

14:47.540 --> 14:51.660
were particularly interested from a descriptive point of view in differences

14:51.660 --> 14:56.860
between employment statuses in domestic workers so we have a report coming out

14:56.860 --> 15:00.980
we're just talking about the date but we think it'll be the 9th of October that

15:00.980 --> 15:05.060
focuses very much on different employment statuses which draws on

15:05.060 --> 15:10.500
description descriptive statistics from that so that sort of side has been done

15:10.500 --> 15:17.180
good but it I see this work as sort of feeding directly into a journal output

15:17.180 --> 15:23.100
but when as I mentioned last time when I did do a blog about this for

15:23.100 --> 15:28.100
international domestic workers day there is a lot of press interest so we're

15:28.100 --> 15:36.500
talking to BBC's Midlands about the descriptive stats and we think they'll

15:36.500 --> 15:41.900
plan to cover that in conjunction with the NGOs that we'd be working with

15:41.900 --> 15:48.140
providing they get some case studies that's what's important for them but I

15:48.140 --> 15:52.900
think there's ongoing interest in this and that once we've got something more

15:52.900 --> 15:59.420
solid from a hidden population side I think they'll cover that too so I don't

15:59.420 --> 16:05.460
the report is sort of a stage on the journey and I think the paper would be

16:05.460 --> 16:12.500
another like a second stage another way marker and so that's how I'm seeing it

16:12.500 --> 16:17.900
at present we've already submit our descriptive well one analysis from the

16:17.900 --> 16:22.540
descriptive statistics to a director of labor market enforcement consultation

16:22.540 --> 16:28.260
that closed a couple of weeks ago so that was sort of preempting some of the

16:28.260 --> 16:36.580
figures that Salim's created from the report so we're hoping that this sort

16:36.580 --> 16:43.540
of cumulative effect will sway policy because at the moment domestic workers

16:43.540 --> 16:48.180
aren't identified as a sector of particular concern by the labor market

16:48.180 --> 16:53.860
enforcement director and we're pressing to try and get them on the agenda so if

16:53.860 --> 16:59.220
you like that's the impact case good excellent no thank you it's very very

16:59.220 --> 17:02.700
helpful and I will leave all the impact and all the writing to you Caroline

17:02.700 --> 17:06.180
because that is not my comparative advantage and clearly it is it is yours

17:06.180 --> 17:09.540
but I think that's fantastic and I think you're right that the congratulations

17:09.540 --> 17:11.780
by the way that just sounds really exciting to be honest with you that just

17:11.780 --> 17:16.100
sounds really neat but if things is very helpful so if I'm

17:17.020 --> 17:23.780
so I think I'm getting more focused now the the essentially you've cleaved off

17:23.780 --> 17:28.060
the descriptive stuff which kudos like I think I mentioned in an email that the

17:28.060 --> 17:31.740
survey that you have is really rich so there's tons of opportunity for

17:31.740 --> 17:36.300
descriptive so by the way please send it over I'd love to just look at it and

17:36.300 --> 17:42.540
just see what's going on if you don't mind right but the point is for this

17:42.540 --> 17:46.860
paper we're taking a much more focus it's much more focus it's GN some it's

17:46.860 --> 17:51.180
hidden population and and that's that and and and then the impact stuff can

17:51.180 --> 17:54.780
can can can follow if I'm understanding you so that sounds great that's that's

17:54.780 --> 17:59.820
that's very useful it's very helpful to sort of have that in in in mind so then

17:59.820 --> 18:04.980
I mean I guess in terms of division of labor like we decided to get down to it

18:04.980 --> 18:12.900
so the if I remember correctly so there's there's six different estimators in

18:12.900 --> 18:17.380
the that paper is just the more I read it and reread it the sort of the second

18:17.380 --> 18:21.380
onion it just keeps getting like it's just there's all these layers that I

18:21.380 --> 18:24.020
didn't know and I thought I've read it really carefully by the way saline you

18:24.020 --> 18:27.900
get all the credit for this because you you wouldn't we had a dissertation

18:27.900 --> 18:32.540
meeting I'm rambling point is I love that paper it's weird the more I read it

18:32.540 --> 18:36.900
the weirder it gets so there's these six different estimators I think Carolina

18:36.900 --> 18:42.580
you focused on two of interest and I had suggested that maybe we could sort of

18:42.580 --> 18:48.620
augment them 23 and 24 or something like that doesn't matter um they have these

18:48.620 --> 18:54.620
bounds for these these three different adjustment factors and I think we

18:54.620 --> 18:59.060
decided although I'm certainly open to revisiting this that we could ask that

18:59.140 --> 19:03.140
we could calculate two of the adjustment factors and that the visibility

19:07.780 --> 19:14.820
the true positive rate was going to be difficult but maybe with this last email

19:16.500 --> 19:22.020
maybe we could just there might be some kind of hack if we could make this somewhat

19:22.100 --> 19:30.820
Herculean assumption that people people in age that know people in they've gone

19:30.820 --> 19:37.260
through the national referral mechanism those people know the person in age that

19:37.260 --> 19:45.020
makes sense it doesn't make sense the issue for what I remember the issue with

19:45.020 --> 19:50.620
the visibility is the the true positive rate is that you need to know and this is

19:50.860 --> 19:55.100
my opinion one of the weaknesses of G and some is it's really cognitively demanding so you need

19:55.100 --> 20:01.980
to sample from age and you'd ask people in the hidden population about what people in the sample

20:01.980 --> 20:11.420
frame know about them exactly exactly exactly you're speaking better than than than I am um

20:12.700 --> 20:17.340
there are these sort of hacks I mentioned that maybe we could I mean we should try it out and

20:17.420 --> 20:22.540
then just you know report it honestly or not report it if there's nothing interesting to

20:23.580 --> 20:29.180
report but but and Caroline you seem to be from what I remember in your email that you somewhat

20:29.180 --> 20:33.900
positive about this assumption that people have gone through the national referral mechanism

20:35.260 --> 20:41.900
know I don't know how to say this in English if if someone who's in the hidden population

20:42.380 --> 20:47.100
reports knowing eight people they've gone through the the national referral mechanism

20:47.820 --> 20:55.340
can we assume that all eight of those people know that the person responding the person in age

20:55.980 --> 21:02.700
is in the hidden population and if we can make that assumption then we can I think we can calculate

21:02.780 --> 21:21.900
this the third um the third um adjustment factor that's really interesting I mean I'm sorry sorry

21:22.780 --> 21:29.420
yeah I'm sorry no it's it's very very strange because it's all these I don't have a clear

21:29.420 --> 21:35.740
head for it okay so we can so we sample people and then some of them there were there's referrals

21:35.740 --> 21:40.300
and oh by by the way just really really quick and I'm sorry again to be so scattered the um

21:41.500 --> 21:45.500
so how does the recruitment work you give them coupons is there a fixed number of coupons

21:45.500 --> 21:53.020
or is it just as many people as they want to refer no it was um contact telephone contact numbers

21:53.980 --> 21:59.260
and I think they had up to five is that correct can you remember on the survey okay but they

21:59.260 --> 22:06.860
could refer up to five people okay um mobile phone number so that was effectively acting as a unique

22:06.860 --> 22:12.300
coupon identifier right good good thank you thank you that's I just right back okay so so we have

22:12.300 --> 22:20.700
the sample and and it's uh and it comes in waves thanks to referrals and that's all that's fine it's

22:20.700 --> 22:26.140
absolutely no problem some of okay let me start differently we have a sample from the sampling

22:26.140 --> 22:30.620
frame which is domestic workers in the UK so it's very well defined well they have a mobile number

22:31.180 --> 22:36.300
fine perfectly well defined excellent fantastic so that's that's that's the sampling frame some of

22:36.300 --> 22:42.220
those people happen to be in the hidden population that we just sort of lucked out to to to get and

22:42.220 --> 22:48.540
we can identify them through a number of Caroline you have a much better grasp on this than I but

22:48.540 --> 22:54.700
there's half a dozen different questions that we could use to to or combinations thereof to

22:54.700 --> 23:03.100
identify um oh yeah that's another thing I should before I forget risk um uh that we can identify

23:03.100 --> 23:08.940
okay fine so I'm I'm tabling that and leaving it to you all the experts um so we sort of we just

23:09.020 --> 23:19.660
all happen to have some people in in age in our sample now the the the probalters are

23:20.780 --> 23:24.300
what I originally thought there was only one but Caroline you've really pointed out that we

23:24.300 --> 23:30.860
actually have more than that so one is domestic workers so how many domestic workers working in

23:30.860 --> 23:37.020
the UK that have a mobile number do you know so that's fine we we we have officials I think

23:37.020 --> 23:40.540
correct me if I'm wrong we have official statistics on that so we know the the the

23:41.260 --> 23:46.620
that the known size subpopulation so that's fine we can use that for the scale up

23:47.260 --> 23:56.380
yeah that's a big question oh sorry to dampen the fire on that one but among the the visa

23:56.380 --> 24:02.460
situation is a little bit strange so a large number of domestic workers come over on the overseas

24:02.460 --> 24:09.260
domestic worker visa so where we have people from the Philippines so sort of a subsets of our

24:09.260 --> 24:17.580
sample we have a um a population estimate which we can base on the visa issuing numbers but then

24:17.580 --> 24:24.860
there's this other part of the sample so particularly for example people from Latin America who may

24:24.860 --> 24:34.780
come over on a BA visa where they have nationality Spanish or Portuguese nationality so therefore

24:34.780 --> 24:41.820
they have the right to come into the UK to work now that bit is more difficult to estimate

24:43.100 --> 24:48.940
so we could assume that we are only counting people with overseas domestic workers but we

24:48.940 --> 24:55.820
know if we do that we will be artificially limiting the overall population size so our

24:55.820 --> 25:01.740
estimation would be too large so I mean we can make that assumption but we'd have to state that

25:02.620 --> 25:10.220
as a limitation of that approach what makes sense yes yes and thank you and that's again the onion

25:10.220 --> 25:17.260
just keeps getting um could could be is it would it is it less egregious to

25:20.140 --> 25:21.820
I thought this is getting weird

25:25.660 --> 25:30.860
is it is it more palpable to assume that

25:31.820 --> 25:41.260
that people entering on a particular visa no domestic workers they're also on that visa so

25:41.260 --> 25:47.740
for example people from the Philippines yeah that would work that so that that might be one

25:47.740 --> 25:51.580
possible I mean you're right like this is just a limitation we'll just have to say it but I'm

25:51.580 --> 26:06.780
just thinking aloud if we could yeah try to okay right and another way to justify this would be

26:06.780 --> 26:10.940
your from what I understand and you guys know this way better than I do but the dealing with the NGOs

26:10.940 --> 26:17.740
are are it's what I gathered and Craig from wrong they're sort of national or ethnicity specific

26:17.820 --> 26:22.540
is what I gathered so that that might also help with the justification though okay so okay so so

26:24.460 --> 26:31.740
data problem 41 aside um we just so happened to have people in in age and so what's this this

26:31.740 --> 26:38.940
augmented relational data the game of contacts what what they would do is they would take the

26:38.940 --> 26:45.900
people in age and they would ask them how many doctors do you know pro valter and then how many

26:45.900 --> 26:53.500
doctors do you know that know that you're in the hidden population that's a hard question but that's

26:53.500 --> 26:57.900
what's required that's what's required for this third adjustment factor um so we don't have that

26:57.900 --> 27:05.180
that's fine so what I was suggesting is could we assume that so so we don't have doctors we don't

27:05.180 --> 27:11.980
have people named John we have domestic workers in the UK and we have people have gone through the

27:12.060 --> 27:16.060
national referral mechanism so by the just so I'm clear we do have numbers on that don't we

27:17.020 --> 27:22.700
we do okay good so so what I'm suggesting and again it's this is a big assumption and I don't

27:22.700 --> 27:29.020
know if it's justified but could we assume that so just for simplicity let's just say there's two

27:29.020 --> 27:34.380
pro valter groups there's the UK domestic workers who have a mobile number and people that you know

27:34.380 --> 27:39.660
they've gone through the national referral mechanism so if we we do we so happen to have

27:40.460 --> 27:43.900
somebody in in age and we ask them how many people do you know they've gone through the

27:43.900 --> 27:47.900
natural referral mechanism we have that answer we had that's I don't know what it is was question

27:47.900 --> 27:53.660
something could we assume so say so say I'm in age and you just so happen to sample me and I say I

27:53.660 --> 27:57.900
know eight people have gone through the natural referral mechanism could we assume that all eight

27:57.900 --> 28:02.860
of those people that I know that have gone through the natural referral mechanism can we assume that

28:02.860 --> 28:11.420
all eight of them know that I'm in the hidden population if so then I think we could we could

28:11.420 --> 28:16.700
work out all three of these I think more copies needed that we could work out all three of these

28:16.700 --> 28:22.540
adjustment factors now I'm sort of on the one hand that seems like a big assumption on the other hand

28:23.980 --> 28:29.900
it seems plausible but again you guys are the substance experts on this because if I know people

28:29.900 --> 28:33.660
that if I'm in if I'm being exploited I know people have gone through the natural referral

28:33.660 --> 28:41.980
mechanism it doesn't seem too big a leap to think that those people that were sort of can

28:41.980 --> 28:44.780
that we're we're we're into you know that I know them they know me

28:46.460 --> 28:51.660
yeah if I think it's arguable that we could assume it I mean I think we can state our assumptions

28:52.060 --> 28:53.580
yes of course yeah

28:53.580 --> 28:59.900
and and then be challenged on it that's right that's right at least it's uh we can say that

28:59.900 --> 29:04.460
that assumption may not hold true but that's the assumption that we've made for practical purposes

29:04.460 --> 29:08.700
in this study and like I said this is this is this is kind of icing on the cake I mean we don't

29:09.660 --> 29:16.860
you know we don't we don't it's not a deal breaker we don't have to do this I mean we can we've we've

29:16.860 --> 29:20.780
we've got the data we've got and we can do the calculations and do the bootstrap and

29:20.780 --> 29:25.740
and I was just thinking a lot if we could if we could well like I said you know we should

29:25.740 --> 29:32.860
probably just do a bunch of stuff and see what we want to report and uh okay so sorry I'm so

29:32.860 --> 29:41.260
scattered so um so um so what's next who who's going to do what and then I did have one additional

29:41.260 --> 29:46.700
sort of okay so so so what's next so what I think is we just need to start doing calculations so we

29:46.700 --> 29:53.900
need to uh do the insum do the adjustment factors uh personally I really like this idea of

29:55.020 --> 30:03.980
the bounds in the subliminal appendix so basically so my idea is to is to um so say we can't estimate

30:03.980 --> 30:08.700
all three of the adjustment factors we can use a kind of sensitivity analysis and say so we we

30:08.700 --> 30:14.300
know that the true positive rate ranges between zero and one or zero infinity I don't remember

30:14.300 --> 30:18.620
where it is but it's it's in the paper what happens to our estimates of the size of the

30:18.620 --> 30:26.220
hidden population as we just sweep over all of the possible values for this this third adjustment

30:26.220 --> 30:33.660
factor um I kind of like that because it it sort of tells you something about I mean it's that it's

30:33.660 --> 30:39.660
heuristic but it tells you something about about well it tells you something about how important

30:39.660 --> 30:44.940
these adjustment factors are in in estimating the size of the hidden population right if if

30:44.940 --> 30:49.900
if you sweep over all the possible values and the size of the hidden population I mean it's

30:49.900 --> 30:54.700
going to change some who doesn't change by an order of magnitude and that gives you well that tells

30:54.700 --> 30:58.540
you something that that third adjustment factor the true positive rate isn't very important in

30:58.540 --> 31:02.860
this particular instance which is which is something I mean that that's that's information

31:02.860 --> 31:08.060
that's that's that's that's good you know okay so I think we need to just start doing calculations

31:08.060 --> 31:11.580
start doing this these what I'm calling sensitivity analysis but probably is a better word

31:12.460 --> 31:17.340
salim I'm going to put you to work on this adjacency matrix to to to do the the bootstrap

31:19.180 --> 31:25.500
and I'm sorry if I'm sounding bossy or whatnot I'm just I'm just trying to just just okay okay

31:25.500 --> 31:29.180
okay and regarding the method you are

31:29.180 --> 31:30.300
but

31:59.180 --> 32:02.220
and we it might take some time maybe

32:06.540 --> 32:10.220
good thank you see I'm I'm confident you're very capable and I know this from

32:11.180 --> 32:17.820
from years of working with you so um that's great sorry my legs fell asleep um there was one new

32:18.620 --> 32:25.340
thing that uh came up in one of Caroline's emails that I wanted to not not that I want to give us

32:25.900 --> 32:29.020
work to do or me more work to do or us more work to do but um

32:30.780 --> 32:37.260
sorry my fit fall asleep um Caroline you mentioned something about like okay so we mentioned earlier

32:37.260 --> 32:41.980
that there's these we have these different questions that are uh could be used to identify

32:41.980 --> 32:48.940
people in age and then I think Caroline from among you had suggested could be sort of create an index

32:48.940 --> 32:56.300
or an aggregate variable that indicated what I was hearing and I don't know if you said this

32:57.020 --> 33:02.620
something about risk um and I really like that I don't I'm just raising it to see if this is

33:02.620 --> 33:08.780
something we want to explore or put in the paper the the reason okay so look so we have these

33:08.780 --> 33:14.780
different indicators that we could definitely use to indicate if someone is in the hidden population

33:14.780 --> 33:19.180
that's great we can try out different ones and we can put a table and show the comparison and

33:19.180 --> 33:24.220
that that's very cool in and of itself because to my knowledge not a lot of studies do that so

33:24.220 --> 33:30.620
that's another advantage of the of your survey uh Caroline but I think and correct me if I'm wrong

33:30.620 --> 33:38.300
that you had suggested like um could we combine them or sort of some sort of like a likeert scale

33:38.300 --> 33:41.900
is kind of what I had in mind I really I I just want to raise it to see if that's something we

33:41.900 --> 33:46.460
want to explore but the reason I think it's needed is because it's as far as I can tell me again you

33:46.460 --> 33:53.500
all are the experts but when I read about modern slavery there's always this not always but there's

33:53.500 --> 34:02.060
almost always this modern slavery and risk of of uh of experiencing modern slavery and and

34:02.940 --> 34:06.300
what I'm getting at it seems like a lot of the literature that I read again you all are the

34:06.300 --> 34:13.500
experts on this there is this dichotomous component of experiencing modern slavery yes or no but then

34:13.500 --> 34:20.220
there's it seems on from like the policy pages white papers or whatnot that there's this risk

34:20.220 --> 34:26.060
aspect what's the risk of someone being exposed or experiencing modern slavery and and my ears

34:26.060 --> 34:31.500
sort of perked up when I read your email Caroline about combining various questions to get this index

34:31.500 --> 34:35.420
or ranking or I don't I don't remember the language that you used um so I just wanted to raise that

34:35.420 --> 35:00.860
to see if that's something we want to explore uh question mark I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry

35:05.740 --> 35:14.940
say one to seven or one to five against a particular attribute and those attributes are

35:14.940 --> 35:21.820
you saying could be the various questions that we have um designed into the survey

35:22.860 --> 35:30.140
exactly yes yes yes and maybe you're right maybe the liquid scale is too is too strong maybe we

35:30.220 --> 35:35.980
we need something like a factor analysis or something so the way I and it's been since

35:35.980 --> 35:40.540
graduate school since I studied this so I could be wrong but the way I remember liquid scales is that

35:40.540 --> 35:48.620
there's it's a hierarchy right so if if you answered yes to question two then for sure you

35:48.620 --> 35:53.260
answered yes to question one so basically they're these like levels of experiences and from what I

35:53.260 --> 35:58.860
remember the questions kind of some of the questions seem to have that kind of flavor and correct me

35:58.940 --> 36:03.500
if I'm wrong I could be I could be wrong there but but I mean if it's liquid or if it's if it's not

36:03.500 --> 36:08.940
the the the liquid would be great but it's very very strong because it has this hierarchy this

36:08.940 --> 36:15.420
nesting feature attribute but if not then you know some other way of aggregating individual

36:15.420 --> 36:21.180
questions into a the idea is to get away from the dichotomous are you and are you speaking

36:21.180 --> 36:28.700
about slavery yes or no into some sort of gradient where we and then could we sell that the index

36:28.700 --> 36:34.780
or the ranking variable the thing that we make as something akin to risk of experiencing modern

36:34.780 --> 36:46.380
slavery

36:51.100 --> 36:54.380
yes yes 100% take take question

36:54.380 --> 37:00.540
if you answered yes to question one and yes to question two that would put you at a higher

37:00.540 --> 37:06.060
risk of modern slavery and sort of add on to end whatever exactly exactly right exactly right

37:06.060 --> 37:11.580
exactly right sorry you said it way better than I did and much more succinctly as well I'm so sorry

37:11.580 --> 37:16.700
oh boy waking up earlier next time drinking lots more coffee but but and like I said I don't know

37:16.700 --> 37:21.820
if this this is something we want to do I mean it's just again it's where it's it's icing on the

37:21.820 --> 37:27.340
cake it's not we definitely don't need to it's just the idea of risk popped into my head after

37:27.340 --> 37:36.620
reading one of your emails caroline and it rang this bell of a yeah the risk is really interesting

37:36.620 --> 37:43.900
and I think it comes from this criminalization of modern slavery so if you if you're saying that you

37:43.900 --> 37:51.260
are in modern slavery it implies that you've met the legal standard for your whatever conditions

37:51.260 --> 37:59.340
you're experiencing being proven and somebody being prosecuted so that's obviously quite a high bar

38:00.140 --> 38:05.500
and there's obviously a spectrum of labor what might be called labor exploitation rather than

38:05.500 --> 38:13.020
modern slavery which are undesirable conditions but they may not be modern they may not qualify you

38:13.020 --> 38:22.060
as being somebody with positive grounds for a modern slavery case right but the more of these

38:22.060 --> 38:29.180
poor um indicators of conditions that exist the more likely it is that your case would be considered

38:29.820 --> 38:35.340
that of modern slavery so that seems to tie in with what you're suggesting Scott

38:35.820 --> 38:41.260
perfect that's again I couldn't literally I couldn't say say it better myself Caroline yet

38:41.260 --> 38:46.380
that's exactly right and also just to double kill on that we don't we have that from what I remember

38:46.380 --> 38:50.700
reading through the code book we definitely have that there's these you know half a dozen a dozen

38:50.700 --> 38:54.460
different questions that sort of get at these different I don't know angles aspects would have

38:54.460 --> 39:05.020
you so like I mean I think that's yes Caroline yes 100% uh one thank you that's you've said it

39:05.020 --> 39:09.340
better than I did two I'm pretty sure I don't know if we're in a unique position but we definitely

39:10.140 --> 39:14.140
thanks to your survey I believe we have data to do just that and then three

39:15.100 --> 39:21.820
can't count is that something we want to do in this paper yeah we can it would it would seem a neat

39:21.820 --> 39:30.300
way of addressing these multiple instances of exploitation to to say that the more of these

39:30.300 --> 39:36.620
questions that you're demonstrating apply to your situation the more likely it is that you are at risk

39:36.620 --> 39:43.740
and the case we have to say at risk yes modern slavery yes because it's we haven't got legally

39:43.740 --> 39:49.420
improving cases but I think we can legitimately say that excellent okay so now there's more

39:50.060 --> 39:57.420
that's very very cool thank you uh now I just realized do I know how to do that I don't know

39:58.060 --> 40:04.700
I mean the neat thing there is like this might be oh boy I need a lot more coffee so now that I've

40:04.700 --> 40:13.420
just pitched this thing about risk and not a continuous rather than a dichotomous variable now

40:13.420 --> 40:18.620
I'm just now thinking hang on how do you do scale up with

40:21.740 --> 40:25.660
yeah what's it was a continuous dv I have I have no idea um

40:28.220 --> 40:31.740
yeah we should think about I mean it's a neat it's a neat question I like I like these patches

40:31.740 --> 40:36.220
okay all right well thank you for that and again sorry for just meandering all over the place but

40:36.220 --> 40:38.940
Caroline you've you've you've you've you've saved my

40:41.260 --> 40:51.500
nonsensical rhetoric um so um yeah so we've got Selene for September uh I'm gonna have to spend

40:51.500 --> 40:54.300
I don't know how much time we're gonna have for this I'm very very interested and I understand

40:54.300 --> 40:58.940
times of the essence and if I'm being honest I think you're both right that like or I don't

40:58.940 --> 41:04.300
know if you're saying this but the sort of September is my best it's going to be September

41:04.300 --> 41:09.180
or December because when teaching starts for me at least it just just the teaching starts it just

41:09.180 --> 41:19.580
it's it's really really heavy um so what should we do next so I guess we press ahead with um if

41:19.580 --> 41:26.380
you are happy to direct Selene for these last two weeks and see how far we can get um and then

41:26.380 --> 41:34.380
we take stop and I can start drafting an article for modern slavery based on what we've got and then

41:34.380 --> 41:40.540
if we need to we come back to it in December I guess sorry we don't get it no I mean that's the

41:40.540 --> 41:46.940
the um reality of research and teaching I understand so for me I'm not teaching this semester I'm

41:46.940 --> 41:56.140
teaching spring semester so I will have time to do some drafting um so I suppose the question is

41:56.140 --> 42:03.740
how far can we get by then that's the concept of it isn't it okay for Dr. Moser I will send you that

42:03.740 --> 42:10.540
excellent spreadsheet that I shared earlier and what else is needed for that data clinic or anything

42:10.540 --> 42:16.060
else you should tell us to leave in the email if you want yeah well so one thing and this is going

42:16.060 --> 42:21.180
to be a judgment so I'll leave it to to the two of you is is picking the questions I think you're

42:21.260 --> 42:26.940
100% right Carolina I was making it too let's just pick five six questions that we think are

42:26.940 --> 42:34.060
indicators of uh you had the right you had a better phrase but what questions we want to add

42:34.060 --> 42:40.140
together to come up with this index or rank rank variable there's several that we could we'll need

42:40.140 --> 42:45.820
to make a decision so I'll leave that to you we've got you know there's for my memory it's and again

42:45.820 --> 42:51.980
kudos to you for the survey design it's it's everything from before I remember there's even

42:51.980 --> 42:56.460
like an explicit question like are you being exploited maybe it's not literally that exploited

42:56.460 --> 43:01.420
that explicit but then there's all these other you know have you been detained does your employer

43:01.420 --> 43:05.660
have your travel documents there's all these other questions so we'll need to pick some

43:06.300 --> 43:13.020
collection of those to to add together to make this this this risk indicator I don't know which

43:13.020 --> 43:19.020
questions those are I'll leave that to to to to you um Selim uh yes you and I will be in touch

43:19.020 --> 43:25.500
regarding the data um are you comfortable Selim doing the calculation so Caroline had this really

43:25.500 --> 43:33.340
good uh it was it was from several emails ago but uh uh sort of a step by step the protocol

43:33.340 --> 43:39.260
yeah the protocol what to calculate um once you tell me the data cleaning is good to go

43:39.980 --> 43:45.340
then I can stop doing it and I will face some challenge that's fine and I'll get back that's

43:45.340 --> 43:51.740
fine good good so in the in the short run then um we need to pick questions that indicate that you're

43:51.740 --> 43:57.820
in the hidden population questions plural and then we can try out these individual questions

43:57.820 --> 44:02.620
then we can also add them all together to get this risk index which I think is very cool and also

44:02.620 --> 44:09.900
very challenging um step two uh Selim you and I will have to work on this adjacency matrix

44:09.900 --> 44:15.980
that's only important for the bootstrapping which comes later so in the in the in the short run we

44:15.980 --> 44:23.100
can you Selim can start doing these calculations based on on Caroline's protocol uh and Selim

44:23.100 --> 44:29.820
you and I can can email on that and yeah let's push hard in September uh and uh

44:32.060 --> 44:37.580
and see see what we we can do I I believe for sure we can do the calculations we can do the

44:37.580 --> 44:43.500
calculations today I think um well once we have the questions sorted out uh the bootstrapping will

44:43.500 --> 44:48.220
take a little bit of work but it's relatively straightforward the risk and scale up is really

44:48.220 --> 44:56.060
interesting and in my mind sort of the step three down down the road I don't I don't really

44:56.060 --> 45:01.020
know I don't have a clear picture on how to how to do that just yet um but I I think I have a

45:02.620 --> 45:09.820
more focused uh idea of what's of what's happening I wish we had more time I'm really sorry everybody

45:09.820 --> 45:18.060
that uh yeah sorry no that's great we appreciate everybody's juggling various things and we got

45:18.060 --> 45:24.540
started the semester coming up there's a lot to think about so let me read this back to you

45:24.540 --> 45:31.980
so that I can check I've got this right so from I need to pick the five or six question combinations

45:32.940 --> 45:37.900
to produce a rank variable that would indicate somebody was at risk of being in the hidden

45:37.900 --> 45:47.900
population um Selim will start calculating uh the GSM formula that were identified in the protocol

45:49.180 --> 45:55.260
from our existing data set and you and Selim will you will help Selim

45:56.460 --> 46:00.860
send the data in preparation for bootstrapping and then I think you had another point which

46:01.420 --> 46:09.500
uh the the risk uh uh sort of that's on me or all of us to think about how to do scale up when

46:10.700 --> 46:17.340
the dependent variable isn't dichotomous so scale up is meant to estimate the size of a population but

46:18.460 --> 46:25.420
if we want to estimate the amount of risk in a population I don't it's not I don't I don't know

46:25.420 --> 46:30.780
how to do that um but but I we we can think about it and we can figure out a way to do it does that

46:30.780 --> 46:35.420
make sense I don't know if that makes sense yeah I think you just say yeah we don't know how to do

46:35.420 --> 46:42.380
this yet but we think it could be interesting yeah that's right so um yeah yeah I think for me that

46:42.380 --> 46:49.900
would be going back to the and then Selgin again trying to work out what their equations say about

46:49.900 --> 46:57.420
yeah they use yeah whether you're in this situation of labor exploitation exploitation or not

46:58.060 --> 47:06.220
versus yeah okay rather uh more of a spectrum exactly exactly you nailed it I mean the the

47:12.620 --> 47:17.260
there's sort of cheap ways to do it like so there's all these model based so if you guys

47:17.900 --> 47:22.380
the Laga paper I don't I can't remember who I've talked to about which papers

47:23.900 --> 47:33.580
anyway so the the the Feehan and Solnik again amazing but they sort of have these two approaches

47:33.580 --> 47:39.740
design based and model based and they seem to my my reading is they kind of favor the design

47:39.740 --> 47:44.060
based which is fine so that's like designing the sample and whatnot there's this whole other way of

47:44.060 --> 47:49.020
doing this kind of estimation that's model based where you just write down formulas and then you get

47:49.020 --> 47:56.540
a fast computer to do MCMC bays posteriors blah blah blah and so it's sort of the cheap way to

47:56.540 --> 48:02.220
do this is you just in the model based world you just replace a binomial distribution with a

48:02.220 --> 48:08.380
Poisson distribution and and you're off and running um this is all regards to this this risk

48:08.380 --> 48:14.540
business um uh forget I said any of that let me let me think on it I don't know I don't know how to

48:14.540 --> 48:18.940
do it I'm sure there's some way to do it but let me forget I said anything let me let me let me

48:18.940 --> 48:23.340
think on it and come back to you if you find it if you find any papers that will be useful for us to

48:23.340 --> 48:30.620
read as background Scott then do just log them across and I'll um if you if you find a come across

48:30.620 --> 48:39.420
anything and I'll also do this yes please I think the answer we'll see if we can find the answer

48:39.420 --> 48:45.980
perhaps in the literature or the gap in the literature but I suspect that's for me going

48:45.980 --> 48:52.140
beyond my methodological capability is certainly a present this is why collaborating is great this

48:52.140 --> 48:56.540
we all have we all have comparative advantages and I horrible at writing I don't know this

48:56.620 --> 49:02.220
the substance of this whatsoever so it's great to yeah this is this is why collaborating is great

49:02.220 --> 49:09.180
um okay so hopefully we've got a complementary set of skills and I mean if we find I know at the

49:09.180 --> 49:13.020
beginning you said you're not statistician but you obviously have a great deal more statistical

49:13.020 --> 49:19.900
knowledge than I do but if you do feel that we need somebody else then I mean let me know and

49:20.700 --> 49:25.100
we can try and recruit somebody because there was another guy who made contact with me

49:25.820 --> 49:31.340
I said he was interested in this I think it's um David Murphy do you know David

49:32.780 --> 49:37.660
no so I just said it was something we were working on at the moment but I can have a look

49:37.660 --> 49:44.860
to see if we need to expand the team then we can do that too I think okay let's let's let's like you

49:44.860 --> 49:52.140
said present yeah I think I mean you've just been your advice has been invaluable so I think we

49:52.220 --> 49:58.860
we press on I agreed I agreed let's see I think you're on the same page let's let's let's do a

49:58.860 --> 50:06.460
hard push in September and see how far we get and um Selene you and I will be emailing a lot

50:06.460 --> 50:14.780
in the next two weeks um right that's perfect okay I think go ahead I've maybe making some

50:14.780 --> 50:19.260
notes just to capture what we've said um I'll tidy those up and then I'll email them around

50:19.260 --> 50:23.660
everybody say that we've got another marker in the sand about just just trying to capture the

50:23.660 --> 50:29.260
discussions really sounds great yeah thanks so much and uh it's very it's very cool I'm

50:30.060 --> 50:33.100
especially this next stage I'm actually very very excited about because this is like

50:33.980 --> 50:37.580
this is where we start learning stuff this is where we like actually get anyway I'm I'm very

50:37.580 --> 50:45.500
excited so let's let's uh thank you again thank you again right that's cool right fantastic thank

50:45.500 --> 50:51.740
thank you all uh we'll be in touch thanks very much take care bye

51:15.500 --> 51:21.740
okay

52:45.500 --> 52:52.500
Thank you very much.
