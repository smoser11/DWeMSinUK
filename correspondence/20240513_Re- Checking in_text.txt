Dear Caroline,

 

Thank you for your email!  I am sorry for not replying sooner.  Easter break was quite nice, and I’m very happy that lecturing has just wrapped up for me!  I am getting back to research (before the flood of marking starts!) and this is number two on my ‘list.’  I’m afraid I need to spend some time to get back into it, as I’ve forgotten where I/we were at.  I remember when I last worked on this there was a non-trivial technical issue I was having with some of the bootstrapping. I have an idea of how to resolve this problem, but haven’t implemented it yet.

Last I remember we were waiting on me (scott) to perform both the RDS estimation and also the NSUM estimation.  Oh!  I just remembered there was an issue with the questions – as in how to ‘properly’ compare the RDS estimates to the NSUM estimates, as the former is ‘egocentric’ and the latter is not.

I agree that we should push on this and get it ‘out the door’ as soon as we can.

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

Hope that you had a good Easter break. Just checking in to see how things are going with you? I finish teaching at the end of this week, and then have a brief respite before examination marking at the beginning of June. This is a window of opportunity if there is more that I can do my end to progress our BJM paper.

 

Best wishes

Caroline
