Happy to share - but I asked Selim to record his bibliographies in Word - I am sorry if this makes me seem like a dinosaur üôÅ Let me know if these documents would be any good for you?

PS.  Sorry if this is a bother, or nosey, or both, but do you mind sharing your bibliography Caroline?  That is, if you use Zotero, or Mendely or EndNote or anything else, it would help me to 'ingest' the references you cite.  Thanks!

Subject: First draft of our RDS paper 
 
Hi Scott and Selim,

I have attached here a first draft of our RDS inspired paper. RDS paper draft 24-11-2023.docx

This is not perfect, by any means, - it really is my first draft -  but hopefully  it gives us something to edit polish and refine as we insert and position the RDS calculations. Selim - as you will see I have drawn heavily on your excellent annotated bibliographies. 

I hope that you are still able and willing to provide the detail for the additional - primarily methods, analysis and discussion- sections that I have indicated within this draft. Do please both feel free to correct any inaccuracies that I have introduced into the parts of the method and to expand on that which I have drafted.

I think we do have a meeting in the diary already, so hopefully you both have time at least to review the paper before we meet and we can then discuss the suggested additions/ overall direction.

I hope that you both have a fantastic weekend

Best wishes
Caroline
