Hi Scott,

Hope that you had/ are having a good Easter break. I've looked back at the NRM figures again  - and to me my snap Good Friday still email does seem to me to explain the difference-  are you happy with us using the cumulative figure rather than one annual total of positive grounds decisions?

I have some time this week (before I'm on leave again until the beginning of the summer semester) to amalgamate the two article drafts I've written into one cohesive wrapper for your statistical analysis targeted at the British Journal of Management. 

To pick up the thread from where our previous discussion left off, I know that our methodology may not be novel in statistical terms, but since I could not find any mention of RDS or NSUM within a journal article search of BJM I do think that is it claimable as new to the Management literature so shall work on positioning our contribution in this way. Does this sound OK to you?

Best wishes
Caroline

Hi Scott,

Yes indeed - A Happy Easter to you too.

The NRM figure I gave you is a cummulative total 'since records began, rather than the annual figure. Does this explain the discrepancy?

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

We made it!  To Easter break!  Huzzah!  I still have marking, but at least teaching is winding down.

I was tidying my browser and found this

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2020/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2020

 

which has NRM refereals for 202 at about 10K, not the 70+k Iâ€™ve been using.  Can you help me square this?

Happy Easater!

Scott
