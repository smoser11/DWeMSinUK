Hi Scott,

Firstly, I shall be eternally grateful to you for persisting with this. I greatly appreciate your insight. This project does not stand or fall by the use of a particular statistical technique which, if I understand your email correctly, is fortunate since our attempts to  use Feehan and Salganik's protocol seems to force us into making statistical assumptions about the relationship between our sample and its frame that we cannot justify.

I am sorry that I am not so familiar with the terminology that you have used, so I am not able to comment with any confidence  whether 'we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$.' If you are able to clarify this, then we can perhaps direct Selim with more confidence. 

 As far as I am concerned the big prize is a statistical viable population estimate - by a means that our data will support.

However, I am very pleased that you do seem to indicate that we might be able to proceed with a RDS/NSUM approach - this would seem to be very good news-  although I do recognise that in doing this, we would have to live with the drawbacks of the NSUM which again makes certain problematic assumptions (as detailed by Feehan and Salganik 2016). I also am glad that you think we do have ARD - if not enriched ARD.

The 'stop- start' process does not make this any easier as it is difficult to keep the technical detail of these procedures in one's head. Do you think that we could perhaps arrange an in-person Friday session (1/2 or full day?) for us to try and work through this between us - or, might another approach suit you better?

Unfortunately, I am in Portsmouth for a workshop this Friday, but I could clear my diary on 3 November if you think trying to work this through in a longer in-person session might be more efficient?

Best wishes
Caroline

Many thanks to all.  I'm afraid I write with some bad news.  But not as bad as I had earlier thought.  I have spend the afternoon (re-)wrapping my head around things, and reflecting on our meeting yesterday.  Today my approach was to (1) look for replication studies using NSUM/ GNSUM (2) look at the literature citing the original F&G 2016 paper and (3) start to look into alternative estimators, specifically look into papers that user RDS and NSUM to estimate the size of hidden populations.



### The bad news ###

I understand the Exploratory Protocol to be the steps to arrive at the estimate for the size of the hidden population using eqn. 23 of F&S (2016).  The 'innovation' of what they call the 'modified basic scale-up estimator'  is two fold:  First they use the average degree size of everyone in F to everyone in F (this makes sense);  then they use the size of the sample frame ($N_F$) rather than the total population size ($N$ in eqn. 22).  Specifically, in the right-most fraction.  That is the issue we discussed yesterday regarding the order in which the divisions were taken.  But technically speaking, that is incorrect.  I've tried to 'slice' this quantity in a number of ways, but I think we need the size of the sample frame, $N_F$, in any event.  And I really hope I am wrong!

To wit, the denominator of the right-most fraction of eqn. 23 involves _the size of the frame, F_.  Which we do not have.  Actually, it is worse than that, because we definitely to not have $\hat{d}_{F,F}$.  Now, I _think_ -- but do not know -- that what the Protocol it trying to do is to estimate these quantities from the sample ($s_F$).  I don't know if that is OK or not.  I would be more convinced if we knew s_F was a representative sample from F.  But I think this issue was discussed yesterday.

Alternatively, we can try to estimate the average degree from F to F (called $\hat{d}_{F,F}$) using the formula in the bottom-center 'orb' of Figure 4.  This is the 'known population scale-up' I was talking about yesterday.  I tried to dig deeper: $N_{\mathcal{A}}$ is the total size of all the 'probe alter' groups (aka 'pivot groups' or PG).  For use, we have one: the size of those that have gone through the NRM.  From page 161, this group (for us, in general _these_ groups) must belong to the sample frame, F.  So:
1.If we are going to use the known group-size to calculate the average personal degree size, then I think we need to assume that everyone that has gone through the NRM is part of the sample frame.  Is this true?  I very much doubt it, but again, I really hope I am wrong!
2.In the application(s) of GNSUM I've seen, specifically the following
Jing, L., Qu, C., Yu, H., Wang, T., & Cui, Y. (2014). Estimating the sizes of populations at high risk for HIV: A comparison study. PloS One, 9(4), e95601. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095601
they take a random sample from the population (frame in our case) and an RDS/ Vincent link tracing sample from the hidden population.  I understand we dont' have the latter, but I don't think we have the former, either (?).
2a.  I *think * have some replication materials from some NSUM/ GNSUM published studies.   Perhaps even the Jing et al.  I have simply forgotten since I last looked at this in depth in the spring.

I looked for any paper using their 'modified basic scale-up estimator' (eqn 23) but I couldn't find any. üôÅ


### Now for the not-so bad news ###

If we think/ can argue that $s_F$ is representative of $F$, then I could see a case for the approach that Selim is currently coding up being useful.


### Now for the good news ###

The structure of the data is exactly a "RDS with ARD data collected from the sample frame of DW in the UK who have a mobile phone."  And there are loads of papers that deal with this type of data:

[RDS and measurements of a 'hidden population' papers]

I am only peripherally knowledgeable about RDS and inference.  And not at all about NSUM and RDS.  but it is out there, and we can try them out (?)


---

On my end, the 'start and stop' of research is _really_ inefficient.  And has shown to introduce errors.  So, my preference is to get this done asap, if we are going to get it done that is.

I hope we can chat further.  
Best,
scott

Thanks for moving us on, Scott. Here is the record of what we discussed which I shall attempt to synthesis into the beginnings of a draft over the next week or so.

Best wishes
Caroline
