Hi Scott,

Thanks for your perseverance with cleaning the data. I'm happy with DWinUK either with or without the +EE. I hope that Selim may be in a position to deal with your codebook and detailed coding queries?

Best wishes
Caroline

Subject: DWinUK data 
 
Dear both,
Thank you for a wonderful – and mind-expanding – meeting on Friday!  I hope you have enjoyed your respective weekends. 

Some scattered thoughts: (1) is there an acronym I should be using in meials to refer to this paper?  I'm thinking 'DWinUK' (= domestic workers in the UK) or perhaps with a 'experiencing exploitation' (+EE?)

(2) What I thought would be an two-hour side project has turned into a bit of a small creature, regarding the data we are using. 
I am trying to 'clean' the data, specifically adjust the 'personal network size' (q13) in light of the number of referrals a person made, as we discussed on Friday.   Turns out I have loads more questions about the data (sorry, Selim!).  To wit, please consider the attached file, `DWinUK_data.csv`, which is exactly the  file `Further Coding Update.xlsx` just with 'clean'variable names.  I am confused about the way the questions are recorded as variables.  For example, I originally thought that​ (A) the variables q105​ to q110​ contained the (up-to) five referrals (the 'coupons' in RDS language).  However, upon closer inspection, it seems that (B ) perhaps the variables q105​ to q115​ might contain the mobile numbers of referals (see ID 13, row 11 in the CSV file).  HOWEVER, however, (C)  ID 14 (row 12) seems to thwart this interpretation, because this person seems to have nominated three other DWs (
7575744493
7309055303
7366528118
in vars q105, q106, q107 respectively), but then there is also a mobile number in q115 (mobile = 7823598150).  So, did this person nominate three people?  Or four?

If interpretation (B ) is correct, then subjects could nominate up to 10 others, not five as I had been thinking.  Please help clarify.  Also also, there are two codebooks (attached) – which should I be using? 
Thanks, I am looking forward to making headway on this.
