Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour

Hi Scott,

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 



I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 



Best wishes

Caroline
