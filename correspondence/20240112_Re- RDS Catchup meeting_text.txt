That's excellent Selim, thank you. I shall read your additions. I suggest that Scott and I meet up as planned on Monday, but that we schedule our next meeting at a time that is convenient for you too.

I'll send a further meeting request once we have an agreed date and time.

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline, 

Thank you for your email.

I have some updates regarding the paper. I will be in Germany next week, so I will not be able to attend the meeting on Monday. Alternatively, I can meet on the 25th or 26th of January again.

Please see attached the updated paper draft, I have added an updated graph with some writing in the section of the network. In the new graph, I have indicated respondents from each wave for clarity. I hope you like it, and please let me know if you want me to add anything else.

In the meantime, I have noted down a task to check the high estimates of modern slavery. I think the descriptive statistics show a similarly high percentage of exploitation among respondents. I have listed some examples of questions in the attachment.

Thank you, and please let me know what you think.

With kind regards,

Selim Yilmaz

Sorry to hear about the IT failure. Yes I can do Monday at 11. I'll send through a teams link. 

Selim, I hope that you too can join us?

Best wishes - and a Happy New Year to you both

Dear Caroline,

Please don't hate me, but can we postpone our RDS catchup meeting scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) am, please?  I have been working on it, and have essentially 'caught myself' up from our past meetings.  I have also managed to suffer a bad IT failure and currently cannot locate the  estimations and work preformed last term.  so sorry!

How is your monday?  11am?

Stay warm and happy 2024!
scott
