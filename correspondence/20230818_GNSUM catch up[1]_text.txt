Subject: GNSUM catch up

Hi Scott,

My apologies for the delay in sending through a definitive time for this meeting. I hope that 11-12 am may still be convenient for you, but if not do please suggest an earlier time in the morning. I have suggested that we go for a remote meeting this time.

If you could come prepared with any queries related to the protocol that have arisen from your reading of the literature that would be superb.

Have a great weekend - and I look forward to catching up with you on Monday.
