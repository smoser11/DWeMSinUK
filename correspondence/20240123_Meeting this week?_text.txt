Subject: Meeting this week?

Hi Scott, 

I am half-way through listening to your videos. I note already that the clarity you provide about separating out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk mean that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

I hear also that you are making good progress  working out technically how we may be able to use the RDS/convenience sample to estimate the size of the domestic worker population. I don't exactly follow this, but what you've said seems to sound promising.

I know that you suggested meeting up either Thurs 25 or Fri 26th. Selim, could you please indicate your availability so that Scott can pick a suitable time (I am available anytime except between 2-3 on Thursday or 4-5 on Friday).

I'll see if I can listen to the second video now.

Best wishes
Caroline
