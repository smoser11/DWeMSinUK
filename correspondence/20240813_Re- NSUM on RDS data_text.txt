Subject: Re: NSUM on RDS data

Hi Scott,

In response to the specific points that you raise, please see my initial thoughts in yellow below:

1.There were two technical issues I was having with the analysis of your data: one about RDS bootstraps and one about NSUM.  Iâ€™ve looked into he former, emailed the author, interrogated their code (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Neighboot/index.html), and have to give up.  BUT! I have a second approach in mind, which I just started.  So, Iâ€™m keeping the faith ðŸ˜Š  The second I havenâ€™t worked on much, but will do so. 

That is such a pity - the bootstrapping seemed really helpful. I admire you persistence and wish you every success with the second approach. Thank you very much for persevering.
1a.I donâ€™t know where we left things,  BUT: I have extensive notes and emails.  So Iâ€™m hoping once the analysis is done (my bad) we should be close.  
I have tried to capture the essence of our methodological conversations in the paper draft for BJM's methodological corner. Whether on not this is the right outlet, I don't know, but hopefully we can build on my interpretation of what you have explained methodologically and get a good paper out of it. Please let me know if you would like me to resend the draft as it currently stands.
Last I remember there was an issue comparing RDS questions to NSUM questions on the survey (?)
I'm not sure that I have captured this issue anywhere. If you have time to record a video stream I could try to write it up for us and add it to the paper?
1b.I *think* the third issue holding us up was something about comparing NSUM estimates to RDS estimates and the question of which survey questions to use. 

Again, I am not sure that currently I have captured this issue. If this works for you, perhaps you could record your thoughts? I thought that this worked very well last time you did it. 
 Does that ring any bells?  I have a vague memory of some questionsion about self/others matching up, but others not.  
Yes - I do remember you speaking about this. It was to do with some respondents saying that they knew no one who was in a certain situation type and then also listing contact numbers at the end. We decided, I think, to increase the null value to show that instead that they were in contact with at least the number of people whose contact numbers they had indicated. Perhaps this is what you mean by the statement below?
But that in the later case we could aggregate some questions to obtain comparability(??)
 
2.I want to pick your brain about your domestic worker  (DW) data if you can.  What survey form did you use? I can't remember now. It used to be called the Bristol On Line Survey - but I believe that it has changed its name  If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently? I would do what you've done and read the papers more thoroughly to start with! In particular ask supplementary questions of those identified as part of the hidden population - we had these contacts, but didn't approach them directly and therefore missed out on some valuable data that would have helped with the NSUM calculation.
3. I ask for a number of reasons but primarily b/c Iâ€™m working on  a grant bid to Nuffield.  I still have a lot of work (I havenâ€™t even picked a â€˜populationâ€™ e.g. DWs, construction workers, agricultural workers).  Are you interested in being part of the grant?  That is very kind of you Scott - if you think that my experience could be of help, then I would be happy to be part of the grant. I work mostly on modern slavery among domestic  care workers so - if it is indeed part of the population that you end up considering, I would be happy to be involved. I think your experience would help the project considerably.
 
Iâ€™ll be on the (far) west coast of the US for about a week.  Feel free to email, but I donâ€™t know how timely my replies will be until I return to Nottingham. Have a great time! And speak to you when you return

Best wishes

Dear Scott,

I hope that your travel plans have gone well. And thank you for taking the time to email me. My recollection of the project is rather dim and I would need to reread the emails that we exchanged before I could usefully reply to your questions. I shall re-read the thread and come back to you as soon as I can. 

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I am so very sorry for not being in touch sooner!  This project has indeed moved to the top of my â€˜to doâ€™ list.  But I am furiously packing and leaving on a flight at 8am tomorrow.  I had hoped to send you a thorough email of where (I think) we are, and what is next.  Alas, I havenâ€™t made it.  Here is what I have at the momentâ€¦. Sorry.

 

 

!  I hope you are enjoying your summer.  Mine is coming to an end far too quickly.  I have several things on my mind, so apologies for the long email (if a Teams meeting would be better, Iâ€™m happy to do so).

 

1.There were two technical issues I was having with the analysis of your data: one about RDS bootstraps and one about NSUM.

I am still optimistic I can make sufficient progress on this in August.

 

By the way: thank you for being a wonderful co-author!  Not all of mine are at the moment, so thank you for your kind patience.

 

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I hope that the R&R is now put to bed and that you have been able to make some headway with the intransigent RDS/NSUM issue.

 

As I said, I am taking some annual leave - returning 18 July. If I don't hear from you in the meantime, I'll drop you a line when I return.

 

Really looking forward to seeing all the work that you've done on this come together. I so appreciate your support and expertise with this.

 

Best wishes for a good summer,

 

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I hope you are enjoying your summer!  I have *not* forgotten about our paper, and have â€˜poked at itâ€™ a little in the past few weeks.  I have an R&R deadline I need to address first, and Iâ€™m out of town most of next week.  If you donâ€™t hear back from me by Friday next, may I please invite you to â€˜pingâ€™ me?  Oddly, I still have not resolved the â€˜minor technicalâ€™ issue I was having ages ago.

 

I am excited to finish this off, see the results and get is polished!  Thank you again for working with me ðŸ˜Š

Best,

Scott
