Dear Scott,

Thanks for sparing us your valuable time this morning. I have made some notes and pointers based on our discussion. Selim and I will commence with the data cleaning and a suggested operationalisation of the 'how many do I know in Hn' questions and hope to come back to you presently.


I note from your comments that,
Equation 23 v equation 24 of F&S 2016 are primarily of interest to us
in essence, what we have is best presented as a convenience sample of people from the UK who have been employed as a domestic worker who have a cell phone number and have been employed in domestic work in the past 12 months
There may be some data problems in the way that that questions that have the potential to skew the data e.g.'How many x do you know' has been specified to refer only to those with cell phones (this was done to reduce the risk of recall error)
There may be some definitional issues - related to the multiple ways in which labour exploitation has been operationalised (it may be possible to group these questions to provide different lens e.g.  forced labour v less severe forms of labour abuse which could be interesting, with different robustness levels)
More substantive issues may exist in relation to the size of the social network
Given the data, it is not possible to calculate a frame ratio (although one approach suggested by F&S would suggest that this is not needed) or, due to the lack of enriched aggregated data, the true positive rate (although I must admit that I still need to look at this again to understand this problem) 
There is only one probe alter for domestic workers- 5-20 are more common
Positively
Bootstrapping is the way to go - which you can help us with 
We have the average degree from the hidden group to the frame so the data exists to calculate the degree ratio - to 95 CI  - can cite those who say this is of interest  - what is needed now is a justification for the practical usefulness of this adjustment factor
The data is richer than is common for SU studies, with the option to explore multiple forms of H
These can be run through with robust sensitivity checks - which you can help us with too
F&S 2016 identify 5 different GNSUM estimates - which one to choose is an interesting question
Micro household sampling is nice
F and U and clear and coherent
Data cleaning
Separation of text and numbers e.g. Q1 of 2 seems to have both
Logical inconsistencies e.g. Q85 and Q86 - Q86 must be no larger than Q85 (follow logic to maximise data)
Phone numbers entered where count expected (need to be converted
Remove or explain apparent repetition e.g. Q83 and Q88
I hope that I have covered all the substantive issues that we covered. Enjoy your holiday

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline and Selim,

 

Many thanks for this.  I’ve been (re-)reading up on this today and think I have my head around it.  Attached are just a few thoughts, questions.  I’ll have many for (of both!) tomorrow.  My main question at this point is about sampling. Are there sampling weights?  What were the Primary Sampling Units (PSU)?

 

Looking forward to chatting,

Scott

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline, 

 

Thank you for your email. 

 

In preparation for the meeting tomorrow, I am attaching the sample data and codebook as I cannot upload them to the OneDrive folder that Dr Moser shared. I hope this will facilitate the discussion on GNSUM analysis. 

 

I look forward to meeting you both. 

 

Thank you. 

 

With kind regards, 

 

Selim Yilmaz

Hi Scott,

 

Tuesday at 11 is fine for me. I have edited the meeting link accordingly. I think your outlook may be automatically declining new invitations, so do please let me know if you need be to forward the link to you some other way.

 

Selim, could you please export the data from our JISC survey so that Scott can take a look?

 

Thanks again for accommodating us, Scott. I really appreciate it

 

Best wishes

Caroline
