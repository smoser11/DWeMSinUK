Subject: Updated protocol

Hi Scott and Selim,

Thank you for the work that you have done on this over the weekend, Scott - and for sending me another link your annotations of the protocol document. I've now had another look at this and added further annotations to your observations. I hope that what is now described here may allow Selim to calculate point estimates for two respondent samples: a) all valid responses from domestic workers working in the UK (which we then compare to the most recent overall ODW visa numbers: noting the provisos about the visa categories that we have already discussed) and b) a sub-sample of filipino- only respondents (for which using an ODW visa estimate may be more realistic of the actual situation. These are described further in the shared document: Exploratory protocol based upon Feehan and Salganik (2016)SJM - CE.docx

I have also now included the probe alter calculation based upon the number of NRM referrals suggested by Scott - although I am not yet clear what further calculations we use this for.

So, what I think is happening now: Scott - teaching permitting, you are guiding Selim on data cleansing and bootstrapping the variance estimation (can this also be done for the two different samples, a and b)?

While Selim and I will work through point estimates for samples a) and b). Selim, if you can take a look at the revised attachment, we can discuss any issues in our routine meeting before the BEP team meeting tomorrow.

I hope that I have accurately reflected our earlier discussions here now.

Best wishes
Caroline
