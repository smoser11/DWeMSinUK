Subject: Fw: EU data on domestic workers 2018

Hi Scott,

Here is a copy of the email with the number of domestic workers figure - it comes to around 1 million (or more accurately 980,000 see calculation below). I think that the 73,000 figure referred to the cumulative NRM numbers and so is no longer of interest to us.

Hope this helps 
Caroline

Hi Scott,

I have been trying to pin this down in advance of our meeting, and have found the following (useful?) source: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1427&langId=en

In EU parlance, domestic workers are part of the Personal and  Household Service sector (PHS) made up of 'social work within accommodation' (NACE 88) and 'activities of households as employers of domestic personnel' (NACE 97/ SIC 97)

In an 2018 thematic review, the EU estimated the number of NACE 88 workers in the UK at 929,000 and NACE 97 workers at 51,000 (Q3, 2017). (Figure I, p.13 in the attached file).

Would this give us reasonable grounds for an estimate of circa 1 million?

Best wishes 
Caroline
