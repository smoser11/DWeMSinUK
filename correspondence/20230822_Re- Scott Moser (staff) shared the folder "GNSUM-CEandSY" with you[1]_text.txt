Hi Scott,

I've taken a brief look at the definitions of sampling weights and primary sample units. 

My initial thoughts are that, should we need to, we can estimate a sampling weight (as the number of individuals in the population each respondent in the sample is representing) based upon either a breakdown of the number of ODWs from each migrant community granted a visa compared with the number of respondents from that community in our sample. This would be likely to result in some residual respondents from communities that may not be represented in official statistics. Or we could take a more holistic view and describe the sampling weight of the total respondent set (90+ responses) across the ODW population as a whole 18,000+ 

In terms of primary sampling units - we asked NGO partners from organisations that represented either domestic workers in the UK or specialist community groups (Latin American Women and the Filipino community) to identify domestic worker seeds for us. So perhaps our primary sampling unit (the sampling unit chosen in the first stage of selection) is the domestic worker?

Look forward to discussing this with you further
Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline and Selim,

 

Many thanks for this.  I’ve been (re-)reading up on this today and think I have my head around it.  Attached are just a few thoughts, questions.  I’ll have many for (of both!) tomorrow.  My main question at this point is about sampling. Are there sampling weights?  What were the Primary Sampling Units (PSU)?

 

Looking forward to chatting,

Scott

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline, 

 

Thank you for your email. 

 

In preparation for the meeting tomorrow, I am attaching the sample data and codebook as I cannot upload them to the OneDrive folder that Dr Moser shared. I hope this will facilitate the discussion on GNSUM analysis. 

 

I look forward to meeting you both. 

 

Thank you. 

 

With kind regards, 

 

Selim Yilmaz

Hi Scott,

 

Tuesday at 11 is fine for me. I have edited the meeting link accordingly. I think your outlook may be automatically declining new invitations, so do please let me know if you need be to forward the link to you some other way.

 

Selim, could you please export the data from our JISC survey so that Scott can take a look?

 

Thanks again for accommodating us, Scott. I really appreciate it

 

Best wishes

Caroline
