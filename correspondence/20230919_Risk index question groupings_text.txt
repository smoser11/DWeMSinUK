Subject: Risk index question groupings

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have now been through the codebook and identified those questions that identify the respondent as a member of the hidden population of those at risk of forced labour. All 11 indicators are covered with the risk of forced labour increasing with the presence of more than one indicator. Questions that identify respondent as a member of the hidden population.docx

Scott - I hope that this is more what you had in mind? 

My next job is to revisit your comments related to the protocol. Would it be possible perhaps to give me access to review the latest version of the protocol document in the shared file so that I can add my comments as track changes?

Best wishes
Caroline
