Hi Scott,

Selim and I have been finalising an interim report from the research, which has been published today and which I attach here for your information. Now that this is out of the way, I am hoping that we can make some progress on the point estimates. Selim, are you able to update us on whether you need any further help with estimating these?

I do have a small amount of my NRF budget which can be used this financial year to fund further RA support should we need it.

Best wishes
Caroline

I haven't forgotten about out research project(s), but teaching has started and it is my heaviest term so far.  But I've managed to carve out all of Friday as a 'research day.'  So I very much expect to work on our project(s) this term.  Just FYI.
How are things?  What/when can I help+contribute?

Stay healthy,
scott
