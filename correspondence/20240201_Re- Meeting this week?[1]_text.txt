Hi Selim

Shall we split the meeting then? Selim and I can meet on Friday at 2pm? I think Scott is available at 1, so he and I can speak then and I can brief Selim. Would this work for everyone? I'll send through two meeting links-  - just accept the one that is the most convenient

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline,

Thank you for your email.

To follow up on your proposed change, Dr Moser, I can meet with you this Friday before 12 PM and after 2 PM. I hope we can find a time that works for all of us. 

Generally speaking, I cannot meet on Mondays or Thursdays for this semester.

Thank you.

With kind regards,

Selim Yilmaz

Howdy all!  I'm super excited about this research and meeting!  And my marking is finally starting to subside.  However, I have UG diss advising this Friday from 11am to 1pm.  I'll be on campus, and so can meet at 1pm on Friday or on Teams any time on Monday.
Looking forward to it!
scott

Yes, I agree re: first week of teaching stresses.  I'll be on campus this Friday if you want.  Or Teams is always fine for me.
Looking forward to progression with you all!

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline,

Thank you for your email, and I apologise for the delay in my reply.

I am available anytime except Mondays and Thursdays starting next week. At the moment, I am overloaded with marking and preparing the delivery of a lecture. Please let me know when you have arranged to meet next and I will join the conversation.

In the meantime, please update me if there is anything else that I could help with.

Thank you.

With kind regards,

Selim Yilmaz

Hi Scott, 

I am half-way through listening to your videos. I note already that the clarity you provide about separating out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk mean that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

I hear also that you are making good progress  working out technically how we may be able to use the RDS/convenience sample to estimate the size of the domestic worker population. I don't exactly follow this, but what you've said seems to sound promising.

I know that you suggested meeting up either Thurs 25 or Fri 26th. Selim, could you please indicate your availability so that Scott can pick a suitable time (I am available anytime except between 2-3 on Thursday or 4-5 on Friday).

I'll see if I can listen to the second video now.

Best wishes
Caroline
