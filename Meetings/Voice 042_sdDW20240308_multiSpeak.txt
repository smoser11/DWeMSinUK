Speaker 1 

Very quick. 

Speaker 2 

Good, good. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Hi. 

Speaker 2 

Hi. Hi, everyone. So I guess just a quick. Update on my end, so I've been. Things are coming along. Things are. Things are. Coming along, it's just. I just need a lot of. Electrons. So I just. Have these just. Big, Big runs is is what's going on right now. So I have a preferred model and then I have like 50, you know, alternative models for robustness. We'll shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all the electrons. So that's sort of chugging along. 

Speaker 

I'm. 

Speaker 2 

Almost done, but haven't finished implementing the the the Feehan and Saul Solnik. 

Speaker 3 

I'm going to, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

The the, the the Insum the insum. So I'm I'm almost done with that, the. I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to relearn it. There's so I'm I'm doing that. And then when I do that, then we'll. Get an estimate and do the bootstraps and that's I think that'll be. That'll be pretty. There's one weird thing about the data that I discovered. There's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry. Before I did there, I did subset it by just the the people who identified as Philippine. Oh, and the estimates are about the same. 

Speaker 3 

Oh yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Slightly higher it's something like 47% depending on how you measure exploitation. So but they're about the same but slightly higher. And I haven't done anything else on that the data so. There are two weird sources of of errors. The one is, is these these true zeroes? Remember we talked about from a while ago so people could say that they don't know any but. OK, sorry. Two other things. I should make. Note to myself so I can pop size. 

Speaker 3 

You want to record it, Scott? 

Speaker 2 

It's OK. I'm I I take furious notes, but. 

Speaker 3 

You've recorded it somewhere, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But you, you. You feel? I don't know. Please feel free to if you want to the. Pop size. Oh, so you could people have reported that they know zero. Domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone so that that's we fixed that up that's fine. And then there was another one which is really weird which is where they. The number of people they reported knowing Q13, I'm pretty sure is the one I I know these things are stuck in my head now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than. The the the number of people they recruit. Where recruiting is determined by the node one node 2 the the the the the the network structure. So that's really weird. I I that one took me a while to sort of and the two people but those two people really, really messed me up so so I fixed that. So so now we have a new. Personal degree size, which is the Max of all of those. So it's it's the Max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the number of people that you recruit as given by the the network structure. And like I said the the last one was from a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not, I'm not super worried about it and we have these things we have these suspicious. This variable so we can we can what I'm trying to say is like we can we can remove the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat and that's that's that's fine. OK so that's that implementing the free hand and so so that's just electricity at this point like it's just it's it's done and and again the the. Estimates are very, very consistent. Between 30 and 40%, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me that's shockingly high. But it's it's very consistent. So in some I'm I'm working on the bootstrap is working and I'm almost done with the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff, so we need this the size of the frame. So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year. We needed that for the the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that the the preferred number. Thanks to you Caroline with 980,000 I think something like that came from. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And again I've I've. Standed out I I I use. I use sample frame sizes from 10/10 thousand 100,009 to 980 thousand 1.5 million just again for robustness I should probably add because I think one of the I don't know what it was called. I threw it down the there are these two occupational. Classes that you used Caroline from and, and one of them was like spot on and then the other one was. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Was plausible, but So what I'm trying to say I should I should use. So currently the preferred model uses the sum of those two numbers, but I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Think so too? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I I should and that's fine. I'm happy to report that everything. But again for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated whatever, so that's that's. That's what I do now. The pro bolsters, so we need to know this. We only have one, and that's the number of people you know who have been referred to the national referral mechanism or whatever it's called in our in our. So we have that question. And we thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people. In the UK, like we, we know the size. Of that group. And so I'm trying rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame which we needed from before, and there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the end sum, we also need the size of these pro bolter groups, so I'd I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. It just sort of just sort of adds. Some complexity to it adds noise really to these estimators, so I haven't done that. There's gonna be more electrons, more electrons to use. So the right pro Balter group that was the other pop size, and I told you about the weird this thing with the people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry. Don't know how to count. And that's where I'm at. So sorry I didn't I. Again, I'm sorry I was. Coding furiously, hoping I could get it done before 3. But then I I. I thought I I didn't know how to read my calendar, so sorry about that. So. So that's where the update on my end date is. 

Speaker 3 

I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress and I there's a question is what do you need from us? 

Speaker 2 

So I think I think we're we're good to. Electrons. That's fine, I think. I think we're ready for uh. Then you discussing where we want to submit it and slim were we able to did the Zotero references work for you? I don't know. I sent one good. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So I'm trying to say I think I think we're we're into like once all my batches running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you know, writing up the results. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that works fine. It works. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Inclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. OK, that sounds fantastic. So in terms of journal targets and then the question is. I suppose within the Business School, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list the it's like an association of business schools journal quality list with the the school. 

Speaker 2 

With ABS, sorry maintenance. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Signed up to the Dora principles, that it's not all about journal destination, but it is a a factor, so one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal targets. Is that list. OK. Well I tend to publish anywhere that so I have not really been following the rules very strictly and and I don't know what. Your publication targets might look like and so I'm quite happy to be ecumenical about this and not necessarily pick a journal off that list just because that's what you're supposed to do. But but having said that. There is one journal potentially, which is a three star Journal, so it's not absolutely top quality, but it's reputable called work, employment and society. 

Speaker 2 

Work with them in society, OK? 

Speaker 3 

Which has a strong theoretical basis. So I I don't know whether well that would mean that I would need to do some background work on. They definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's it's sort of sociologically focused. And and the advantage is one of the editor in chief is actually marrick causes. Who is? Yeah, who's obviously at the Business School. So I could sound him out and just say would you accept her? Sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated paper in the domestic works? 

Speaker 2 

I got them, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Is that something that you think might fall within the scope of the journal? So that that was the target that sort of occurred to me. But I'm very open to publishing where it would suit you, Scott. 

Speaker 2 

I mean I I think the ABS list is a great place to start because I know nothing about this this field at at all. But it sounds like, I mean, yeah, more more stars is better in general for for for me, but but at the same time like I'm not like you, Caroline. Like I'm not. I'm not picky about these things. But you know. My general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down to yours as the rejection letter just come in, which in my case they they fill up my mailbox so that would be yeah. So I mean ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Appropriate for, you know, labor domestic work. You pay human rights, whatever and start there and yeah, and work our way down would be I guess one other thing I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important is. So the strategy I. Just. Articulated is. Is A is a lengthy process so. So I guess we should talk about timeline. Are there are people going for promotion or jobs or other are there are is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or? 

Speaker 3 

I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know how does that sound for you. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Again, I'm. I'm. I'm, I'm. I'm OK taking time and doing the the start high. And when's the next do we know when the rough cycle ends? I don't I don't know when is it. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's REF 2029 now, but when the actual. Not ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline is for paper submissions is I don't know. But I mean 24, we're we've got a few. We've got enough time to try a higher journal. Yeah. And then knock down to it. So I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars if you think we'd like to start with that. 

Speaker 2 

That would be my preference if that's. If if there's. 

Speaker 3 

Right. OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that would be my preference. I I like like you. I don't. I don't have time constraints. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Well, I mean, there's somewhere like the British Journal of. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view, a bit of a quantitative bias, so that might work in our favor and I can have a bit of a search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But it, I mean, the fact that it's UK statistics. Might be quite appropriate for them. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

We just, we just might might need to sort of cite it in their literature. To to sort of see what debates they're they're talking about. So that that's a bit of. Work for me to do. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

And and then, yeah, see what I mean? I asked our Dean and Alex talked about this associating and and he suggested research policy and science. OK, neither of those journals. I know anything about. I did look at the. The. Aims and scope and to me. Didn't seem to fit, but that was his initial suggestion. I don't know if you know anything about science that's an American. 

Speaker 2 

Science is absolutely tough, but I did. Yeah, it's a strange fit. I would. I would, I think of them as doing more like biology, kinds of stuff. Basically what they do is like really, really. 

Speaker 3 

You wouldn't say that. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

High profile stuff. Regardless of field and so maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is is is high profile maybe. But yeah, it strikes me as an odd as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you, I've heard of. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Yeah. I you don't think about research policy? 

Speaker 2 

No, but I think policy sounds like a good a good class of journals to maybe target, although we don't really. Have any policy implications? Currently but but. 

Speaker 3 

But could that could be strengthened? Perhaps. Yeah, that that brings to mind. Another journal called Milbank Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're AB BS. That's possible from a policy point of view. But maybe British Journal of Management is better. 

Speaker 

Excellent. 

Speaker 3 

That's yeah. So and then, I suppose work, employment and society. If we fail with BJM is like at the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. 

Speaker 2 

Perfect. Good, excellent. Excellent. That's great. That's great. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

Does that sound all right? 

Speaker 2 

Sounds great for me. 

Speaker 3 

So if I do a bit of a a literature search that the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until April and I've got seminar weeks coming up so and my diary is absolutely chock block. So the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days I think I could perhaps spend some time. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine. 

Speaker 3 

And actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well, so. I can do make a start on that. Then. And then so at least get you sort of some indication and? Yeah, but we I think this general management does seem to be quite a good fit and that's that's a good journal. If we get into that. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. Let's let's start there. Let's start there. I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week because like you, the. The next two to three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff, but reading week has been good and I'm making so I I'm gonna make a push to try to get, you know. The the results done. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team's gone. It's really, really, really, really great, so. 

Speaker 2 

It's been fantastic working with both of you, so thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So it would be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah, if we were to aim to do that for the summer, yeah. Is that too? No. Is that alright? I think by the time we sort of tidied everything up. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yep, I. 

Speaker 3 

And and then. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, June, I think is a good target and July would be good if we miss. You know, I think that's that's I think it's very feasible as well. I mean like I said the. 

Speaker 3 

And. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Right. So if April will will? Be able to come back to it and Polish and then you know. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I'm hoping next term won't be quite as bad as this term, but I'll have a little bit. We'll be just marking that. 

Speaker 2 

The finance or registered for you? 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. 

Speaker 2 

It doesn't end. It just never ends. It just. Never ends so. But OK, this is great. I'm going to I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll e-mail you with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the I'm not expecting any surprise. So the RDS stuff is done done and then the. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes. 

Speaker 2 

Some. I don't know. I'm. I'm. I'm not expecting to be surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. 

Speaker 3 

To see. Fantastic. Really. Really good that you wanted to. 

Speaker 1 

I have two. 

Speaker 3 

This. 

Speaker 1 

Two points. First, Doctor Moser, do you have anything that you need from my side other than to sort your references? Is there anything else? 

Speaker 2 

That's. 

Speaker 1 

And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We start with speak bot. You may have seen my e-mail that I don't want to be included in the publication for for this research. What do you think about them? 

Speaker 2 

I I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your to your PhD advisor to Doctor Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need if you wanna stay academic, you need publications and and in the past you've mentioned sort of wanting to. Fortify your quantitative credentials and this would certainly help with that. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I I mean I I think I understand his point. I understand his point. It's something like branding. Like you don't want to get labeled as something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just you need publications and full stop. So I I. 

Speaker 1 

That one from Doctor Randall. I have to say it's not from Doctor. It's from the mentor in the in the US. When I spent time there because I'm still having meetings with the professor there and he is also the Dean of the Department for International Relations and Politics. And recently we had another meeting. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. I see. 

Speaker 1 

And he told me. It would be not good if I have a profile that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that and I. And I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but I mean it it. 

Speaker 1 

Don't include my name is Risa. 

Speaker 2 

It one it's your decision. And of course I completely I completely respect that. And I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was doctor little you you might run by him then in that case get his opinion because he's, you know proper IR theory person and. 

Speaker 1 

That that's funny. 

Speaker 2 

And see what have you. Have you discussed it with him? 

Speaker 1 

No, we'll meet on Tuesday, so I will raise this up then. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. But I was saying to silly. We could perhaps acknowledge him in if if he's if he's sure that he doesn't want to be included in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I I just wanna. But perhaps it was an idiosyncrasy of the American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would. 

Speaker 

Of course. 

Speaker 3 

Just caution you to find out, Celine, whether it's an he's talking from an American perspective with that. The same applies in Europe if that's where you want to. To end up. 

Speaker 1 

All my supervisors are American thing to do is protect people other than you, Caroline. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. But but yeah, for sure. I mean I think sort of the the bottom line is is it's your decision of course. And I think I can speak truthfully to say that like you've definitely contributed a lot and I I I think you, yeah, you deserve to be credited in, in in some way and and thank you. I mean you've you've done. You've you've done a lot to to to help with the project, so. Yeah. So thank you. 

Speaker 1 

Take you too, that I could learn from both of you, and I still have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will. I will update you both after I speak to my first supervisor, doctor and. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, OK. Brilliant. Thanks. Then. Yeah. Do we need another date? Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on the e-mail from now on? 

Speaker 2 

Thanks everyone. Have a great weekend. Yeah, I think he most probably good April was probably, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. OK, right. That's super. Let let's stick with that then. Thanks very much. Bye bye bye. 

Speaker 2 

Thanks everyone. Have a great weekend. Bye bye.
