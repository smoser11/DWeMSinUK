Can you hear me excellent sorry I'm late I thought I slipped my mind at the coffee
shop and then popped up anyway sorry I'm late sorry sorry nice to see you all
how are you staying warm great how are you doing because you were I think you
had a doctor's appointment last week are you okay the health helps better thank
you yeah I'm cold but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it but
it's it's yeah I've been marking hell so how are how are you all yeah I'm doing
all right thank you yes I've been doing a little bit of teaching but just a
skills days for social policy social workers so yeah most of my teaching
takes place next term so I've got I'll be buried well I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm the
opposite so I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but enjoy enjoy while you can I
haven't touched anything since your last talk but if that said it's still
probably a good idea to touch base and see what's next or what's what what where
we are just so we don't sort of get off track thanks a ton for the draft I I
found the the sources and I give it a quick read but I haven't really done
anything I'm sorry yeah buried with teaching and grading so sorry no that's
okay I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it so it is it is a first
draft it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst
they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and
Celine might be able to contribute like sections of text so hopefully I'm not
asking you to put in anything that you're not not I'm able and willing to
contribute no that's of course thank you I missed that though can you what I don't
have it over and what so I mean obviously the the result the methods and
the results but yeah yeah so I've got some methodology down there but there's
obviously you're closer to the detail of what you're doing so yeah methodology and
results that's it and then yeah once we've got that in we can revisit the
discussion I put some points down but there will obviously be more coming out
when we've got the fuller paper to work with the other thing I'm aware that is
outstanding is you'd asked us if they were given the quite high proportion that
we're coming out with whether we could just look at some simple statistics to
see whether that proportion seemed sensible I'm wondering Celine have you
seen that email is that something you might be able to do for us you mean the
article no the Scots last email about taking just doing a sense check against
the proportion figure that he's finding no I didn't I told you just but also for
you Dr. Moses so I had in the last two through weeks my annual review the
preparation submission and also the exam that's why I didn't spend much time with
anything else but it went well so I passed the annual review good and yeah
so just update me quickly Caroline please so I'll forward you the email from
Scott because I've got it and then if you can just take it it's not a big job I
don't think but if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your
findings I mean Scots very kindly indicated which questions it relates to
so it's it's literally a percentage I think isn't it Scott yeah the issue is
just that so we've got these like fancy shmancy techniques which are great and
very preliminarily I and this was weeks ago I I
substance then and I know I had one cup of coffee today so this is all danger but
the sort of where I parked it mentally is we had some initial estimates using
these these sort of next-generation snowball samples for lack of a better
phrase and that is not a very good phrase and doing that gave some really
high at least it seemed to me really high numbers and so I was just thinking
allowed to Caroline and I welcome any and all inputs is just like what if we
don't do fancy shmancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the
proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern
slavery like what is that number I don't know what that number and whatever
that number is it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have a
random sample etc etc etc but just as a something to compare to the I don't
remember the exact numbers Caroline do you remember it was in the thousands
though what wasn't it in the well it was a proportion it was sort of 30% or
something yeah which just sounds really high I mean again it's the proportion
of my group of domestic workers who I think yeah possibly we can say even a
subset of those that are here that are from the Philippines or from Latin
America I think because that we're explicitly sampling that population
but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population yeah so yeah
and so that the percentage just seemed sound high to me but I don't know
anything about this so yeah it's possible yeah because they have no
protection yeah and and that's what I think it is possible I think it but I
think it and I think it would attract interest yeah so it would be good to
be sure as we can about what we're saying this this seems to be quite an
interest there's a lot of interest in this topic when Salim and I publish the
preliminary report just looking at the descriptive statistics we got a lot of
media attention for that so that was not really as exciting as what we're
doing here so I'm sure there would be continued interest from I mean there's
Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today he's sort of following our work and at the
rights lab he always keeps an eye on what press releases we create so he would
I'm sure pick it up again and yeah it is I mean from an impact point of view it's
it's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd
include ours in that but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has
produced a report but it's just descriptive statistics like us so this
really does move the conversation forward but that's great if there's no
say with the change of government if we presumably we get the change of
government then there's a task force which is charged with looking at this
issue within the first hundred days so it's potentially got policy impact so I
think some Andrea Rainer's leading something this that a colleague at
Nottingham Trent mentioned to me so this is the sort of thing that her team
would be interested in picking up as well so it could be really timely this
is bad I really want to be done with grading and get back to this this is
really exciting and that's what I was gonna say is that I wasn't aware of
these what there's word advocacy groups but I wasn't aware of sort of the
specificity that like you mentioned there's like a what was it Latin American
Women's you know and obviously you are connected to that but that's that
would be like you said that would be yeah I mean the more now we're having this
conversation and the once we start sort of sub-setting it down the the
proportion the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this
conversation so that's very exciting if true but okay there's a big caveat and
the big caveat there is so thank you Caroline again for the opportunity and I
completely agree with you that like if we can do some quanti stuff with this
yeah that would be you know the literature way better than I did but
like that's that's a contribution that makes me a little bit anxious because it
makes me think like okay well we really got to get these numbers right then
because you guys look at this isn't you know this isn't something that there's
sort of other it's like there's a pool of of this kind of quanti prevalence
estimation that we can sort of you know oh we're close or we're not so close so
different but here's why like it's pretty new so yeah but I mean yeah I agree and
when Bernard Silverman produced the stats the initial stats for modern
slavery in the UK he used multiple systems estimation to do that and he
produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by
policymakers which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end in that the
situation was far worse than his estimation suggested so I think you're
just talking to you're part of a conversation but the conversation keeps
evolving and the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that
are not correct but that are a way of engaging people in the debate so that's
as long as we're clear about what we've done how we've got to that I think we're
okay I think that's a really great perspective and not one that I had so
it's just a paraphrase you're saying like well I mean I mean essentially like
that's how science works is you you make some estimate you do some research and
then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed
or whatever and I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly
kind of like well gotta make sure this number is you know right for this method
is justified I think you're right that that's sort of not that's a luxury we
don't have in this particular research domain and that's just that's that's
that right that's that's that's not that's not a sin against us that's a nice
perspective I like that that's thank you for that Caroline yeah I mean I think
it's just listening to Bernard talk about his experience and yeah I mean I
think he said that the number of slaves between 11 and 13 thousand and then
later estimates suggested up to 148,000 right I just thought I mean yeah that was
quite a significant change in the number but his paper started that
conversation right and yeah so I think it's just viewing it as this is a
contribution to the debate based on these particular methods so when I get
time when I'm out of marking hell what's the what's the what's the next
step or help reorient me please as to what what I think it's trying to flesh
out that draft so I can go back to it and polish up what I've written and make
sure that it because it's not a bit less stream of consciousness but actually it
needs input from you and Salim as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's the
skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit once you've
had a chance to have a look at it it's got perhaps where you think we might
target it and whether it needs the sort of context setting to appeal to the
audience of the journal that we think we want to go for yeah good so okay thank
you that's helpful and I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my
mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in word and I
think you do understand latex don't you so it might be better actually to write
it in latex which I've never used but perhaps if we can get the draft up to a
certain standard you would be able to then transfer it for us yeah absolutely
that's fine actually and there's there's so back in the day you're right that
fact one of my early collaborators so I use latex and he didn't and we had this
project and he early on he was he was like we're never gonna publish this
because we just we're just gonna clash and so anyway I'm trying to say back in
the day that was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions it's
really straightforward to convert so we can we can still we can still we can
still talk to each other should be should be okay but yeah that's a good
point um Selene do you mind taking a step I don't know what what lit review in
terms of like the methods needs needs or is desired but do you feel comfortable
taking a stab at that so you know the basically I think I've sent along at
this point if you scroll the the the the patrol the trove of emails I've sent I
think there's and Caroline as well a number of papers that that address the
kinds of methods that we're using question mark so I I've written down
for now here the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the
methods section in the art field that Caroline sent and the second task is the
forwarded email so it seems there are some tasks I just had a glance into it
look into the email that Caroline just no forwarded and it asked them for you
Dr. Moseley you're asking for some information from my app so I will look
into that okay and what else is there the method section of the paper I've
already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies Selene so there
there is a method section there and then very sharp right it's okay I mean the
whole paper is 4,000 words currently I don't know quite what with we're
targeting what length we're targeting but I'm asked you specifically if you
could add the network structure graphic you remember that we put that actually
visualizes the structure of the network and and the way the extent to which it's
constructed of different waves okay so that was that section that yeah if you
could put that section in and then I've asked Scott if he could include the
point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated and
then the bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data
analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft because you know what
you've done so those areas are indicated in the paper I'll just put them in
they're indicated at the moment in just normal text I've just put them in bold
so you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier thank you that's great and
then obviously I can polish up the text but I don't want to spend too much time
doing that until results yeah until we know what the over whether it sort of
hangs together as a overall narrative yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I'll thank you
very much Caroline I see it it's it's I see what has to be done and I don't have
time to do it today yeah or what a weekend and also in the beginning of
next week so I'm I'm more free now great excellent is your time table get a bit
better in the new year then Scott is that yeah it gets better until about more I
have one of these intensive things and I plan to work so things will get a lot
better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research fiercely then but yeah for about
not quite a week but essentially the next week I'm yeah anyway it's I mean I see
what has to be done I can't wait to do it and and I'm so sorry but I simply can't
right now no no that's I mean I completely understand the teaching is
and something you can't ignore and and marking is just so many and the oh so
many so many so many yeah yeah I feel your pain well you be I'll sadly or why
don't know for better words so I'll I'll probably work over parts of the break
probably until late December and email and what I'm trying to say is I'll work on this
likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope
you're with your family I must admit my January is not too bad okay so if we can reconvene
perhaps in January does that suit you too Salim I could do online because or even in person
I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week but we could also meet online so
yeah online so would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've
got something to in the diary to work to yeah let's go so what ideally before the 15th of January
maybe yeah agreed would you want to pick it is Friday still going to be good for you Scott
I mean still teaching starts to be honest I don't even know my timetable for next
next term but the yeah Fridays should be should be fine um sort of I go to Salim before the
before the 15th but after the 4th would be good for me I think I'll I think I'll be traveling
until the 4th um uh so I don't know maybe try as the 12th yeah the 12th what's that like
sure yeah and does this time work much great for me a meeting of this time work
yeah it wants to be 11 a.m. again great good yeah let's put that in and then we'll see where we are
that's great that's that's that's a great deadline and that definitely gives me enough time to
that's great that's a great deadline for me thank you that's that's great and Salim if you just add
your section into the current document that's in the shared file then we've got one shared copy
that we're all working on that would be great we have done it before so yeah you'll sort of know
what we're doing with that so so is this oh yeah great so this is on the share uh the one drive
is that right yes okay it's not in the folder that you set up those but because I don't seem to have
access to put things in there but it is like it's on the one drive okay good the links in the email I
can resend it if you think that would be useful uh couldn't hurt you couldn't hurt uh I'm sure I'm
sure I have it but if you don't mind that would be great yeah thank you right let me see if I can
have you turn out or you don't worry about it I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder
so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it yeah we'll just see if I can find it
here we are here we go
right I've just really sent the email so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your
inbox now brilliant thanks a ton thanks a ton um oh good this is great so like I said I like that
this deadline um and now I must return to marking yeah and you might need more coffee I I absolutely
do so uh please please please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because uh that's vicariously
is the only way I will get to enjoy it so yeah so Dr. Moore I have been told by another academic
stuff when I told they told me during these two weeks of marking treat yourself eat the candies
eat the mass food or just to treat yourself from the marking marking strength that's great I will
thank you I'm that's great I'll I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well that's
thank you thank you thank you really great to see you all and and uh yeah I look forward to to
proceeding yeah yeah let's see if we can get something in the new year lovely good see you
happy holidays everyone take care yeah bye bye bye then
um
Thanks for watching!
