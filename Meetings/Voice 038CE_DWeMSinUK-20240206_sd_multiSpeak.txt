Speaker 1 

Hi everyone, sorry running late all the perpetual. It problems. How are you all doing happy? 

Speaker 2 

It's good to see you. Yes, we're just catching up with it. Just seems such a long time since we've met. I was saying to Celine my have I seen you since Christmas and I haven't done what we met at the beginning of December. I think last time Dash doesn't the time fly. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. I it sure does, and in fact I I never know when it's too late to say this, but happy, happy New Year. Happy 2024. 

Speaker 3 

Happy New Year all. 

Speaker 1 

Hope it's hope it's off to a good start, but now even January is gone. So yeah, time really is flying. But hopefully you all are are enjoying enjoying 2024 as it is. 

Speaker 2 

It's pretty busy. 

Speaker 1 

It seems that way this is so. This is your heavy teaching term. Is that right? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's right. We were just talking about teaching workloads. 

Speaker 1 

I'm I'm still stuck with. I can't. I just can't. Marking just never seems to end. It's just. 

Speaker 2 

It's just, it's just forever. 

Speaker 3 

You just need to do it. 

Speaker 1 

I I know and and and eat. Cakes which you. Were very kind to suggest to cilium, but uh yeah, I just. I keep thinking like, you know, OK, once I once I get this done then I can once I get this done then I can do you know X or Y. And it. Never ends, but anyway I'm. I'm so so glad for. We found time for this. Thank you so much, everyone. I confess I haven't. I tried to prepare a little bit, but I don't exactly thank you for your memo or agenda. Uh, Caroline the let me pull it up the. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I thought that just might help us sort of try and cover off the main things that you discussed in your videos, which were great by the way, really good idea to to sort of capture it. 

Speaker 1 

Took the time. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Capture your thinking at that particular stage. 

Speaker 1 

The the the the honest truth is I'm so bad at typing and spelling that I just figure making the recording is often just much more efficient. So, but thank you for taking the time to get and summarize. I think that's that's exactly right. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

I think it's great. I think it. I'm so pleased that you you think we're still in with a shot with this data. I think it's just fantastic what you're what you're doing and and whatever support I can give you and well I can't speak to slim but and and let him speak for himself. But yeah, I think it's really really interesting what. That how you're thinking about it, how you're conceptualizing the data and these new approaches that you've suggested, I think it's fantastic. 

Speaker 1 

It's it's all from. It's all thanks to you all. I mean, I wouldn't I. I wouldn't be anywhere near this project were it not for, not for you all. So, so, so no, thank you. So am I right in thinking about this that I mean, so the population are domestic workers in the UK and then the hidden population are those that are experiencing modern slavery. Probably once you just realized my backlog. Give me one second. Not look like a monster. I'm sorry about. Very sorry and that the the hidden population are domestic workers in the UK that are experiencing modern slavery, and we can catch that out in one of three different ways. I think. So dichotomously, which again I think and Caroline, you get credit for this. The two questions I don't remember top of my head was like 36 and 80 or something. They're very, in my opinion, they're very high bar and and so I think that's great. And then there's this kind of. Risk index that we put together, which could be like another. So so help me out. So if if we use this continuous risk index then isn't the population that we're sampling from or I guess I'm trying to say is? Aren't we making an assumption that everyone in? The population is. Has some degree to exposure of. Risk of experiencing modern slavery. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, this is interesting because the two indicators and I've picked up your question number, so I hope they are correct, silly. We'll be able to check for us, but there there are two you the way that exploitation is currently conceptualized is on a spec. Room and at one end you have minor infringements such as the National Living wage, which would be the question 36 are you paid sufficiently? And then at the extreme exploitation end, you'd have modern slavery question 80. So we've got two discrete markers on that scale. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So I wouldn't equate OK, failure to pay the national living wage with modern slavery. I don't think we can say that conceptually, but it is a form of exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And modern slavery is the most extreme form of exploitation. 

Speaker 

See. 

Speaker 2 

And then so we've got those two that you've sort of very cleverly identified as dichotomous variables. You're either slightly or not and you're either paid. Illegally or you're not. And then we've got this risk index, which is a more the grey area in between, which is the this composite. People just not. 

Speaker 1 

Tell perfect it helps a ton. No, and thank you for and this is again, This is why it's so awesome to work with you all. But so you can. My language was wrong. It's should be thinking about exploitation and modern slavery is 1 extreme form of exploitation. But really, there's this this spectrum and that that's. Enormously helpful that that helps me in thinking about the. Yeah. OK, that's really great. So then in that case, OK, so then the, the, the, the, the population is still domestic workers in the UK, I'm. Just thinking aloud, sorry. For for that, domestic workers in the UK and then we're the the, the, the, the, the hidden population are exploited workers within. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's fine. 

Speaker 1 

Exploited domestic workers in the UK, where that exploit measuring that exploitation we do in three different ways. One is this sort of minimal one is maximal and one is this, like you said, the great chain. I love that I think. 

Speaker 2 

The Gray area. 

Speaker 1 

That's why I. Didn't even I didn't really, I didn't. Caroline. OK, good. OK. So in that case, the so, so, so the I guess the one thing I can say. And I think I said the videos. I I'm surprised at how much more confident I am in the estimates from way back when, currently they seem. I'm willing to put my name to them. They seem quite they're. They're they're, in my opinion, they're shockingly high. They're they're very consistently depending on a bunch of model parameters, but sort of 30% is a conservative estimate. So there's something like 30 to 40. 

Speaker 2 

Oh brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Percent. So the interpretation there is. Again, depending on how we think about and measure exploitation 30 to 40% of domestic workers in the UK. Are experiencing some form of exploitation and in fact I can even tell you the the maximal one I was just looking at it is. So was it? It's question 80 is the. Is the the more extreme one? Yeah. 3030.7% is the estimate with the pretty reasonable estimate of uncertainty. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so. So I think this will make our, if you like, our message much more. It sort of turns it down a bit if we talk about exploitation. If we talked about 3040% in modern slavery, that that's very dramatic and we'll we'll be a front page of the Guardian, which we don't necessarily want to be that dramatic. So I think if we talk about labour exposition, it just tones it down slightly and we're acknowledging that. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Modern slavery is an extreme form, but it's not the the sole focus of the topic, so hopefully that makes you feel a bit more comfortable about the size of the problem as well. 

Speaker 1 

It it it it does and and like I said. Thank you I. I'm I'm so glad and I don't know. Feel kind of foolish actually, because like the, the more we talk, the more I realize. Oh, actually, I'm not. I haven't actually been thinking anyway, so like this, this modern slavery versus exploitation business is is. Yeah, no, these these results make a lot of sense. I mean, they're really, really high, but they're they're consistent and. So for example, if. You look at the estimated proportion that are experiencing this extreme form of slavery. It's 12% less than the estimated proportion of those experiencing the mildest form of exploitation, which logically makes perfect sense. And the the intervals. Makes some sense. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah, that that's good. So that's. So I suppose that on what we what I have done when I put the composite together was mixed up these the the dichotomous and the continuous variables. So we need to separate that out now obviously. So we have another stab at that. Celina you did you follow that? The the the logic that Scott sent through about this difference between because I've mixed up. Labour exploitation question 30. Whatever is with the other risk indicators of forced labour, I put it as a weighting at .3 and actually we can't do that well. I can't do that because it that will affect the composite variable calculation, so it won't be accurate the way the way I've currently specified it. 

Speaker 3 

I don't know which document opinion you're referring to. I know there has been the video recording from Doctor Moser and you have responded to it just before this meeting. This is so you sent me an e-mail before. 

Speaker 2 

Right. You know, this was really sort of what came out of Scott's earlier. I can't remember when we discussed it. Let me revise the composite measures and send those through to you. Well, send them through to both of you, but particularly to slim because we'll need to recalculate those composite. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Values based on the understanding that we've I've mixed up a dichotomous variable with it. Continuous risk indication. Fair report if you sent. 

Speaker 3 

Me the the document or whatever I should look at just to double check and recalculate. I can do that. 

Speaker 2 

That recalculating. No problem. Brilliant. I'm sorry it takes to work cuz it means going back and redoing. Something that we've already asked you to do, but. 

Speaker 3 

And that's part of the. Work. 

Speaker 2 

It's much clearer now. I think we're sort of learning as we go. It's heuristic. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. But so hang on, Caroline, I think I'm. About to have a second mental breakthrough for the day, so I understand the composite measure that we made is is like this weighted sum of these various indicators. But what's I missed? What why you think it? What? What's wrong with it? 

Speaker 2 

Because I've included question 36 and I've given it a slightly heavier weighting, but I've included it within the composite risk. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 1 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

So I I think I wasn't very happy when I did it and I think it's probably better if we split it up. Out. And then we then we've got this clarity about these two, the question 36 and the question 80 are clear, clearly illegal activities but at different ends of the scale, right? And the other risk factors provide a composite picture which could be indicative of forced labor. It's much cleaner if we do it that way. 

Speaker 1 

OK, I think I I think I say no. So it's not necessarily the case. That I think again. Thank you so. So I was originally thinking is that OK exploitations on a spectrum? We have these two kind of endpoints question 36 and question 80 and that the composite measure would sort of be in between these two endpoints. But if I'm understanding you, that's not really the right way to think about it we have. So that's one way to interpret. Here's the 2nd way to interpret. Yes, exploitation is on a continuum and here we have indicators for the endpoints. And then separately, we have this this continuous indicator which doesn't necessarily fit in between these two endpoints. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but it's not the case that does that make sense? It's not the case that. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, I think that's more accurate. It's separate. I think it's. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Separate. Yeah. Thank you. So. Much I tested that seriously. That was the 2nd in the last 15 minutes. You've given me two. Yeah. OK, that's very helpful. And actually that will help me in interpreting the I was a bit. Uncertain how to interpret the the estimate of the continuous indicator but but this discussion helps me a lot in in, in. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

In understanding what those results are are are saying relative to the to the dichotomous measures. So thank you. 

Speaker 2 

So. So that was I mean that. That was clear to me from your discussion about this difference between dichotomous variables and and a continuous 1, so that I think if you're happy with that approach, I think that sort of moves us forward, although it means redoing a. Bit of work. 

Speaker 1 

Perfect. And also just to be totally clear, I wasn't aware that's what I was saying. So really you you get credit for that Caroline completely. That's really no, no, that's that's that's awesome. OK, that's that's a huge clarification I do have and I don't want to hijack the conversation at all. I have sort of a big. I guess. Two medium sized questions and then some really kind of obnoxious small but technical questions if. If, if I may, if that's OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. 

Speaker 1 

So the OK, I guess maybe. OK, let me do the small ones first, so. Uh. Right. So the don't know is the deer stuff. Is fine. There's one. Nagging data issue that I still have and it's it's this business about zero, so some people I don't remember, I think I said 17 or something, a handful of people report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK. So you know they're reporting that their network size is 0. Now some of these are clearly an error because then when it comes to the referral question, can you give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK? They provide one. So. So some people who say, I know zero people in the UK then provide a cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK so. So clearly those people are wrong, so I'm comfortable sort of finding them and turning their zeroes into at least one again, that's that's conservative because we know that they've reported at least one, so one. OK, so that's one issue and then two. There's still some extra zeros, some people who say no. I know zero people in. Sorry. I know zero domestic workers in the UK and I've reported zero and I don't exactly know why, but those zeros are messing up the estimators. The estimators can't handle. I'm guessing it's like a divide by zero problem or something like that where? So the question? Is. What to do with the the true zeros? Two options, one is. We just sort of. Gin it up and say let's just add one for everybody, which isn't really. I mean it solves a problem technically, but it's really really sketchy. Or to remove the the true zeros. So what to do with the true zeros is one question and then this. The easier question is. What do we think about turning the zero the the wrong zeros into ones? Are we comfortable with that? Again, we're talking about a handful of of people, but with the sample size of 97, a handful of people is not true, you know? So does that make sense? The two questions make sense. Or am I? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, no, it it does make. And I mean, I'm tempted to say take them out, but I don't know what that. Does to the. That seems because anything else is a fudge, isn't it? 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. Exactly. So what I have been doing is just adding one to everybody and just saying like, you know, just but I completely agree with you that the, the, the what it does is it it it, it does increase our uncertainty and I think it increases. A bit I don't remember exactly, but I agree with you that that sort of that's the most principled, are we OK turning the zeros into ones for people who do nominate or or make a referral or? 

Speaker 2 

Are we? Are we turning them into the number that they nominate? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 2 

So they nominated two people. We turned them into twos. Is that? And then one, did they nominate one? Is that how? 

Speaker 1 

That's right. Exactly, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

We're doing it. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. That's how we could do it, which I. I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we have. 

Speaker 1 

I'm comfortable with that myself. 

Speaker 2 

If if yeah, I think if we take out the ones that are. 

Speaker 1 

If you all are. 

Speaker 2 

Through zeroes. Don't know what the implications of that. Has for the. For how we're sampling, but I mean, if we just say that's what we've done. It's a limitation of the estimating technique really, isn't it? 

Speaker 1 

Yes, that's right. It's not a data limitation, it's not a data limitation, it's an estimation. You're 100% right? Yeah, it's it's an, it's a limitation of the estimation. That's right. 

Speaker 2 

So you have to. 

Speaker 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I think we can probably just say that. So it's. And so we've got 2, two things that we're doing then. So we're taking out. The true the ones that really are zeroes, and for the ones that. Do nominate. We're then increasing their. We we're correcting the data. 

Speaker 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

To reflect that they do know. They do have other people in their other they do have other. Domestic workers in their networks. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, exactly. And I think that's conservative, but I have to say what I mean is I think. What we're doing is we're saying, well, we know we don't know this person's degree size. We know that it's an error, and so we're assigning it a value that's the smallest possible size it could be. If you've nominated two people given 2 cell phone numbers, we know that, you know at least two. But maybe, you know, more that you just have it nominated. So by changing the 0 to a 2IN that case. That's. I think what we're doing we're underestimating that person's network size, which I think is conservative. I think what I mean is I think I think that won't inflate our our estimates. I think I should double check that though. But if if it's, I'm almost sure. But anyway, I'll have, I'll that should be my homework, but if so, then I think that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Perfectly fine, because what? We're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot, really. I mean, so whatever we find is gonna be. Yeah. Is. Yeah. I think it's gonna be fine. So because the degree set. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That's so there's sort of two, two-part solutions to that problem. So we take out the true ones and then we. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Sort of modify the data to reflect the actual sample size for the others. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Good. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, those both sound reasonable to me. Salim, do do. Steve. Does that sound OK? 

Speaker 3 

I have the similar suggestion that you have made based on the number or the amount of people they have provided the phone numbers, so we could take the amount of the phone numbers they have provided although. We have reported in the earlier question that they don't know any other domestic workers in the UK, so modifying it should should make it consistent with the other existing survey findings. 

Speaker 1 

Good. Excellent. Thank you. OK. Yeah, that's what that is excellent. So see, in increasing order of easiness. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Uh, yeah, I'm increasing order of easiness, uh. OK, I'll save this. So what we want to see, but that's at the end. Domestic worker size. So I I went back and double checked and it's it's it's it's it's true. Terms of. So the thing that we're estimating is a proportion. But to do that, one of the one of the inputs into so we have this our data and we have a bunch of parameters and all that's great. One of the inputs that's required for the estimators that I'm currently using, not for the end sum estimator, but for the the RDS estimators is a is a guess is a is a prior belief on the the the size of the population that we're sampling from. So what that means is. We ideally we would know how many domestic workers there are in the UK with the cell phone, so we know we we know the number, we know the size of the population that we're sampling from. Not enough course, not necessarily the number of those experiencing exploitation. This doesn't have to be a hard and fast number. It can be like. Well, here's my best guess. Or here's a range or whatever, whatever. But we need that number, and I've been looking. I kind of just, I thought I thought it would be easy to find. Like. On like a Labor Statistics site or something. And I I I haven't come up with a great number, one that I'm super happy with. My best guess is something like 1.7 million, which sounds a bit high, but then again there's a lot of people in the UK anyway, so if you have suggestions on where to get information on. On reliable information on the number of domestic workers in the UK in the period that we were sampling, that you all were were sampling, that would be great, would have been doing is just making up numbers and. I've just been. I've been making up numbers and sort of increasing them by orders of magnitude. So suppose there's 10,000. Suppose there's 100,000. Suppose there's a million, and seeing how, just as a very crude way, to see how, how the how those inputs affect the outputs. And the the good news is they they seem to affect the outputs not very much. So there is this is great news actually this this means it's our estimates are relatively insensitive to to the prior knowledge namely the the number of domestic workers in the UK that said at some point we'll need to settle on a number that that you know will will use I mean and of course we'll say. See Appendix for robustness. But you know for. The stuff that we report. I'll need a number. Does anyone have any thoughts on where to where I could, where to find information on on that? 

Speaker 2 

Well, the only thing that we've suggested in the past, which may not be very helpful, is the overseas domestic worker visa numbers because that is a fixed statistic that ought to relate to how many visas for a six month period because they they last for six months and then they expire and people. Have to go home. Theory. And I can't remember off the top of my head what that number was, but I think it was around 76,000. 

Speaker 1 

It sounds about right. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So if we, I mean that's my best stabber. An official statistic. I don't know if you've come across anything. 

Speaker 3 

So we have adopted, we have adopted to the most recent. 

Speaker 2 

Addition to that. 

Speaker 3 

With publishing from, I think it must also in the Guardian and it also referred guardian of times that news article and it also referred to the government UK page of UK. Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah. So they regularly publish that. So yeah, it's about 70, something 70 or 80,000 I. 

Speaker 3 

The update. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so I don't know how satisfactory that is. I haven't. I'm not familiar with the web pages you mentioned that you looked. At. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So if you if it's possible to send me the link, I could have a look. And and see if I can. If that sort of turns it into any more robust ideas. But at the moment that the only thing I can suggest which doesn't help us for the non British, sorry for the British nationals, but. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, but it's, I mean, it's fine. It's it. I mean, the the good news is like the, the the qualitative results are really, really again, surprisingly robust, so. You know, we can see here's a number that we can use and we can give a site to and say clearly this is an underestimate. Again, C appendix B for sensitivity analysis. You know I'm I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm I'm perfectly fine with that because the results are. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Again, qualitatively are really consistent, so I'm fine with that. So so no, thank you for that thing for that. OK. I've got two more. One at least one I think is a bit is a bit tricky. So I've been so you can identify three groups, 3 subgroups here. At least I I'm sure you all can probably identify more those by ethnicity. So those coming from the Philippines. Those are easy to identify. Those that come from some Spanish speaking countries. Like Bolivia, Colombia, but also Spain and. And. UK nationals who aren't. One of these. Who aren't in the first two to two categories. Is. The question is, do we want to do anything with that information in in in the following sense? In fact, Caroline you suggested we could perform estimation separately, like completely separately like like, just use this group data. Just use this data. Just use this dating at three different set the the the UK people. I mean it's. Really small so. The main interest would be on the so for the Philippines, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I wanted to get your thoughts on well. So the general question is, do we want to do anything with that information here? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Are some things we could do. Split them up into three groups, perform analysis separately, but especially between the two non UK and national groups. Question mark. If so, how comfortable are we group the Philippine one? The Philippine Group subgroup seems pretty, very straightforward, very justified to me. Are we OK? Lumping Ecuadorians with Bolivians with Spanish, you know, sort of putting all Spanish people coming from Spanish speaking countries together. When I say together, I mean. In the same subgroup. To to which we will. Perform our estimation. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

I don't know what. Sensitivities we might be and the the thing that comes to mind is Burt Burt and his class. Have you? Have you ever read a paper by Cyril Burt about? It's highly controversial racist science. And actually, he lumped people together and measured their brain size, and then concluded that. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

People in certain racial groups have smaller brains. It's got. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

I remember this. Yeah, this is. 

Speaker 2 

And. And there's been a huge critique. Obviously this paper. Yeah, and. It was depicted as racist science because people, because of the assumptions that he made when he grouped people. 

Speaker 3 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 2 

And I don't know what the sensitivities are about grouping Ecuadorians and Spanish people into some sort of larger category. And and I don't know whether that any if we did that, it would. 

Speaker 1 

I don't know either. 

Speaker 2 

Stand the test of time, or whether we might be called out in future for some sort of atrocity that we don't even know we're committing. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So I don't know about that I want is there value in doing the Filipino grouping to me as far as I can predict sounds safer, yeah. Anna, is it? Is it? Does it show any distinction? Any distinct differences from taking the I don't know. 

Speaker 1 

I I I tell take your. Point it's a thank. You. It's a very good I hadn't even thought about the sort of tested time aspect. That's a really, really good point. My wanting my, my reason for doing my reason for. Doing this is twofold. One is just very, very technical because the. The estimators that I'm using have this underlying assumption that truly in the world the social network is connected, which means that there's some path between the Ecuadorian and our sample, and the Philippine and our sample. Somebody this person knows, somebody knows somebody who knows somebody, somebody who knows this person. Fine. We don't have to make that assumption, but it makes my life a lot easier. I think there's reasons to challenge that assumption, namely by by language. For example, you might think that this, that. A group of. Philippine domestic workers are. Are are separate, are separated from other maybe, and maybe that's racist of me to say in the 1st place, but but. 

Speaker 2 

I'm not suggesting we're being racist, I'm just using that as an example, but did when he realized he was making a racist assumption when he did it. Yeah. And I think we just have to be careful if we under we, we might not understand the the assumptions we're making. Yep. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I think I think that's what I'm hearing from you is, is is maybe just. Don't subgroup. Well then the second reason I was I raised this, I wanted to separate. This is because because of these, in my opinion, relatively large estimated proportions, I was curious about heterogeneity, right, like where where are these big numbers coming from? Basically. So that was sort of a more substantive motivation and and and to answer your question. And I don't know. I haven't actually performed. I haven't done the estimation by subgroup, so I don't even know if it's anything interesting there, so maybe I should do that first, and this might be moot. I guess is, I don't know the answer to. Question, but what I'm hearing is like play it safe and don't. Maybe it's not such a good. Maybe we just leave. We leave the analysis at the. Using the entire sample all at once and justice state the assumptions and move on. 

Speaker 2 

I don't know. It's tempting. It's tempting to have a look at it. I mean, particularly for me, for the Filipino group, because we've got quite a large 2/3 of the group is Filipino. So could we somehow test? The distinction between the Filipino group and the broader sample is that that strikes me as being a sort of safe test to initially dip our toe in the water with hopefully out and not offending anybody by by means that we know that we don't understand. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. That's and like I said, that's actually on my end. That's a. That's a much easier data task because identifying that subgroup is just easier. 

Speaker 2 

Nicely, clearly delineated. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So thank you. I I I'll do that and include that my next like I said, I. We haven't. I just haven't done that analysis. But yeah, I'll do that. OK. That sounds great. OK. So the last hard question is. What do we want to present? What? What? What do you do? You want me to make tables? Do you want to make pictures? Do you want me to make P values? Like what? What do we want to? From the results, what do we want to show and how do we want to show it? I don't know if I'm being clear. I'm probably being overly vague, aren't I? So we'll have. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. Yeah, no, I think it's a really reasonable question. It's just one, I don't think that I know the answer to. So I suppose it's tied in to where we think this might be publishable and how technical a journal that is and and whether it's a journal that would require that sort of technical detail. Or if we were publishing in a more lay journal for want of a better way of putting it. Whether that would be a turn off because they just it depends, I suppose. Who's gonna review it and what are they going to expect to see? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Because we talked about various journal articles, sorry, journal outlets. We talked about the Journal of Modern Slavery, where I'm sure I don't think it would be going well. I may not be right. Then it might be going to statistical experts. In whatever technique we, we finally land on. So in in because there is quite a lot of prevalence estimation within the modern slavery literature. So there will be people who do have statistical understanding. But I think you'd also mentioned was IT pros PLOS. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Uh-huh. Uh, huh. 

Speaker 2 

And and really, I don't know anything about what their readership would expect. 

Speaker 1 

They're pretty technical, so modern slavery you're saying, is a pretty technical, or at least they have. Technical competences. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I think there is increasing interest in prevalence within the modern slavery literature. There are recognised practitioners. So I'm thinking of Clifford signs at the unit at Nork and they do a lot of prevalence estimation. They work in the modern slavery field. So I would say if I was suggesting reviewers. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Uh-huh. 

Speaker 2 

That's it's that research group that potentially I'd identifiers being a potential reviewer. 

Speaker 1 

No, I'm. I'm taking notes. Thank you. OK, so. To make my life easy, it sounds like I'll start with with. Just text, you know, point estimates, conference rules, whatever. Personally I'm I'm very very visual, so I think I think pictures are are easier to interpret for me than than than words. But but but it's also more work on my purse. It sounds like I'll start with the point estimates confidence interval. So the the, the, the, the plain Jane so to speak. But now I should say ways of present. Presentation and then we can tweak from if we need to. When we get closer to submission is it? Is that what I'm hearing is that? Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think I don't think I can add anything particularly helpful. To this conversation, and other than just trying to tailor it to whatever outlet we go for. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I I too like diagrams like that and I think Celine's already added a sort of representation of the network. So something along those lines really helps to. To make the. Hard statistics. More understandable. Yeah. So, yeah. Have have I agree with you that diagrams have great explanatory power. 

Speaker 1 

Totally the same. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. OK. OK, I'll. Good, but that sounds good. So. I'll sort of we'll. I'll start and then like if we can revisit this when we get closer to submission, but just no, that's helpful for me. That's very, very helpful for me. I think those are all my questions. Let me. Double check please. Ohh, and and you're right, I do. I haven't this there is this third approach actually of getting increasingly excited by or about that I haven't done, which is this combining the the RDS with the the. Yeah, your .7, Caroline, exactly everything I've done and we've talked about is very off the shelf, which is fine. I'm not at all. I mean, these are. This is absolutely. Proper but but there is this we initially way back when started talking about this he had this very cool idea to do in some estimation and and and talked and thought and Scott thought some more and read some more and confused himself and but yeah there is there definitely is this way to combine the two. I haven't done it. It will be manual, but I'm I'm I'm very excited by it about it because mainly for the comparison, because you know all of these RDS techniques are. Getting qualitatively the same, you know 30 to 40% depending on XYZ, whatever. But they're all this class. Of estimators are all giving. Similar, but in my opinion really high estimates, and I'm really curious to see how this sort of you know, this outsider, this outsider in some method would come. It's also cool because there's a sense. In which it's. It's it's using more information that you already have in your sample, which I think is I'm always a huge fan of. Of that. You know using all the data that you can. So I haven't done that. I don't know what your thoughts on like is that should I make that a priority is that is it is the. Is the RDS enough? Do you have any thoughts? 

Speaker 2 

It sounds really exciting. I mean it's you've got the time to do it. Yeah, well, she's always. We don't. We never have time to do anything. But if you want. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

If you find there is time, then it sounds really exciting and really interesting and that is where we started this journey trying to work out how to do nuisance so to try and if we if we can. If our data can say anything along those lines that would be really exciting to know. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I I. Agree. And even if I'm again, it depends on where we're gonna do it. It's not like. The Journal of the American Statistical Association. I mean, it's not. It's what I'm trying to say. There is a, there is a methodological innovation here. It's not huge. It's sort of. Taking this paper and taking this paper and recognizing that they have the same D and I can use that, I can put them together, but I haven't seen it done. And I think it's, I think it's a very cool idea to to combine these two and like, like you said here like since since. I mean the information's there. It's sitting in our Excel file, right? Like why not? OK, so if we're gonna do that. Then I might. Ask one piece of help from Celine or whoever, and that's to code up the bootstrapping procedure so I can do the estimator. But we'll need to estimate the uncertainty and we know how to do that. It's with the paper that actually you summarized and included Caroline in your bootstrapping doc. Uh. But we'll have to. We'll have to write that up in our. Can you do that, Salim? Or is that not something you're comfortable with? 

Speaker 3 

I I can start looking into it. 

Speaker 1 

OK, that would be. 

Speaker 3 

Great. And I will update you. 

Speaker 1 

Wonderful, the. I'll e-mail you both with the let me make note to your bootstrap it. There's a lot already written. You've got a good head start in that, like there's the paper is pretty readable. They have some supplementary information. They have some R code already. So you you. You're not starting from scratch, but it would. You will need. Well, we will need at some point to implement this for this particular method. It would be a big help to me if. I could do the estimation part and you could work on the bootstrap. Part. And then ****, and then press publish. 

Speaker 3 

Can you can you share this paper again with me? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, absolutely. I'll share the paper and the the supplemental information. There is bootstrap just making notes to myself. But yeah, that's absolutely fine and I'm glad to hear that you're excited about the sum too, Caroline, that, that that's invigorating. That's that, that, that, that, that helps. That helps me. Like I like that. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really good. I think. I think there's one thing we have missed from your from that list and your video, I don't think we've talked about #2. Which was how how we how, how we've dealt with the don't knows in the data at the moment and we perhaps need to to code them slightly differently. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. Good point. 

Speaker 2 

Perhaps as missing, I think that was your suggestion. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. And so I, I and. Please do not take any offense whatsoever. Slam your your your your recoding is is absolutely you know invaluable. But I I did change it a little bit in that. I think and please correct me if I think you had been coding. So, so, so so the issue is there's, there's, there's these different categories that one can answer, of course and. Almost always one of the answers is don't know or not. Don't prefer prefer not to say or what have you and slim you had been coding those replies as an absence of. Exploitation, however, measured in whatever type of exploitation. And. I've recorded those as just missing, so you just take those observations out again. That's a bit conservative because that because by wait is it no, it's anti conservative. So the absence of yeah. So right my bad. That's anti conservative because by removing the. By taking OK two options, people who say they don't know are not experiencing exploitation. People who say don't know are not in our analysis. Here's Salim's initial way. Here's what I what I'm suggesting now that I'm thinking about it, I think my suggested way is is is anti conservative because relatively speaking it'll look like there's more people in exploitation. Using my method in Salim's method. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

Interesting, Caroline, thanks for bringing this up. I I missed this. Yes. So the question is what do we want to do with the donos? That's exactly right. 

Speaker 2 

OK, I'm just following what you're saying about. If you take them out. 

Speaker 1 

I think that's right. 

Speaker 2 

And it makes things look. Plus. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Worse. Worse. Worse, better. Right. Right. I think that's right. Because there's. 

Speaker 2 

They had been coded as not experiencing exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, which is not really what we want to do. I suppose by nature I would be more conservative. And we don't want given that we've already got 30 to 40% of the population. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

You don't want to make it make it. Look even worse. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So we could say that we could say well, here's how we couldn't knows. And by the way that's conservative because yeah, we're because really we're making a judgment call we we just as easily could say well, no actually the don't knows are experiencing exploitation. I mean it's arbitrary right like how how, how, how so in in putting it in the not experiencing. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Exploitation. Counting them as not experiencing exploitation. Yeah, I agree with you, Caroline. It's. It's making our yeah, it's conservative because then. Our estimated proportion of those experiencing, yeah, the estimated proportion would be small. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. My apologies, Selim. I did. I you had it right all along. My bad. 

Speaker 2 

My bad. No, it's really useful clarification that so we and we're just sort of being clear about what we're doing, but it's good that we don't have to recode it, so. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. No, that's great. That's great. 

Speaker 2 

But I I I think we're erring on the side of caution, so that seems to be the right way to to be airing. Agreed. Brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

I've been trying to type up what we've agreed just on the same e-mail. The only one I haven't got anything against is 6. What do we say? Ohh the six is just a statement really. You would just your the current method you've been using for analysis and what it does. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. And so I finally sort of wrapped my head around these RDS sort of in in in a way that I should have ages ago. And I sort of I see what they're all. They're all. They're all doing the same thing and they're all just making a little bit of adjustments differently. And So what I'm thinking of doing is saying, you know, when we review the literature like, OK. Here's. These here's all these various RDS methods and yeah, they have different assumptions and we're going to do all of them, but in the appendix. And here's the one that we're gonna pick to present because. In fact, actually the one I found one even better than the s s RDS or RDSS called the model assisted. I like it better at least, but the point is we have all these sort of related methods. These RDS methods and my thinking is to just pick one. For for presentation in the main text and then say you know see Appendix whatever for for comparison and the. The the things. Really are quite different and and but again for us the numbers are virtually identical. Weirdly so. Yeah, I know, right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that means something about robustness, I think. That's my that's not rigorous, but that's sort of my. My thinking is that. Or it could mean something else, and it could mean that that whole debate and the prevalence literature is is wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles, you know is is, is doesn't really matter, it could. It could mean that the the differences in the assumptions and the the way that the different weights are calculated doesn't really matter very much is what it could mean. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

But regarding .6 is that is that are are we cool with these simply picking one for presentation purposes and then, you know, here's the Boltzmann Hoff estimator. And here's the guile assess estimator. And here's the model assisted estimator. 

Speaker 2 

Interesting. 

Speaker 1 

Blah blah, blah blah blah. Or or should we or alternatively I? Guess we could just. Pick one and and just justify it as strongly as as we can. I don't know. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. I think we have to. We have a reason for picking the one that we picked, but that that's up to us. And I'm happy to be guided by you on that. 

Speaker 1 

That's that's very polite and very clever. If you think that's. Very good girl. But the reason I'm I'm a little bit humming hiding is is there's there's basically two that I think are sort of the clear. UM. 

Speaker 2 

From the city. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly. And and I don't really have a strong preference on either. So that's that's more homework for me, I suppose the. Yeah, yeah, well, the homework bit is is is the justification, right? Like, I've got to pick one. And so right. So two are easy to justify. Which one of the two? I mean, again at the end of the day subsequently doesn't. It's not going to matter because the all but. But you're 100, right? Like we gotta pick one to use in the main text to show the results of. To do the bootstraps for them, whatever. So that's yeah, that's that's. All right, that's on me. That's on me. Very good, very good. Thank you. Bring that up, Caroline. Again. Thank you for bringing that up. It's just you brought up a really great point. So thanks. 

Speaker 2 

Right. I think we're there. Brilliant. It's really exciting. This is a lovely conversation to have on a Friday. We should we should do more often. 

Speaker 1 

I'd love to, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And is it sensible to try and put a a provisional meeting date in the diary just in case it keeps us sort of at least talking about when they can be, even if we find nearer the time that we can't and our Friday is generally OK for everybody, I can generally do a Friday, so then you're nodding and Scott this. 

Speaker 1 

Afternoon, after it would have to be. 

Speaker 2 

Afternoon. 

Speaker 1 

Definitely. After one, uh, likely so this time is fine. Two is totally fine. But yeah, Friday after one at the earliest. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So if I pop another date in in what a months time or sooner? 

Speaker 1 

You know I would, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Then sort of three weeks, 2 weeks. 

Speaker 1 

Slim how much time do you have to? OK. Yeah. Anything's good for me. My well, once I finish marking. 

Speaker 3 

16th. 

Speaker 1 

Anything good with? Me, which should happen this weekend. So yeah, I'll have time this. So so whenever is fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry, what did you say two or three weeks? 

Speaker 3 

Which would be the 16th of February. OK, at 2:00 PM or before noon or before noon time. 

Speaker 2 

OK, 2:00 PM. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's put that in and we'll see what happens when we get there. And we can always tickle it out if we need to. But yeah, that's super. 

Speaker 3 

So for my tasks, before we end conversation, I will do that coding up for the bootstrapping. And Doctor Moser, you said you would share that paper with me and some information for what I should do and how I do it. And Caroline, you mentioned earlier something about checking or rechecking the the composite measures. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, yeah. Recalculating the composite measure. I'll send you A1. Pager of what I think now ought to be in it. 

Speaker 3 

OK, this would be helpful. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I'll try and do that as soon as I can, which probably means I have to try and do it this afternoon and then we'll. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK then. 

Speaker 2 

And then, yeah, if you can just recalculate risk variable 2. If we keep the original, but we we try another column with the revised composite. And then we haven't lost anything. But I think at the moment it's wrong as it stands for, for how we're conceptualizing the data. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Thanks everyone. It's really nice to see you all and and and and happy 2024. So all right, we'll e-mail and talk soon. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. Yeah. Good to see you shot. Yeah, I'll. I'll send the out. The points of the note that I made. So we've all got a copy. Brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Thanks everyone. Talk to you later. 

Speaker 3 

Thank you. Hi.
