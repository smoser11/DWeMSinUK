Transcript 

Speaker 1 

And I came on last Saturday. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Hello, docomo. 

Speaker 3 

Hello, good afternoon everybody. How are you? 

Speaker 2 

Hi, good to see you. 

Speaker 

And you. 

Speaker 2 

I would. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, go ahead, please. Caroline, I'm not prepared. So. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I was gonna say thank you for your e-mail. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking. It's just a way of trying to keep an aide memoir, isn't it? Of of where we're up to with this, really. So it's really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. 

Speaker 2 

We might, we might have a path forward. From what you're saying. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, honestly, I I had to write everything down cause I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that e-mail, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That sounds really good. Yeah. No. And I keep talking while you're looking for it. So interestingly, the Nook paper that you mentioned in it, I think that there that is the first of two studies that they've done and we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I showed with you was the second study. 

Speaker 3 

Please. Thank you. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

They should have done a cohorts study. And so now we've got. Both, so that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional that we've managed to track down both. 

Speaker 3 

Reports small world. Yeah, but. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think we know what we're where they're where they're publishing anyway and so that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the the guile. Is it guile? You pronounce her surname. But I will read that and that will be useful for just putting the literature review related to RDS together. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. And then. 

Speaker 2 

Selim has done a fantastic job of thinking actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started. So I think we've made some, some pretty good progress this week. So I, I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings. So that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the e-mail, Scott? Would you want to chat with them? Chat about the risk assessment and everything? 

Speaker 3 

Still can't find it. Yeah, if you don't mind. Please do. I'm so sorry. I. Yeah, so sorry. Please. Please. 

Speaker 2 

Now we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then, right. So what I tried to do, slim as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right. There are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally, and Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning a weight so that overall they would add up to 1. So we had effectively an index of of. No exploitation through to in every form of exploitation we could think of. And and we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there might be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process. But from what you're saying in your e-mail system, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. So I have, I have gone through gone through these steps that you have sent me in your e-mail last Friday and they all 97 people. You know, so you have some level of exploitation and if you go to the? Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night. You can see when you go to. The column some categories so you can see that 0.3660.20.1 and that continues so and as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13. Categories that we have asked our respondents. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So the question that I had and forgive me if I. Misunderstood this, but we when we put the the measures together, there was some that were sort of composite measures. So there, there would be thirteen sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement where there were two or three together. So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding slim or have you just done a a sort of all or nothing coding? 

Speaker 1 

I've done it all on nothing coding, so is this the? I mean I didn't. I can't. Last week the the meeting that you had, it is it's just a complication then. 

Speaker 2 

Well, this is I. I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this we've got. I mean definitely you've answered the first question was that how many people in this sample we experienced any form of exploitation and we know. Because of the way we've selected organizations. To approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation and not just generic. People working in the sector. So that I think. Is good for our the clarity of our method. And and I suppose the question is, could we or do we want to do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got, because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've. Design the measures is it is just purely A cumulative sum. But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub. Totals almost. I suppose that's a question for Scott in terms of what we can do. When we run. 

Speaker 3 

Little, I'm sorry. 

Speaker 2 

How how are you? No. How you how you sort of conceptualize the risk index? 

Speaker 3 

First cup of coffee, so apologies to all but I'm not exactly so I I see there's what 13 categories. Is that right? Some number of categories? Yeah, 13 categories and celines for each person. Celine indicated the extent to which they. Fit in that category and the categories in the Word document are. Oh, I see the the categories aren't individual questions, they're. Compilations of questions. Is that correct? 

Speaker 2 

In some cases. 

Speaker 3 

In some cases. 

Speaker 2 

It's not always we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And then? So so sorry. Give me a second. So so, so lean. How did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet? 

Speaker 1 

So Caroline sent me the e-mail. I I think you have been. Also including the. Same e-mail so. I'm just. I think I'm just sharing it this slit communication. Can you see? That, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's exactly what I have. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. So I. So going back. To the question. Let's start here. For example, this would be category one, yeah? Category one and we have our question. And for that question, we have more answers in this survey. We don't have only yes, always, often or sometimes. There's also no. But and and so on so, but as long as they answer one of these. Responses they have been forced to do work against their will and back to the question, and that will be done weighted with 0.25. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, and. 

Speaker 3 

What do you mean weighted by 0.2? So it's like 0.25 times. 

Speaker 1 

0.0250.02. 

Speaker 2 

Five. So that's the proportion of the total index of 1. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk so that there was a sort of cumulative effect. So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding silly correctly when you. Look at this category. One silly that was designed to be those two questions together. Yeah. Can you see because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability? Yeah. So. That would give you a composite weighting. So if you answered the first question and in any of those responses you get point nought, 25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further point. Nought, 25, do you use the maximum? 

Speaker 1 

And this makes 0.05. Yeah, yeah, this is what I have done. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's super. So. 

Speaker 1 

As Caroline said, you have your two questions and. If the respondent our ID, our respondent has. Responded for. Responded for both of these questions. Then they will get a waiting for each 0.025 sum this would be. For this question 0.05 and that continues. So for all questions. So for here for example would be again 0.05. Here we have again. Two questions. So it will be 0.0250.025 if they have been out of that. Indicator for exploitation. Then they will get the weighting of 0.05 and this goes back. At the beginning so. Caroline has let waiting for all our questions in a way that pays 1st 0.35. Zero point. 55. And at the bottom. Is also 0.10 so. In total, this makes then one for 100% so percent. 

Speaker 2 

So that's what I sort of interrupt from our conversation last week. Scott, that's what I. Creatively designed and hoping that I've interpreted it properly. 

Speaker 3 

Gotcha. Thank you. Right. And then yes and then the the I don't want. So hang on. So it's category one category. So I don't want, I don't know how to describe this. So the different. So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't and differs across and. Just to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you you've selected those weights, not .35 for for category 13 and you've done that on qualitatively done on the basis of. 

Speaker 2 

I have some. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

The extent to which. You. You. 

Speaker 2 

Which indicates exploitation, serious exploitation, so that we've got that the middle block that Celine's got on the screen where and those are all indications of forced labour risk. And there's a sort of cumulative effect. So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk. 

Speaker 3 

Right it it. 

Speaker 2 

And so I've had allowed there were about eleven of those indicators. So it just made sense sort of mathematic arithmetically to to get a total of .55 those. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks for waiting, waiting. I think it's it. 

Speaker 2 

By assigning this these smaller weights to each composite measure, then in addition to. That we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is more objective measure of exploitation because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that, that person is experiencing expectation. So we've only got one question on that. It's actually that's a stronger indicator because it a flight, it's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that .35 on its own. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing explain. One which is this A which is at .1. So this is payment below the national living wage. So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be. It could be a exploitation, but it isn't always right. So that's why I've waited it at a. Lower level so. I could make a a narrative argument for why I've I've put those weightings in, but there's some convenience in making sure that they all add up to one, but there is some sort of a logic behind it. 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. Yeah. No, that makes. Yeah, that's great. So then just a few more follow up questions if I can. So the the. So category 12 is this is like you're saying, is like the suggestive. But not definitive indicator, but it gets a weight of not .1. Which is twice the weight of say category 11. 

Speaker 2 

It is. 

Speaker 3 

Right. Why that confuses me is is if it's if if if if category the 12 is the. Loosest, wouldn't we? Down. Weight it relative to the other categories. 

Speaker 2 

And with the other indicator, it can be illegal. I suppose that this this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially an illegal exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. OK, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Whereas excessive overtime. It's not necessarily illegal, I I agree, it's arguable. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

No, no. But I just, it's fine. It's fine. I just want. To make sure I'm understanding all the all the the. The not point fives and and sorry not point, not fives. Excuse me? And so so all the category. No, that's not true. All the categories in the middle block get not point not 5. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So there are 11 indicators of force labor and for each indicator, it's nought point nought, 5. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's where the not .55 comes from is because you're OK, good. Just one other question then in category 13. It's it's weighted, it's stated it's weighted at not .35, but it's also stated it's weighted at. Not .4. 

Speaker 2 

No, it is, isn't it? That's true. So one of those is wrong. So then which one did you use? Did you use the .35? 

Speaker 1 

I've done that with 0.35. 

Speaker 3 

OK, that's fine. That's fine. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So that's that's in typo. 

Speaker 3 

That's no problem. That's no problem. That's great. OK. No, no. So thank you. So now I understand this. So. 

Speaker 2 

My bad, OK. 

Speaker 3 

So now I'm. Able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is if I'm understanding it, do you do you want to combine categories? Is that what you're so? For example, we have? No, I said. Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

I think kilian's done it. I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these 13 categories. I'm right, aren't I? Celine? You have done it that way. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you can mind the questions. The yeah, which is. 

Speaker 2 

The indicators into third question. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. And we're, I'm. I'm totally comfortable with that is that? Do we need any other aggregation? 

Speaker 1 

Some some category. Sorry. I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one the same category? 

Speaker 2 

Now I'm happy with exactly I'm I'm happy with what you've done. I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures, but we do. So that's perfect. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. I'm. I'm, I'm. Happy with that if if you all are, I think that's I think that's great. Good, good. So and then for each of these we get, there's some distribution of this risk which is. Great, no problem. Good. Good. And there's no there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level is is there so. So for example combined categories, that's what I understood your question to be, Caroline. But now I say I I'm mistaken, that's not what you were saying. So sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ah, OK. You mean if there was? Evidence of low payment and forced labour and NRN. I mean we've got that in the. Summation, haven't we? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just you would just if you wanted higher levels of validation you would just add up those categories on their own. Yep, Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good. Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it, so that's great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. In a week as well. So thank you, Celine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, well done. Well done. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it yesterday. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's it's it looks great. It's like. I said this. Is totally spot on. We're we're looking for. 

Speaker 1 

What I'm seeing, Carla, I have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. Its weight was 0.4, so I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.3. 

Speaker 2 

Five. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Sorry, that's that's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't and obviously. 

Speaker 1 

I I'm saying so. Probably try. I just have to change whatever. Is written 0.040.35. And then just. Take everything together. This shouldn't take long, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And it's only category 13, so it's it's. Yeah, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't. Be too bad. 

Speaker 1 

It will impact some category but it. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's right, category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great, good, good. I still can't find the e-mail. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to? I get more coffee, sorry. 

Speaker 2 

OK. See if I can. And my screen. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we can't see. 

Speaker 3 

All right. 

Speaker 2 

It can. You see it? Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

N7 OK, papers right. Good. 

Speaker 2 

So we talked about the papers and and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that. 

Speaker 3 

That's. That's cool, right? So I started playing around so one so the the trimming so. Yeah. So uh boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee. OK, on on .1. There's there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So uhm. So. So in RDS the usually what's done is you're you're sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz. But everybody and your sample is is. Is in the in population and the objective is to calculate the size. Is the size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit and one of them is. This, and I don't know why they came up with this because but it's it's great for us is is a proportion estimate. So you could say, OK, here's this here's this hidden populate. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population and you want to know something about covariant. So for example you wanna know the HIV status among. IV drug users. So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you wanna know you wanna know proportion that are HIV positive say so. The point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us it's are you exposed so to to take one take one is there's some indicator. Where there's 12 indicators, whatever. And we So what I'm trying to say is is the. If we consider our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being, have you 01 have? Are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside notwithstanding, but there's a way then. Off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have this trait that are experiencing mass. So why is that sneaky that sneaky? So that's straightforward. We can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame. That we think are experiencing this. So it's kind of clever statistical trick where it might my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually know the. Answer to and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in, and I think this kind of fits in. That category so. So I take it as good news though. Like I said, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is different from us than the RDS world is we. We have ex. We have based on other sources, we have estimates I think. Of like for example the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think if so then we can do I mean estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear. But if so then we could. I'm trying to say is we could we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of. Domestic workers in the UK with the cell phone. Then we can we can. We can gin up a size estimate, so that's pretty cool. I think so. That's that's one thing. And that requires, like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon. Well, yeah, I could do that. This. Afternoon requires very little. Little little work. I mean, like I said, uncertainty estimates is going to be a bare, but we'll have to figure out that now the risk actually progress since I wrote this e-mail. So really I've been describing it is there's there's like a 01 your, your your HIV positive or you're not. But it turns out that the same methods actually applies for continuous variables. So we can do exactly the same thing with the Risk Index now. Here the news is. Not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what's the quantity of interest here? Because so normally we were what we want to know the size of section size, but with the risk index, we don't, I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, we don't. Care about like the total. We don't want a number. We don't want, like the sum of everyone's risk indices. I don't think I think. Instead what we want is the distribution. We want to know in the population. How is this risk distributed? Are there lots of people if I value, etc. Etcetera. So that would be ideally what we'd want and I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that. They'll give us numbers and confidence intervals. So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is. Lots of these. You're gonna hate me. So lots of these RDS methods that I've been playing. With our our. Our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything to anybody if? Not no problem. Bayesian so. 

Speaker 2 

Not much. I heard the term, but I don't know that. 

Speaker 3 

I am absolutely no problem. So so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistic. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or conference interval or whatever you can. Do hypothesis testing. Great, go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics. Like Bayesian, in which? Bayesian, say. Well, so let me put it in. So in the frequentist world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population. We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great. The bayesians say no, there's no such thing as truth. Doesn't exist. There's only belief and data, and I the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should. Adjust your beliefs in the presence of data. OK, so why do I? What am I addling on about this? I'm adding on about this because in the Bayesian world what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing. What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval. It's a shape. It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in in our world it would be not a size of the hidden population, it would be a distribution of how. Of our beliefs about the size of. The hidden population. That makes sense. 

Speaker 2 

I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. 

Speaker 3 

OK. It's it's really weird. I mean it's a very there are two very, very different ways of thinking about. The world and learning from data, basically. 

Speaker 2 

So is it a sort of? A variability graph is that what you would produce. 

Speaker 3 

What you would produce is is a distribution saying for each. Value. How likely? How confident are we the analyst? That the the size of the hidden population is 8500. There's some. There's some belief there's some probability that we have that the the size of hidden population is 8500 people, and there's some belief there's some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every for everything. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out of distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions, so the tractor split is we. If we use these Bayesian method. Leads to this RDS risk thing. What we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the not a distribution of the risk indices, but a distribution. For our beliefs. About the total, the sum of the risk indices. So it's saying a little treacherous, like it's a bit like before we could force a distribution, but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in. It's like the it's kind of like the difference between a sample distribution. So you've got a bunch of X's. And you can plot. Those or you could plot sample means, so take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two different distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not. And they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing. And so that's that's what I'm proposing is sort of. Is like. That is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not. I was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a there's one more paper I. Need to read. To before I ruled out the the. But but I mean, I think it's, I mean I think I think I see what we need and and I don't I'm not aware of methods that that do that. We want essentially we want, we want a different feature of the network than features of the network that people usually study, right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always, yeah. Prevalence size, what have you and that's fine. But we want other features of the network like. The distribution of this continuous covariant across across the network. 

Speaker 2 

It's sort of like a one step removed, like the mean is as as a measure of the. Some or population. Then the belief is a measure of confidence and I'm not really expressing. 

Speaker 3 

Is that the? 

Speaker 2 

It very well. 

Speaker 3 

No, no, you got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. And so that's exactly exactly that's why it's treacherous. Cause we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses. The variables whose. Distribution, we do want to come up with this thing, so. I don't really know. Like I said, it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics. And at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one. There's one other paper I need to check. Bear with me in network distribution. And please correct me if I'm wrong. If either you know anything about, you know Caroline, last week he corrected me when it was. And that was wonderful. Or two weeks ago, whatever it was. But that was great. So. So hopefully I'm. So anyway, so so so .2 is kind of a mix I guess. I don't really. I don't really know what to make of. .2 and I don't remember what point. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward de Bono has this idea of. Poe doesn't he and to? Me this seems like a. Poe, like Poe, it's a it's a. 

Speaker 3 

Wait, what's the code? 

Speaker 2 

Well, I I think about it as a a possibility. It could be it could be possible, but we we're sort of holding. It up as a. A possibility rather than a definite something that we know. We can do. So it's an opportunity to engage in this Bayesian discussion. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh I see, I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't remember. What .3 was, if there was a .3? I don't. Sorry I don't remember. 

Speaker 2 

Let me see if I can Scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see. My screen properly. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you. Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it again. I've made some. I've made more progress since I wrote this e-mail, but they're yeah, they keep. One of my laptop. 

Speaker 2 

I think. 

Speaker 3 

Keeps crash. Yeah, keeps crashing. So I've I've had to switch a bit, but I'm. I'm making some progress on that, which is which is, which is good, right. And then four. Right, right. So then. So I'm I'm I'm I'm. I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great, but then there's a sense in which. This is we sort. Of strayed, in a sense, and this is not a criticism of anybody. This is not a criticism of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh that was great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, lovely. Friday. Apologies for that. We we sort. Of strayed in in the following sense, at least when I. Started working with you all, which again is awesome. We're working from. Within the in some literature and trying to use Gsom and Feehan and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right. The techniques that we're describing here don't scale anything up. And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data and we have the. We could do scale up. It's just we don't have this representative sample and that. So we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the so normally. Non random sampling sort of. How do I say this? The usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But but here that's not the case. The the the, the, the. The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates, but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people. Or who? If you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers than other people, then OK, that sort of makes sense. That your your. Your estimate of the count is gonna be is gonna be OK. Right. So what? So what? So I was thinking like, well, OK, we can do 1-2 and three, but we're sort of we're leaving. Yeah, we've, we've, we've straight from the flock from the we're straight from the initial. And we're sort. Of we're leaving a lot of juicy information on the table, so is there. Is there any way that we can do this? And this is where. I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this, but I think there's a way that. I I think we can. So sorry, what I'm trying to say is. I think we can combine the two, so I and I think I see how. Again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear, but the idea is. Basically you use the ideas from RDS to. Use the ideas of. RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection. And I tried to write. Down the details, at least enough that would remind me of of of where to go in the future. But it's it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the. And and saw and sort of gluing them together and praying so again. 

Speaker 2 

For anyone else. That sounds absolutely fantastic and yeah. 

Speaker 3 

We'll see, but I think it's I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, we sort of come full circle in a way. This is what we were hoping that we would try. We'd start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because. 

Speaker 3 

Think it's worth trying. 

Speaker 2 

This won't work. Because this won't be and now. Possibly, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I mean another nice I I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree. Is that what I'm proposing here is we'll get oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see is there consistency, is there not is there. You have all these different methods to throw at this problem and. Personally, I think that's a I think it's informative either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates, that's reassuring in a certain sense. And if they don't, that's informative. That's telling you something about it about this. So I think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without detractors. But I'm. I'm. I'm a I think I think that's. On balance, I think that's good news. So that's my report, which isn't. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really, really exciting. So that that's fantastic. If we think that that we might be able to circle back to real estate, Newsome using some of the and then to sell great. Yeah, that's great. 

Speaker 3 

That's that's the idea. That's the idea. I mean. Yeah, let's say I'll try it out the I'll try it out. I'll. Try it out, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And I suppose our. Our ground, our foundation, is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so. Even if this yeah, more advanced work. Doesn't reveal what we want it to. We've got a when we're talking about originally about the what we really wanted was some sort of estimate of this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Again with with the caveat which. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it's an important caveat that the thing we're estimating is a proportion or not a count. But yeah, with that, with that caveat, we're we're solid. We're very, very solid. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Now I I was reading a paper which which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up. And and yeah, that's. That's great. I mean this, I'm. Gonna ask a really stupid question now. But if we have a proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size, can we not produce a scale up? 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. So that's right. Exactly. So we absolutely can we like if we if we want a number we can produce a number, there's two. Here's a pro. Here's a con. The Pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of. Cuz 1 sample. I mean again, there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better. So if there's other sources of data that we can incorporate, that's great. That's the pro the con is. Reflecting uncertainty in that world. I'll have to think about because. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Unless we had, like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then. Then there's uncertainty in that estimate, and I it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty. It's gotta be possible. I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee. But yeah, exactly. If if we if we want a number. 

Speaker 2 

No. OK. 

Speaker 3 

We can get a number. 

Speaker 2 

We just be. Yeah, it wouldn't be that. 

Speaker 3 

Confidence is something. Yeah. It would be tough to it. It would just be and we could just report that. I mean, we could just say, look, here's here's the estimate. There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty. And we can't for the other. 

Speaker 2 

It could be that confidence in that number. 

Speaker 3 

And here's it would just be upfront about it and say or even more straightforward. Here's our point estimate. And because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry. So take it or leave it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. But the and you tell me, Caroline, from, like, a policy perspective or impact perspective is I would say that a. Proportion would be. I mean, I know like at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from the Home Office is that. At the government level, they they do want numbers they want. Counts but it. I would say that a proportion would be of use question mark or. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so, yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at the. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Moment at the. Moment, we've just got descriptive statistics, so to have a proportion is a real step forward. 

Speaker 1 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. I can. I will. Yeah, I will get another couple. I will do that this afternoon actually. 

Speaker 2 

That would be fantastic. That. No, that's really, really good. Do you need anything? More from us, Scott at this stage. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Can you write my lecture slides for next week, please? That's the number one thing I need. Seriously with this. No. Well, just when you get to category 13 saying fixed up, which is I'm not worried about it. It's trivial. Just send it around again and I'll. 

Speaker 1 

I will. I will do it after the meeting. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. That's great. And and. Take long. No, it shouldn't. And I will. Yeah, yeah, I'll do the. I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon, at least I'll try to and see what comes out, and then I'm afraid we have to park it again because teaching is gonna be. 

Speaker 

No, but I. 

Speaker 2 

Think we've really made some good progress here and I've got. I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft. Stop the I've been making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using, so I want to consolidate that into the draft and I can share that with you. So that will be in a couple of weeks time and but I've got some time, but. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. That's a great idea. Oh, no, no, no, that's no rush. No rush. On my end please. 

Speaker 2 

Time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. We're in a position where we can start to do that. 

Speaker 3 

I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think. I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really, if I. I mean I I don't know this literature as well as they all do, but but it seems like. There's a possibility to make a real contribution, I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, very. Yeah, that is good. Yeah. Yeah, really good. 

Speaker 3 

Very cool. 

Speaker 2 

Right. Well, given that you've got exercises, I'm not proposing to detain. Yeah, you don't get any longer than we have to and slim with everything. Else from your side that we needed to cover. 

Speaker 1 

Today, I mean, there's just the categories that I've not done, I have to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that. My deliberate mistake. 

Speaker 1 

I I can also pay more attention to it. So I I will. Clean up the categories 13 and then recalculate the sum category and then share it with. Dispose of you and yeah. Is there anything else that I can help with? Doctor Moser? 

Speaker 3 

Let me I'm just looking at the. Right now, as long as I've got the node one and the node 2, that's important. Now it looks like the what's weather exploitation. You've mentioned a new e-mail type of. 

Speaker 1 

Whether they have been, but whether they have because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some fame, right? Right. OK. Thank you. Thank you. So. 

Speaker 1 

By looking at that. It's that. They are all exploited some degree. 

Speaker 3 

Got you. Right, which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got. The Yep. Nope. Bye. Ohh well there is one of them. I think we've already covered it. And that is what are the. It it if I'm gonna do that? Yeah, there is one. Very important thing. Thank you for. Thank you for that, Caroline. It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think book is set would be great, but which? If I wanted to dichotomize and say yes, you're in experiencing modern slavery. No, you're not. What questions? Plural, would I? What question should I use and and if there's more than one question, that's fine. Which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM. Seems like a pretty gold standard. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's good. So they got and the forced labour ones as well are more indicative of forced of once slavery. It's that last the point. 11 which is it potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labour? Not necessarily modern slavery, so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator, they they could be exploited. It's labour exploitation, but it isn't. It isn't modern slavery. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's Q 36 five B1? And so I should use that one. And the NRM. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the only one is definitely well, as definitely as. You can be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Within our data, modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, good point. And the 2 * 2. Anything else? Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable? 

Speaker 2 

Not that I can think of. Still him. Have you got any anything you want to? Mention anything common? Use. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I I'm looking at the. Document I I don't think so. 

Speaker 3 

OK, great. Good. Makes my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. OK. Thanks. Thanks as always everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, brilliant. Do you want to meet next week or give it? When do you want to? Catch up again. 

Speaker 3 

Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so. Sorry, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Are you around next Friday today? 

Speaker 1 

I for the next two weeks until the 22nd I might be not. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Because my annual review is coming up. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'm. I'm in the process of. Putting everything together. 

Speaker 2 

Right, OK, now that's fine. So it would be as well to have well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again. Probably at the beginning of December, when is your annual review. 

Speaker 

I can't. 

Speaker 1 

On the 28. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

The 28th, so the beginning. Of December would be aware. 

Speaker 1 

29 or 29th of November. Any day off on that one? 

Speaker 2 

Right. OK. 

Speaker 1 

3rd of December, since it's a Friday, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Is that a Friday again? Let me find my calendar too. 

Speaker 3 

Sorry about that. Fire alarm business. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh OK, so we're suggesting Scott. Perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the 1st of December. 

Speaker 3 

That works just if you don't mind sending me a team invite. That would be that would be great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, and and 12:00, is that still a good time? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I'm flexible, so whatever. If another time works better for you. All that's that's fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

That's alright for me. What about you, silly? 

Speaker 1 

11 or 12 is fine. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's go for 11, then I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft. So we've got some probably in the week before whatever stage it's in. I'll circulate it and and then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well. 

Speaker 1 

No. Ohh good. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

Sounds great. Thanks everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, good. Good to speak to. You thank you getting fire alarm sorted out, OK. 

Speaker 3 

All have a nice weekend. Yeah, me too. Talk to you later and you. Thank you. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Have a good weekend.
