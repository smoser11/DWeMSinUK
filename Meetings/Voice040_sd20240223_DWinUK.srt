1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, all good. Thank you. Good. Just discussing the some question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns. Yeah.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It just never ends. It's just, it's just, yeah. Anyway.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We feel your pain from the previous term.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to college. It seems that you're in the majority of Carolina that at least among people I talked to that this term is the heavy term compared to last term.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. And I'm very glad mine is over so or yeah, you know.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, so I saw your email Scott say thank you for prompting us. I think we still even I would just discussing the like a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That won't really help us.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But so there are two issues that the clean data that you need to be able to do anything.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are those the two main issues for you?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, that's exactly right. And for whatever it's worth. I feel like we're really close.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But yeah, that's that's exactly right, Caroline.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So Dr. Moses, you have sent me last time and you taught me to do that bootstrapping.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And so I also told us to Caroline. Yeah.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When we're waiting. I didn't do anything. That's okay.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
When I saw your Tuesday, I said to you, I will send you something. Yeah, but I couldn't get. Yeah.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person like me and you so that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, I will be on Monday on campus. Would you have time then to Monday?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon three or four.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can you do before 1pm or before noon?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1pm. I think hang on.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't do it 1pm until 2pm and then from 3pm until 4pm and then from 5pm until 6pm.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So I could do from 1pm until no from I could do from 2pm until 3pm.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
2pm should work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that should work.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On Monday. Yeah.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you mind sending me a team's invite? We can meet where we can meet my office, your office, coffee.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We can meet in your office. That's fine. That's fine.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But the main thing, the most urgent thing I think is this data issues is the, I just don't understand what's, did my question make sense or am I just confused?

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Which question? Yeah, exactly. Right. My question about the, about the data and the code books.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You asked something about the code book and I think the code book that I had sent in end of November, beginning of end of November, this is also the latest one.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, good.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This should be the most recent updated code book that we have. Good.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And then you had also a question about the referrals to phone numbers, 10 or 5.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, it's, well, yeah, yeah, because the data, yeah, exactly.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, so for that is, in our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or 10, but we said we will only accept up to five.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, just the first thing. Okay.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Second information is, even if people have referred, let's say, seven people, five, it does mean they have been successful.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, of course, right, of course. So that's why, in order to understand how many referrals we had eventually, we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID, and at the wave, so that we can identify which I, which person ID recruiter has successfully recruited or referred people.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I got that. And of course, really, the successful recruit referrals aren't the same as referrals, and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The issue is really just one of variables.

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It looks like some people refer up to nine people, and that's, or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Up to 10, yeah. But then there are these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be three phone numbers, and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So on the survey, people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone, and some other people could only refer three or four people.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That doesn't explain the gap.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let me share my screen if you don't mind, and probably easier to just look at it.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I have to figure out how to share my name screen. Let's try that. Hopefully that's working. Can you see my Excel?

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah.

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
These are great examples.

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, so first let me pop over to the code book, and there's no coding after Q90.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:05,000
My understanding is that Q105 here, up to Q110, were the referrals that were used. So those were the coupons that were given.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And then you've got this person who refers nine people. That's fine. That makes sense. But look at this person.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This person refers three phone numbers, and then they refer six nothings, and then there's a phone number way over here.

53
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Or take this person. Their Q105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I just don't understand how this happens.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

55
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So for starters, is my understanding correct that this is the possible set of phone numbers?

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five, that we don't actually give the coupons, and that's great.

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And that's actually super helpful.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But the reason I'm asking is because at our last meeting, we had this observation. I think Caroline had a great suggestion.

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should fix that up. And that's right.

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then I was thinking, well, hang on. That logic applies to everybody.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So if you say you know two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give five phone numbers, that same logic applies.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And we should still fix up that number.

64
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And I, like, so for this row, what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is it four?

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or can we not tell?

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In that case that you have highlighted before.

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, good. Thank you.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, that's excellent. That's what I understand. And so and likewise, so this for this row, the number would be nine.

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, nine.

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, so basically I shouldn't worry about the or the gaps or the ordering.

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think you shouldn't worry about gaps in between the phone number referrals.

73
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the printed survey from the just system.

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
People were filled out.

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wonderful. Yes. Thank you. That's that's super wonderful.

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But now even even this conversation is super helpful because now I know the the number of phone numbers that a person gave.

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And that was the missing piece that I was I was.

79
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess, but but so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can.

80
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, I'm going to take this off.

81
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And and that's great news. Thank you. I will.

82
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How do I stop? I will.

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff.

84
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're we're we're we're virtually ready to go. Oh, oh, the population estimate. Yes, Caroline, what were your thoughts on on that?

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So I've been tracking the Europeans on this and they have a category that they call personal household services PHS.

86
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And they've started to collect data on this.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And it comprises two elements.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So there's the just jotted down the details that I found.

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And they work without accommodation, which has a NAC code 88. And then they have an activities of households as employees of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now that is also a sick code for the UK, this activities. So that's very closely linked to domestic workers that second one is tightly bounded.

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
An analysis that included UK figures from 2017. So it's not too far away.

92
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. Yeah. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000 respectively.

93
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The social work without accommodation is that bigger figure. And then the activities of households as employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure.

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Excellent. So the paper, they've got some trends for other countries and they, I mean, I think we could make an argument that they're broadly static.

95
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, if you're saying we're not very sensitive.

96
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

97
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So the question then is, for us, do we want to combine them to have this that gives you the one million figure that I think, or roughly a million, or do we want to take this smaller lower number of 51,000 that's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
number is larger than that. It's 79,000.

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So.

100
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So hang on. I think I misread you. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000.

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
929,000.

102
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, wow. Okay. My mistake.

103
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And what were the codes again? I'm sorry. NEC? I don't know this.

104
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
N-A-C-E. I don't know what it stands for. But N-A-C-E-88.

105
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

106
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an email. So,

107
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's all right. And N-A-C-E-97, which is this activities of households as employers of domestic personnel.

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I think that probably can now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through Eurostat and try and pull out something more recent. But if, yeah, that's what I was hoping.

110
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I agree.

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

112
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range.

113
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
From we've got lower and upper limits, haven't we?

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

116
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah.

117
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But perhaps is the most.

118
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yep. I think that's a great idea.

119
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Conservative approach.

120
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes. I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the, the, I don't know what I'm sorry. I don't know where the 1.7 million came from.

121
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The, it's really, it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all.

122
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I haven't played with things as small as 50, 51,000. But I will. And I think you're right. I think the range, I think we say, you know, here's the number that we're using site, site, site.

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In the appendix, here's the robot, here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change. And I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said, it was like from 900 to a million to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher, like nothing changes.

124
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, so I, and I don't know about the lower. So I'll, but I'll play with this. So I think this is, please don't spend any more time on, I mean, please do save the citation.

125
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We can, we can, you know, site the site the site.

126
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've got, yeah, I've logged it across in an email to you.

127
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really? What I've just told you now. So we've got, we've got the link to the numbers.

128
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Good. Okay. Well, I can, I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon.

129
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Should we meet next week or if, if Selene can get the, well, that's not entirely off.

130
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can have, I can have everything except the in some polished by next Friday and depending on how our meeting goes on Monday, Selene. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer. I don't know.

131
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But, but, but, but the, just from the, just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure.

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay. Would a three o'clock meeting next week be all right?

133
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Sure.

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I've got something in for two.

135
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No problem.

136
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Already.

137
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

138
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Does that work for you, Selene?

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, as long as it's after afternoon is fine.

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah. So we said three.

141
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, it's fine for me.

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll send something across.

143
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I also sent a meeting link.

144
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thank you.

145
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

146
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah.

147
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And so how, how do you, how should I prepare for this meeting? What are you?

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah.

149
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions. Yeah.

150
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And some small questions.

151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So that's fine.

152
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can guide me.

153
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sure.

154
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So you don't need to prepare anything.

155
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Just about that.

156
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay. Okay.

157
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He said, he said, okay.

158
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
All right.

159
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All right.

160
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Sounds good.

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And thanks for, like I said, this was.

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is very helpful for me.

163
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So thanks.

164
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's great.

165
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

166
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, it's just, it just is tantalizing now, isn't it?

167
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Cause it was, I think we, we get it.

168
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
As you say, we're getting close.

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So close.

170
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's really just, just delivering now.

171
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah.

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I didn't mean it critically, Selene.

174
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Not at all.

175
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And in fact, I was, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, I'm not saying anything critical.

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's just, I, I, I'm with Caroline.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like we just, let's get it done.

179
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's get it done.

180
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We can, we can, we can do it.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So thanks.

182
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thanks so much.

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I hope you have.

184
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Find some time to enjoy the weekend.

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And we'll talk in a week.

186
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000

Thank you.

194
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't care.

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.

197
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Jimmie crack corn but I don't care.

198
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
My master's gone away.

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's the lyric.

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay.

202
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Here we go again.

203
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Same French guy.

204
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
All right, sir.
