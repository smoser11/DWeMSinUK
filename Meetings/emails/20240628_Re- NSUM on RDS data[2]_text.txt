Hi Scott,

I hope that the R&R is now put to bed and that you have been able to make some headway with the intransigent RDS/NSUM issue.

As I said, I am taking some annual leave - returning 18 July. If I don't hear from you in the meantime, I'll drop you a line when I return.

Really looking forward to seeing all the work that you've done on this come together. I so appreciate your support and expertise with this.

Best wishes for a good summer,

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I hope you are enjoying your summer!  I have *not* forgotten about our paper, and have â€˜poked at itâ€™ a little in the past few weeks.  I have an R&R deadline I need to address first, and Iâ€™m out of town most of next week.  If you donâ€™t hear back from me by Friday next, may I please invite you to â€˜pingâ€™ me?  Oddly, I still have not resolved the â€˜minor technicalâ€™ issue I was having ages ago.

 

I am excited to finish this off, see the results and get is polished!  Thank you again for working with me ðŸ˜Š

Best,

Scott
