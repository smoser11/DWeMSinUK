Dear Caroline,

Please don't hate me, but can we postpone our RDS catchup meeting scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) am, please?  I have been working on it, and have essentially 'caught myself' up from our past meetings.  I have also managed to suffer a bad IT failure and currently cannot locate the  estimations and work preformed last term.  so sorry!

How is your monday?  11am?

Stay warm and happy 2024!

That's excellent Selim, thank you. I shall read your additions. I suggest that Scott and I meet up as planned on Monday, but that we schedule our next meeting at a time that is convenient for you too.

I'll send a further meeting request once we have an agreed date and time.

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline, 

Thank you for your email.

I have some updates regarding the paper. I will be in Germany next week, so I will not be able to attend the meeting on Monday. Alternatively, I can meet on the 25th or 26th of January again.

Please see attached the updated paper draft, I have added an updated graph with some writing in the section of the network. In the new graph, I have indicated respondents from each wave for clarity. I hope you like it, and please let me know if you want me to add anything else.

In the meantime, I have noted down a task to check the high estimates of modern slavery. I think the descriptive statistics show a similarly high percentage of exploitation among respondents. I have listed some examples of questions in the attachment.

Thank you, and please let me know what you think.

With kind regards,

Selim Yilmaz

Subject: Re: Meeting this morning 
 
Dear Caroline,

I am most sorry to have missed our Monday meeting.  I was jetlagged, preparing for further travel, and simply 'wimped out.'  Here is a (two part... doh!) video in my attempt to 'catch up' on our research.

Part 1 (15 mins): Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUp1.webm
Part 2 (15 mins):Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUp2.webm

It gets a bit rambling at times so here is an outline based on the transcript in the hopes it is of some help.  I think our next step is to settle on the next steps (HA!)

### Organized Outline of the Transcript

#### 1. Introduction
   - **Context:** Scott's apology for missing the Monday meeting.
   - **Purpose:** Sending a recording to update Carolyn on the progress due to poor typing and spelling skills.

#### 2. Conceptualization and Measurement
   - **Population Definition:** Domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones during survey fielding.
   - **Target Population:** Domestic workers in the UK who have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months.
   - **Operationalization of 'Hidden Population':**
     - Dichotomous measures: Payment below legal minimum wage and referral to the national referral mechanism.
     - Continuous measure: Risk of experiencing modern slavery based on various indicators.

#### 3. Sampling Methodology
   - **Data Source:** RDS (Respondent-Driven Sampling) sample of domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones.
   - **Subgroups within Sample:** Clusters based on nationality (Philippines, Latinx, British born).

#### 4. Data Issues and Estimation
   - **Population Estimates:** Using survey data to estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK.
   - **RDS Data Utilization:** Using techniques from Gile et al. for successive sampling population size estimates.
   - **Robustness of Analysis:** Exploring robustness to different priors and sample sizes.

#### 5. Analysis Strategy
   - **RDS Estimation:** Discussion on the off-the-shelf RDS method and SSPS (Successive Sampling Population Size Estimates).
   - **Disaggregating by Origin:** Potential for separate analysis of different nationality clusters.
   - **Estimation Challenges:** Issues with zeros in the data and social network information.

#### 6. Integration of RDS and NSUM Methods
   - **Combining Techniques:** Exploring the possibility of integrating RDS weights with NSUM (Non-Sampling Error and Unit-level Measurement Error) methods for more powerful analysis.

#### 7. Presentation and Discussion
   - **Data Presentation:** Deciding on the format (tables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian posterior series).
   - **Further Discussion Points:** Need for more discussion to guide presentation choices.

#### 8. Conclusion
   - **Recap:** Summary of the discussed points and apology for any confusion caused by the message format.

Thanks for this and I completely understand re: teaching prep.  As we noted in the Autumn, you and I are having 'opposite' semesters in terms of teaching work load 🙁
Yes lets please meet in late Jan (25?26?  whatever is best for you both) to touch base and give me more 'homework'.
Stay warm,

Subject: Meeting this week?

Hi Scott, 

I am half-way through listening to your videos. I note already that the clarity you provide about separating out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk mean that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

I hear also that you are making good progress  working out technically how we may be able to use the RDS/convenience sample to estimate the size of the domestic worker population. I don't exactly follow this, but what you've said seems to sound promising.

I know that you suggested meeting up either Thurs 25 or Fri 26th. Selim, could you please indicate your availability so that Scott can pick a suitable time (I am available anytime except between 2-3 on Thursday or 4-5 on Friday).

I'll see if I can listen to the second video now.

Best wishes
Caroline

Thanks for these details about your availability, Selim. Taking a look at my schedule, it seems that the best days for our subsequent meeting would be either Tuesday or Friday. Scott, do you want to suggest a time?

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline,

Thank you for your email, and I apologise for the delay in my reply.

I am available anytime except Mondays and Thursdays starting next week. At the moment, I am overloaded with marking and preparing the delivery of a lecture. Please let me know when you have arranged to meet next and I will join the conversation.

In the meantime, please update me if there is anything else that I could help with.

Thank you.

With kind regards,

Hi Scott, 

I am half-way through listening to your videos. I note already that the clarity you provide about separating out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk mean that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

I hear also that you are making good progress  working out technically how we may be able to use the RDS/convenience sample to estimate the size of the domestic worker population. I don't exactly follow this, but what you've said seems to sound promising.

I know that you suggested meeting up either Thurs 25 or Fri 26th. Selim, could you please indicate your availability so that Scott can pick a suitable time (I am available anytime except between 2-3 on Thursday or 4-5 on Friday).

I'll see if I can listen to the second video now.

Best wishes
Caroline

Book time to meet with me

Date: 20240202
Subject: For Today's meeting

Hi Scott,

Here are the headlines that I garnered from your exceptionally helpful videos;

Conceptually we probably need to separate out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk meaning that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

Data cleaning: we need to modify how we have dealt with the 'don't knows'. We need a separate category code for these throughout the data - perhaps labelled as 'missing'?
There are some DWs  (about 17) who, although they claim not to know any other DWs later make referrals. We need to decide how to deal with these responses. Suggested options a) remove them from the analysis b) identify an alternative statistical technique c) turn zeros into 1s -by for example, adding +1 to everyone.
You are disaggregating the sample by origin: LA, Filipino and British born
Data issues - what is the UK DW population? Population estimates vary on sites such as National careers and BICS. You are exploring how to estimate this from our RDS sample based on 'how many others do you know' (Gile 2010, 2011).
Analysis: you have currently used Giles and a new RDS technique called Successive Sampling Population Size (SSPS) estimation, including a 2023 paper which adjusts for measurement error. This is an improvement on RDS1 and RDS2 and can be used for estimation to provide a proportional measure of Q36 and Q80 in the population that can then be compared with population size. 
There may be the opportunity for a third approach - an alternative to this off the shelf RDS - which could utilise our NSUM data. This would be more powerful, since it uses more information. The problem that requires a solution is that we do not have a random sample, so need 'inclusion probability' weights. The good news is that it is straightforward to derive these weights from RDS and these can then be used within NSUM estimators
Work still to do: 
(Scott) Bootstraps; sensitivity analysis; carry out NSUM &RDS calculations; (all of us) What do we want to present and how? What tables, graphs, confidence intervals and Bayesian stats are needed? Not yet ready to produce publication graphics.

Other things I noted from what you said
current estimates suggest the proportional figure is ~30-40%. 
current estimators show good convergence
work still to be carried out includes: sensitivity analysis 
I think we should also talk about perhaps a shift in emphasis perhaps speaking to a broader scope of labour exploitation, for which the failure to be paid the NLW (Q36) and evidence of Modern Slavery (Q80)  provide 2 concrete markers on a spectrum of exploitation.

I hope this will help us structure today's meeting.

Best wishes
Caroline

Subject: Re: For Today's meeting

Notes from today's meeting

Caroline will revise the composite risk index and send to Selim for recalculation of the index.
'Don't knows' recoded as missing. By coding people who don't know as not experiencing exploitation - our estimate is conservative.
3. What to do with the true zeros? Take out 'true ones'. This is a limitation of the estimating technique. For the ones nomination, correcting to the data to state that they have other DWs in their networks. Assigning a value to the network that is the smallest possible value for logical consistency.

4. Could estimation be performed separately by group. This is possible for the Filipino group - perhaps test this in comparison to the group of a whole to see if there is something

5. Domestic worker population size. For RDS estimation need a prior belief of the population size of domestic workers in the UK. Could be a range. Taking estimates, and increasing them by orders of magnitude. Estimates are relatively insensitive, but will need to settle on one. Could use ODW visa numbers, we know this is an underestimation, but could include sensitivity analysis as an appendix. 

6. This is all great. Many related RDS methods, pick one for presentation purposes and include others in the appendices. Similarity of estimates may be an indication of robustness. Reasons for picking the one we do. Currently 2 front runners - both easy to justify, but need to decide which one to pick (Scott).

7. This is an exciting opportunity:  Selim will look in to supporting this with R coding of the bootstrapping procedure. Scott will share the paper again.

Diagrams and tables for explanatory process - relevant to publication outlet and possible reviewers - e.g. Clifford Zines and Kysia Kyle (?) at NORC, University of Chicago.

Fab-u-lous!

Subject: For Today's meeting 
 
Hi Scott,

Here are the headlines that I garnered from your exceptionally helpful videos;

Conceptually we probably need to separate out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk meaning that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

Data cleaning: we need to modify how we have dealt with the 'don't knows'. We need a separate category code for these throughout the data - perhaps labelled as 'missing'?
There are some DWs  (about 17) who, although they claim not to know any other DWs later make referrals. We need to decide how to deal with these responses. Suggested options a) remove them from the analysis b) identify an alternative statistical technique c) turn zeros into 1s -by for example, adding +1 to everyone.
You are disaggregating the sample by origin: LA, Filipino and British born
Data issues - what is the UK DW population? Population estimates vary on sites such as National careers and BICS. You are exploring how to estimate this from our RDS sample based on 'how many others do you know' (Gile 2010, 2011).
Analysis: you have currently used Giles and a new RDS technique called Successive Sampling Population Size (SSPS) estimation, including a 2023 paper which adjusts for measurement error. This is an improvement on RDS1 and RDS2 and can be used for estimation to provide a proportional measure of Q36 and Q80 in the population that can then be compared with population size. 
There may be the opportunity for a third approach - an alternative to this off the shelf RDS - which could utilise our NSUM data. This would be more powerful, since it uses more information. The problem that requires a solution is that we do not have a random sample, so need 'inclusion probability' weights. The good news is that it is straightforward to derive these weights from RDS and these can then be used within NSUM estimators
Work still to do: 
(Scott) Bootstraps; sensitivity analysis; carry out NSUM &RDS calculations; (all of us) What do we want to present and how? What tables, graphs, confidence intervals and Bayesian stats are needed? Not yet ready to produce publication graphics.

Other things I noted from what you said
current estimates suggest the proportional figure is ~30-40%. 
current estimators show good convergence
work still to be carried out includes: sensitivity analysis 
I think we should also talk about perhaps a shift in emphasis perhaps speaking to a broader scope of labour exploitation, for which the failure to be paid the NLW (Q36) and evidence of Modern Slavery (Q80)  provide 2 concrete markers on a spectrum of exploitation.

I hope this will help us structure today's meeting.

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline,

Thank you for your email, and I apologise for the delay in my reply.

I am available anytime except Mondays and Thursdays starting next week. At the moment, I am overloaded with marking and preparing the delivery of a lecture. Please let me know when you have arranged to meet next and I will join the conversation.

In the meantime, please update me if there is anything else that I could help with.

Thank you.

Hi Scott, 

I am half-way through listening to your videos. I note already that the clarity you provide about separating out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk mean that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

I hear also that you are making good progress  working out technically how we may be able to use the RDS/convenience sample to estimate the size of the domestic worker population. I don't exactly follow this, but what you've said seems to sound promising.

I know that you suggested meeting up either Thurs 25 or Fri 26th. Selim, could you please indicate your availability so that Scott can pick a suitable time (I am available anytime except between 2-3 on Thursday or 4-5 on Friday).

I'll see if I can listen to the second video now.

Best wishes

Dear both,
Thank you for a wonderful – and mind-expanding – meeting on Friday!  I hope you have enjoyed your respective weekends. 

Some scattered thoughts: (1) is there an acronym I should be using in meials to refer to this paper?  I'm thinking 'DWinUK' (= domestic workers in the UK) or perhaps with a 'experiencing exploitation' (+EE?)

(2) What I thought would be an two-hour side project has turned into a bit of a small creature, regarding the data we are using. 
I am trying to 'clean' the data, specifically adjust the 'personal network size' (q13) in light of the number of referrals a person made, as we discussed on Friday.   Turns out I have loads more questions about the data (sorry, Selim!).  To wit, please consider the attached file, `DWinUK_data.csv`, which is exactly the  file `Further Coding Update.xlsx` just with 'clean'variable names.  I am confused about the way the questions are recorded as variables.  For example, I originally thought that​ (A) the variables q105​ to q110​ contained the (up-to) five referrals (the 'coupons' in RDS language).  However, upon closer inspection, it seems that (B ) perhaps the variables q105​ to q115​ might contain the mobile numbers of referals (see ID 13, row 11 in the CSV file).  HOWEVER, however, (C)  ID 14 (row 12) seems to thwart this interpretation, because this person seems to have nominated three other DWs (
7575744493
7309055303
7366528118
in vars q105, q106, q107 respectively), but then there is also a mobile number in q115 (mobile = 7823598150).  So, did this person nominate three people?  Or four?

If interpretation (B ) is correct, then subjects could nominate up to 10 others, not five as I had been thinking.  Please help clarify.  Also also, there are two codebooks (attached) – which should I be using? 
Thanks, I am looking forward to making headway on this.

RE: Domestic Worker population in the UK
I've had a quick scan through the references that google thinks that I may find interesting on this and have come up with what could be a useful starting point from WIEGO https://www.wiego.org/sites/default/files/publications/file/WIEGO_Statistical_Brief_N32_DWs%20in%20the%20World.pdf

This brief summarises country statistics from the ILOSTAT database, giving a headline figure for Europe of 2.5 million.

Is this a database that you're familiar with, or would you like me to see if I can dig out a UK or even an England figure?

Best wishes

Howdy all. 

 

I wanted to follow up on out DWinUK paper.  I feel like we are close, but I also feel like I do not want to loose the ‘momentum’ we have.  On my end, I think I only need the answers to my previous email to finish off the RDS analysis.  I do still need to work on the NSUM analysis (more on this below).

 

  Selim: are you able to help with answers regarding the data set?  Specifically about Q105 to Q110/ Q115?  And the two versions of the Codebook?  I really need to comprehend the ‘referrals’ (=’coupons’) parameters and data.

 

Selim: at our last meeting we talked about you working on implementing the ‘neighbour bootstrap.’  I attach the paper and the CRAN links -- < https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Neighboot/index.html > to help you get started.  I will work on the NSUM part. 


Caroline: As you know, we need a ‘prior belief’ about the size of the population from which we are sampling, e.g. the number of Domestic Workers in the UK.  I had mentioned that I noodled around and came up with a very rough estimate that of 1.74 million DW in the UK.   I confess I cannot find the exact source of that guestimate. Indeed, it seems that perhaps that was an overestimate:

(see also the attached).

 

I do hope we can move forward on this paper soon.  Please do let me know if I can help facilitate.

Even 1- 1.5 million seems a bit high. There are 30 European countries listed that seem to comprise the wiego 'Europe' figure of 2.5 million. Taking a simple average gives a figure of around 83,000. I could try a weighted average - but perhaps we are looking more in the region of 100,000 rather than 1,000,000?

Thanks so much for the ultra-prompt reply, Caroline!

Yes, we will need a reasonable guess for the number of Domestic Workers (DW) in the UK (technically, "with a mobile number, during the time frame in which your survey was fielded" – but IM' not super bothered by these very particular details). Coming up with a figure is surprisingly difficult.  It looks like my initial 'guess' of 1.74 mil. is a bit high: perhaps 1 mil to 1.5 mil?  We can of course perform sensitivity analysis regarding this figure.  My initial explorations indicate that once the size of the population (= DW in the UK) is about 1 mil., our resulting/ outputted estimates dont' really change that much. 
I hope that makes sense. And that it helps (?)
Have a great weekend!

This brief summarises country statistics from the ILOSTAT database, giving a headline figure for Europe of 2.5 million.

Is this a database that you're familiar with, or would you like me to see if I can dig out a UK or even an England figure?

Best wishes
Caroline

Subject: Re: DWinUK data 
 
Howdy all. 

 

I wanted to follow up on out DWinUK paper.  I feel like we are close, but I also feel like I do not want to loose the ‘momentum’ we have.  On my end, I think I only need the answers to my previous email to finish off the RDS analysis.  I do still need to work on the NSUM analysis (more on this below).

 

  Selim: are you able to help with answers regarding the data set?  Specifically about Q105 to Q110/ Q115?  And the two versions of the Codebook?  I really need to comprehend the ‘referrals’ (=’coupons’) parameters and data.

 

Selim: at our last meeting we talked about you working on implementing the ‘neighbour bootstrap.’  I attach the paper and the CRAN links -- < https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Neighboot/index.html > to help you get started.  I will work on the NSUM part. 


Caroline: As you know, we need a ‘prior belief’ about the size of the population from which we are sampling, e.g. the number of Domestic Workers in the UK.  I had mentioned that I noodled around and came up with a very rough estimate that of 1.74 million DW in the UK.   I confess I cannot find the exact source of that guestimate. Indeed, it seems that perhaps that was an overestimate:

https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/homeworkingintheukregionalpatterns/2019to2022


(see also the attached).

 

I do hope we can move forward on this paper soon.  Please do let me know if I can help facilitate.

Best,

Scott

Subject: DWinUK data 

 

Dear both,

Thank you for a wonderful – and mind-expanding – meeting on Friday!  I hope you have enjoyed your respective weekends. 

 

Some scattered thoughts: (1) is there an acronym I should be using in meials to refer to this paper?  I'm thinking 'DWinUK' (= domestic workers in the UK) or perhaps with a 'experiencing exploitation' (+EE?)

 

(2) What I thought would be an two-hour side project has turned into a bit of a small creature, regarding the data we are using. 

I am trying to 'clean' the data, specifically adjust the 'personal network size' (q13) in light of the number of referrals a person made, as we discussed on Friday.   Turns out I have loads more questions about the data (sorry, Selim!).  To wit, please consider the attached file, `DWinUK_data.csv`, which is exactly the  file `Further Coding Update.xlsx` just with 'clean'variable names.  I am confused about the way the questions are recorded as variables.  For example, I originally thought that​ (A) the variables q105​ to q110​ contained the (up-to) five referrals (the 'coupons' in RDS language).  However, upon closer inspection, it seems that (B ) perhaps the variables q105​ to q115​ might contain the mobile numbers of referals (see ID 13, row 11 in the CSV file).  HOWEVER, however, (C)  ID 14 (row 12) seems to thwart this interpretation, because this person seems to have nominated three other DWs (

7575744493
7309055303
7366528118
in vars q105, q106, q107 respectively), but then there is also a mobile number in q115 (mobile = 7823598150).  So, did this person nominate three people?  Or four?

 

If interpretation (B ) is correct, then subjects could nominate up to 10 others, not five as I had been thinking.  Please help clarify.  Also also, there are two codebooks (attached) – which should I be using? 
Thanks, I am looking forward to making headway on this.

Subject: EU data on domestic workers 2018

Hi Scott,

I have been trying to pin this down in advance of our meeting, and have found the following (useful?) source: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1427&langId=en

In EU parlance, domestic workers are part of the Personal and  Household Service sector (PHS) made up of 'social work within accommodation' (NACE 88) and 'activities of households as employers of domestic personnel' (NACE 97/ SIC 97)

In an 2018 thematic review, the EU estimated the number of NACE 88 workers in the UK at 929,000 and NACE 97 workers at 51,000 (Q3, 2017). (Figure I, p.13 in the attached file).

Would this give us reasonable grounds for an estimate of circa 1 million?

Best wishes 
Caroline

Dear Caroline and Dr Moser,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Please see attached the updated coding, I have corrected the weighting for all categories (including dichotomous) and created a "composite_risk" variable that measures each respondent's risk index.

 

Thank you, and please let me know whether this looks right now. I am happy to make any changes if necessary.

 

Have a great weekend.

Thank you!  This is massively helpful!

 

I’m happy to report some SUCCESS!  I figured out the personal network size issue in the data (persons 8 and 60 were messing me up! Ha!)  I’m currently running a big batch of RDS estimation.  So far, nothing surprising – prevalence is consistently between 30 and 40 percent.  Then I’ll turn to the NSUM + RDS design estimation with neighbourhood bootstrap.

 

Then I think we should return to the paper: writing and thinking about venues for publication.

Selim: did the Zotero references I sent work out for you?  Were you able to use them in Caroline’s draft paper?  

 

Yea!

Scott

Dear Dr Moser, 

 

Thank you for your email, and please do not worry, as I am happy to be helpful to you at any point. 

 

Regarding your question, we informed the NGOs to select seeds as the individuals with the most 'social connections' in the community with the hope that they could trigger more referrals. They are highly likely to be active members of the NGOs. 

 

Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions. 

 

With kind regards,

Dear Selim,

Thank you, this is excellent.

 

‘Last question’ (ha! Famous last words!) How were the seeds selected?   I think it was determined by the Advocacy Groups (?). But any and all information on how the initial seeds were contacted/ determined would help me a lot.

 

More soon,

Dear Dr Moser, 

 

Thank you for your email. 

 

The sum of the risks is the 'composite_risk' variable, adding up categories 1 to 11. 

 

Categories 12 and 13 are the two dichotomous indicators, they are weighted with either 0 or 1. Category 12 is 'high degree of exploitation', and category 13 is 'lower degree of exploitation'. In short, categories 12 and 13 are not part of the composite risk (see the screenshot below for more details), so they do not need to add up to 1. 

 

Thank you. I hope this helps, and please let me know if anything is unclear. 

 

With kind regards, 

 

Selim Yilmaz

Subject: Re: Selim Risk Index Update 

 

So sorry if I’m being dense, but I really do not understand the latest data from Selim, namely the file Update Selim Risk Index.csv.    First, there is no variable called ‘sum_categories’ as there is in the previous data file, `Further Coding Update.xlsx`.  That is fine, as I can easily add up the values for `Category_1`.. to 13.  **However**, the new values for these variables -- 

category_1category_2category_3category_4category_5category_6category_7category_8category_9category_10category_11category_12category_13

Do not make sense to me.  For example, the values for Category 12 and 13 are all either 0 or 1.  But this will make the sum greater than one in many cases.  But the whole idea was to have a separate, continuous indicator of explotation.  Should I exclude both of these categories?

 

Sorry and thanks,

Scott

Subject: GNSUM Population estimates 
 

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have now looked up the statistics related to the population estimates that we have discussed.

Referrals to the NRM
Perhaps the most robust are the UKs NRM figures. These start in April 2009, with the latest estimate available for the first quarter of 2023. Totally up these estimates gives a total of 73,019 referrals.

Calculated from the following subtotals: 
All referrals Jan to March 2023: 4,746
All referrals Jan to Dec 2022: 16,938
Positive reasonable grounds decisions at time of referral to the NRM (1st April 2009 - Dec 2021)(All adults, all minors and age unknown)* : 51,335

*This represents a slightly lower figure than all referrals (e.g. for the annual figures that are available for 2021 - 'all referrals' stand at 12,706 while 'positive grounds referrals for all adults, all minors and age unknown is reported at 11,371). 


The annual NRM figures reported between 2009-2021 are contained in the attached file, which I have downloaded from https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/14939numberofpotentialmodernslaveryvictimswithinthenationalreferralmechanismbyageandgenderukyearendingdecember2009toyearendingdecember2021

The figure for the year 2022 was 16,938, obtained from from  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2022/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2022

Further statistics are available for the first quarter of 2023 (Jan to Mar) with a further 4,746 referrals https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-january-to-march-2023/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-quarter-1-2023-january-to-march


Number of domestic workers in the UK
Previous NGO reports have used the Overseas Domestic Workers' Visa figure to estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK (see for example, recent blog by Trust for London https://trustforlondon.org.uk/news/domestic-workers-day-2022/#:~:text=Worldwide%20there%20are%2067%20million,wages%2C%20physical%20and%20sexual%20abuse., and earlier Kalayaan report http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/documents/Kalayaan%20Oxfam%20report.pdf).  Selim has found the most recent published statistics for this, which state that 19,780 overseas domestic worker visas were issued in the year to June 2023
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2023/why-do-people-come-to-the-uk-to-work

As I mentioned, this direct comparison is complicated by the fact that some of our respondents may have now have settled status, or may be in domestic work on an EEA visa (e.g. those from South America) and so is likely an underestimation of the true population ( and not even considering those in domestic work without the legal right to work)

We could perhaps clarify our sample and identify the sub set of those on 'tied' visas (we did ask this question) and then use this sub-sample for bootstrapping and comparison purposes. Selim - can you tell us how many respondents reported that they were on a tied visa?  or, alternatively/ in addition perhaps conduct some sort of sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of various levels of under-estimation.

I hope this helps, 

Best wishes
Caroline

Amazing!  Thanks!   I am *finally* getting to implementing the F&S NSUM stuff.  Hot dog!  I have forgotten *so much*! Ha!

From what I remember, we have one pivot group, namely those that have been refered to the NRM.  Is this correct?  If so, do we know how large this ‘know group size’ is?  I have 73K or 74K in my head for some reason.

 

Yea!

Scott

Subject: EU data on domestic workers 2018

 

Hi Scott,

 

I have been trying to pin this down in advance of our meeting, and have found the following (useful?) source: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1427&langId=en

 

In EU parlance, domestic workers are part of the Personal and  Household Service sector (PHS) made up of 'social work within accommodation' (NACE 88) and 'activities of households as employers of domestic personnel' (NACE 97/ SIC 97)

 

In an 2018 thematic review, the EU estimated the number of NACE 88 workers in the UK at 929,000 and NACE 97 workers at 51,000 (Q3, 2017). (Figure I, p.13 in the attached file).

 

Would this give us reasonable grounds for an estimate of circa 1 million?

 

Best wishes 

Caroline

Dear  Both, 

I did a bit of a deep dive (again!) into the F&S 2016 (?) paper and looked at the data and codebook again.  I’m sorry I didn’t do so before our meeting today b/c/ it would have been much better to discuss the following instead of an email.   Sorry for the bother, but could we meet on Teams very briefly early next week to have a short chat?    Here are some of the issues:

The questions for ‘how many people in H (=the hidden population)’ – e.g.  Q33. 5a5 , Q33. 5a7, Q49. 5c6 

Q64. 5d11 

Q83. 5f16 

Q88. 5f16 

Q89. 5f15 

  -- don’t exactly match up with q36 and q80 that we use in the RDS estimation.

 

Worse, the ‘known population’ method we discussed (using “Q89. 5f15: Do you know personally of any other domes�c workers who went through the NRM system? If so, how many? Numerical value “) has TONS of missing values in the data-set, which makes it unusable for us.  We could try the number of DW in the UK, but we only have a vague idea of the size of this population.  

 

Basically, we need a way of estimating the average number of DWs people in the sample know.  Weirdly, I think I need to _exclude_ those that we think are in H (the exact opposite as the RDS technique).  

 

Oh, and I continue to have questions about the codebook and how variables are named in the data set.  For example, the codebook only goes up to Q90, but the excel data contains over 100 question varables.

 

Sorry and thanks,

Scott

Hi Scott,

We could justify the selection of themes 2 and 3 with reference to the Bellagio-Harvard guidelines (https://glc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/the_bellagio-_harvard_guidelines_on_the_legal_parameters_of_slavery.pdf)

These guidelines define forced labour as 'all work or service which is exacted from any person with menace of any penalty (theme 3) and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily (theme 2)'

This would create a 'high bar' definition of forced labour. We could perhaps still justify the use of the total NRM figures (which include other forms of modern slavery in addition to forced labour) on conservative grounds. Some NRM statistics do attempt to split out 'labour exploitation', but I cannot find a cumulative analysis and even in recent figures there is an unhelpful 'labour and criminal exploitation' category.

Is this a narrow path forward?

Best wishes
Caroline

PS. I ran things through an LLM and got the following, when asking for themes or topics asked in both ‘types’ of questions.  Themes 2 and 3 look promising, but the question wording seems different/ more specific for questions about individual experiences (?)  I don’ tknow if this is true, but if so perhas we could aggregate/ combine some of the questions about individuals to make them comparison to the questions about ‘how many X do you know?”?

 

 

>>>

To identify personal experiences asked about in both types of questions, we need to look for overlapping themes or specific experiences in the respondent's working conditions (first type) that are also inquired about in terms of the respondent's knowledge of other domestic workers' situations (second type). Essentially, we're looking for topics covered in both sets of questions that pertain to both the respondents themselves and their awareness of these issues among their peers.

 

Considering the lists provided:

 

**Shared Themes in Both Types of Questions:**

 

1. **Working Conditions and Satisfaction**: 

   - First type: Questions like Q19 (job enjoyment) and Q23 (satisfaction with working conditions).

   - Second type: Q14 (knowing others dissatisfied with their working conditions) and Q35 (knowing others suffering from bad working conditions).

   

2. **Freedom and Restrictions**:

   - First type: Q29 (being forced to work), Q30 (control over work times), and Q32 (feeling unable to leave work premises).

   - Second type: Q33 (knowing others experiencing restrictions on their freedom).

 

3. **Abuse and Mistreatment**:

   - First type: Q44 (experiencing abuse, harassment, or physical violence), Q45 (forced, deceived, or threatened into poor working conditions), Q47 (employer intimidation or threats), and Q48 (verbal abuse from employer).

   - Second type: Q49 (knowing others who have experienced the use of threat or force).

 

4. **Health and Safety**:

   - First type: Q72 (feeling that the working environment is safe and healthy) and Q73 (access to medical care).

   - Second type: Q68 (knowing others suffering from mental ill health), Q74 (knowing others who do not have access to medical care), and Q77 (knowing others suffering from bad environmental conditions).

 

5. **Document Access and Legal Rights**:

   - First type: Q70 (employer or agent withholding travel and identity documentation).

   - Second type: Q71 (knowing others who do not have access to their own travel and identity documents).

 

These themes represent areas where the survey seeks to understand not only the personal experiences of the respondents concerning their working conditions, freedom, abuse, health, and legal rights but also their awareness of similar issues faced by other domestic workers they know.

Thank you again for the interesting meeting today!

 

Here are the ‘how many people do you know?’ questions and I found (not guaranteed to be complete):

 
Q13: 2f_howmany_population: Asks if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers in the UK and requests a numerical value of how many, based on contacts in their mobile phone.
Q14: 2g_howmany_dissatisfied: Inquires whether the respondent knows any domestic workers who are dissatisfied with their current working conditions, also asking for a numerical value.
Q21: 4c: Questions if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who do not have good relations with their employers, asking for a numerical value.
Q25: 4g: Asks if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who do not enjoy their work, with a response in numerical value.
Q33: 5a5: Inquires whether the respondent knows other domestic workers experiencing restrictions on their freedom, requesting a numerical value.
Q35: 5a7: Asks if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers suffering from bad working conditions, with a response in numerical value.
Q43: 5b8: Asks if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who have experienced problems with debt or pay, requesting a numerical value.
Q49: 5c6: Inquires if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who have experienced the use of threat or force, with a response in numerical value.
Q68: 5e4: Questions whether the respondent personally knows other domestic workers suffering from mental ill health, requesting a numerical value.
Q71: 5f3: Asks if the respondent knows other domestic workers who do not have access to their own travel and identity documents, with a response in numerical value.
Q74: 5f6: Inquires if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who do not have access to medical care, with a response in numerical value.
Q77: 5f9: Questions whether the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who suffer from bad environmental conditions, with a response in numerical value.
Q79: 5f11: Asks if the respondent knows other domestic workers who do not know where to go for help, with a response in numerical value.
Q83: 5f16: Inquires if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who have suffered from severe forms of labor exploitation without using the NRM, with a response in numerical value.
Q84: 5f15: Questions if the respondent personally knows other domestic workers who went through the NRM system, with a numerical value response.

.. on the publication front, promisingly BJM have a 'methodological corner' - a call for methodologically inspired articles that offer to advance management research. A search of 'RDS' within the journal produces 0 hits at present - so we do seem to be onto something new to the field.

In the light of this, I have started drafting a 'wrapper' that positions the paper to top and tail the earlier RDS draft I circulated. I have included Zotero citations in this and begun my own reference library (hopefully this is easy to merge). I have asked Selim for a copy of the earlier draft he has worked up with the Zotero links (unless you have a copy of this already that you can share?)
Once I have grafted these drafts together I shall share in full, but below is an outline of the current abstract in which I've tried to capture the direction of the paper:


"Investigation of criminal managerial activities represent distinctive methodological sampling problems for researchers wishing to access so called ‘hidden’ or hard-to-reach populations. Such empirical management research needs to be conducted in circumstances where a representative population sample is hard to obtain. Recent advances in statistical techniques such as the use of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and network scale up (NSUM) modelling methods enable use of the underlying structure of respondents’ social networks to reduce the sampling biases that may occur in practice within convenience samples and therefore enable more robust population estimates. This paper presents and discusses the application of and opportunities for the use of RDS and NSUM in the management field drawing upon illustrations from an exploratory empirical study which used these techniques to estimate the nature and scale of labour exploitation among domestic workers in the United Kingdom. Both practical and theoretical opportunities, and limitations of these approaches, are discussed and their potential use in future management research outlined."

Hi Scott,

Yes indeed - A Happy Easter to you too.

The NRM figure I gave you is a cummulative total 'since records began, rather than the annual figure. Does this explain the discrepancy?

Hi Scott,

Hope that you had/ are having a good Easter break. I've looked back at the NRM figures again  - and to me my snap Good Friday still email does seem to me to explain the difference-  are you happy with us using the cumulative figure rather than one annual total of positive grounds decisions?

I have some time this week (before I'm on leave again until the beginning of the summer semester) to amalgamate the two article drafts I've written into one cohesive wrapper for your statistical analysis targeted at the British Journal of Management. 

To pick up the thread from where our previous discussion left off, I know that our methodology may not be novel in statistical terms, but since I could not find any mention of RDS or NSUM within a journal article search of BJM I do think that is it claimable as new to the Management literature so shall work on positioning our contribution in this way. Does this sound OK to you?

Caroline

.. on further reflection your question has prompted me to review the total which, at the moment includes both adult and child referrals. Given that all the DWs we surveyed where over 23 I think that we should perhaps use a recalculated total of only adults. I'll do that tomorrow and email you the result for when you're back.

Hi Scott,

Here is my revised best estimation of the positive grounds referrals for ADULTS ONLY between April 2009 when records began and the first quarter of 2023 (Jan- Mar) when we started our survey.

April 2009 - Dec 2021 (see 'NRM positive grounds referrals' spreadsheet attached) 32,917
Jan 2022- Dec 2022 8,854  (this figure- and the 2023 figure below are ALL referrals - I can't see a breakdown for positive grounds - which is more conservative)
Jan 2023-Mar 2023 2,589

Total= 44,360

Removing the number of children does make quite a difference. I hope that this doesn't mess things up.

Best wishes
Caroline

Subject: GNSUM Population estimates
 

Hi Scott and Selim,

I have now looked up the statistics related to the population estimates that we have discussed.

Referrals to the NRM
Perhaps the most robust are the UKs NRM figures. These start in April 2009, with the latest estimate available for the first quarter of 2023. Totally up these estimates gives a total of 73,019 referrals.

Calculated from the following subtotals: 
All referrals Jan to March 2023: 4,746
All referrals Jan to Dec 2022: 16,938
Positive reasonable grounds decisions at time of referral to the NRM (1st April 2009 - Dec 2021)(All adults, all minors and age unknown)* : 51,335

*This represents a slightly lower figure than all referrals (e.g. for the annual figures that are available for 2021 - 'all referrals' stand at 12,706 while 'positive grounds referrals for all adults, all minors and age unknown is reported at 11,371). 


The annual NRM figures reported between 2009-2021 are contained in the attached file, which I have downloaded from https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/14939numberofpotentialmodernslaveryvictimswithinthenationalreferralmechanismbyageandgenderukyearendingdecember2009toyearendingdecember2021

The figure for the year 2022 was 16,938, obtained from from  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2022/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2022

Further statistics are available for the first quarter of 2023 (Jan to Mar) with a further 4,746 referrals https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-january-to-march-2023/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-quarter-1-2023-january-to-march


Number of domestic workers in the UK
Previous NGO reports have used the Overseas Domestic Workers' Visa figure to estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK (see for example, recent blog by Trust for London https://trustforlondon.org.uk/news/domestic-workers-day-2022/#:~:text=Worldwide%20there%20are%2067%20million,wages%2C%20physical%20and%20sexual%20abuse., and earlier Kalayaan report http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/documents/Kalayaan%20Oxfam%20report.pdf).  Selim has found the most recent published statistics for this, which state that 19,780 overseas domestic worker visas were issued in the year to June 2023
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2023/why-do-people-come-to-the-uk-to-work

As I mentioned, this direct comparison is complicated by the fact that some of our respondents may have now have settled status, or may be in domestic work on an EEA visa (e.g. those from South America) and so is likely an underestimation of the true population ( and not even considering those in domestic work without the legal right to work)

We could perhaps clarify our sample and identify the sub set of those on 'tied' visas (we did ask this question) and then use this sub-sample for bootstrapping and comparison purposes. Selim - can you tell us how many respondents reported that they were on a tied visa?  or, alternatively/ in addition perhaps conduct some sort of sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of various levels of under-estimation.

I hope this helps, 

Best wishes
Caroline

Subject: Updated BJM draft and author guidelines for BJM 'Methodology corner'

Hi Scott and Selim,

The author guidelines state:

Our finished article should be no more than 6,000 words, excluding  abstract, references, figures and tables. 

I've attached my latest draft, an updated version of the Zotero file and a link  (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1467-8551.12064?saml_referrer)  to a published 'methodology corner ' article that gives a feel for what they're after. 

I feel that the attached content will need further reshaping to fit the bill, but am sharing these details to check that you're happy with  where I'm heading

I'm now away for a week before the start of term, but will pick this up again on my return, and incorporate any feedback that you have time to give in the meanwhile.

Selim, I've copied you for information - I know that when we last communicated you did not want to be listed as an author but let me know if this changes.

Best wishes 
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

Thank you for your email!  I am sorry for not replying sooner.  Easter break was quite nice, and I’m very happy that lecturing has just wrapped up for me!  I am getting back to research (before the flood of marking starts!) and this is number two on my ‘list.’  I’m afraid I need to spend some time to get back into it, as I’ve forgotten where I/we were at.  I remember when I last worked on this there was a non-trivial technical issue I was having with some of the bootstrapping. I have an idea of how to resolve this problem, but haven’t implemented it yet.

Last I remember we were waiting on me (scott) to perform both the RDS estimation and also the NSUM estimation.  Oh!  I just remembered there was an issue with the questions – as in how to ‘properly’ compare the RDS estimates to the NSUM estimates, as the former is ‘egocentric’ and the latter is not.

I agree that we should push on this and get it ‘out the door’ as soon as we can.

Best,

Scott

I hope that the R&R is now put to bed and that you have been able to make some headway with the intransigent RDS/NSUM issue.

As I said, I am taking some annual leave - returning 18 July. If I don't hear from you in the meantime, I'll drop you a line when I return.

Really looking forward to seeing all the work that you've done on this come together. I so appreciate your support and expertise with this.

Hi Scott,

I am encouraged to be moving up the rankings! I submit an outline bid to Nuffield but did not get any further. The feedback that I received is shown below - as you can see it was not very detailed.

The advice I received from Nick Wright and Zoe was that the overall bid should really be in the £350- £400 K ballpark for it to be considered for funding. To achieve this, we shortened the timeframe for the project, and costed RAs for only a proportion of the overall project time. Tori Hayward, the Business School's Research Development Manager presented to an OMIS teams meeting recently and I have included her slides. One of the useful things she discussed was a social science SharePoint site containing successful applications for each scheme - the navigation is on slide 9 - perhaps you can get access to this?

Dear Dr. Emberson,

Re: Co-producing Behavioural Improvements In The Provision Of Unformalised Domestic Care

Thank you for your outline application for a Nuffield Foundation grant, which we have now had a chance to consider.
 
I am sorry to tell you that your proposal has not been shortlisted for proceeding to a full grant application. We received a large and strong array of outlines, and given very competitive grant rounds we are only able to shortlist a small proportion of the requests we receive. 
 
Due to the large volume of applications we receive in each round, we do not provide detailed feedback on most outlines. However, we can say that although your proposal tackles an interesting topic of relevance to our interests, in comparison to the many other outlines we received it scored less highly on the other criteria we use to assess applications. The assessment criteria we use can be found in our Guide for Applicants. A proposal may score well against some of the criteria but still not be shortlisted if it does not score sufficiently well against others. 
 
Thank you again for taking the time to submit your outline to us for consideration. I am sorry to send a disappointing reply, and wish you luck in your search for funds. 
 
Yours sincerely,

Dr Catherine Dennison
Programme Head, Welfare

Dear Scott,

I hope that your travel plans have gone well. And thank you for taking the time to email me. My recollection of the project is rather dim and I would need to reread the emails that we exchanged before I could usefully reply to your questions. I shall re-read the thread and come back to you as soon as I can. 

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I am so very sorry for not being in touch sooner!  This project has indeed moved to the top of my ‘to do’ list.  But I am furiously packing and leaving on a flight at 8am tomorrow.  I had hoped to send you a thorough email of where (I think) we are, and what is next.  Alas, I haven’t made it.  Here is what I have at the moment…. Sorry.

 

 

!  I hope you are enjoying your summer.  Mine is coming to an end far too quickly.  I have several things on my mind, so apologies for the long email (if a Teams meeting would be better, I’m happy to do so).

 

1.There were two technical issues I was having with the analysis of your data: one about RDS bootstraps and one about NSUM.  I’ve looked into he former, emailed the author, interrogated their code (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Neighboot/index.html), and have to give up.  BUT! I have a second approach in mind, which I just started.  So, I’m keeping the faith 😊  The second I haven’t worked on much, but will do so.

1a.I don’t know where we left things,  BUT: I have extensive notes and emails.  So I’m hoping once the analysis is done (my bad) we should be close.  Last I remember there was an issue comparing RDS questions to NSUM questions on the survey (?)

1b.I *think* the third issue holding us up was something about comparing NSUM estimates to RDS estimates and the question of which survey questions to use.  Does that ring any bells?  I have a vague memory of some questionsion about self/others matching up, but others not.  But that in the later case we could aggregate some questions to obtain comparability(??)

 

2.I want to pick your brain about your domestic worker  (DW) data if you can.  What survey form did you use?  If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently?
3. I ask for a number of reasons but primarily b/c I’m working on  a grant bid to Nuffield.  I still have a lot of work (I haven’t even picked a ‘population’ e.g. DWs, construction workers, agricultural workers).  Are you interested in being part of the grant?  I think your experience would help the project considerably.

 

I’ll be on the (far) west coast of the US for about a week.  Feel free to email, but I don’t know how timely my replies will be until I return to Nottingham.

 

I am still optimistic I can make sufficient progress on this in August.

 

By the way: thank you for being a wonderful co-author!  Not all of mine are at the moment, so thank you for your kind patience.

 

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I hope that the R&R is now put to bed and that you have been able to make some headway with the intransigent RDS/NSUM issue.

 

As I said, I am taking some annual leave - returning 18 July. If I don't hear from you in the meantime, I'll drop you a line when I return.

 

Really looking forward to seeing all the work that you've done on this come together. I so appreciate your support and expertise with this.

 

Best wishes for a good summer,

 

Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I hope you are enjoying your summer!  I have *not* forgotten about our paper, and have ‘poked at it’ a little in the past few weeks.  I have an R&R deadline I need to address first, and I’m out of town most of next week.  If you don’t hear back from me by Friday next, may I please invite you to ‘ping’ me?  Oddly, I still have not resolved the ‘minor technical’ issue I was having ages ago.

 

I am excited to finish this off, see the results and get is polished!  Thank you again for working with me 😊

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

In response to the specific points that you raise, please see my initial thoughts in yellow below:

1.There were two technical issues I was having with the analysis of your data: one about RDS bootstraps and one about NSUM.  I’ve looked into he former, emailed the author, interrogated their code (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Neighboot/index.html), and have to give up.  BUT! I have a second approach in mind, which I just started.  So, I’m keeping the faith 😊  The second I haven’t worked on much, but will do so. 

That is such a pity - the bootstrapping seemed really helpful. I admire you persistence and wish you every success with the second approach. Thank you very much for persevering.
1a.I don’t know where we left things,  BUT: I have extensive notes and emails.  So I’m hoping once the analysis is done (my bad) we should be close.  
I have tried to capture the essence of our methodological conversations in the paper draft for BJM's methodological corner. Whether on not this is the right outlet, I don't know, but hopefully we can build on my interpretation of what you have explained methodologically and get a good paper out of it. Please let me know if you would like me to resend the draft as it currently stands.
Last I remember there was an issue comparing RDS questions to NSUM questions on the survey (?)
I'm not sure that I have captured this issue anywhere. If you have time to record a video stream I could try to write it up for us and add it to the paper?
1b.I *think* the third issue holding us up was something about comparing NSUM estimates to RDS estimates and the question of which survey questions to use. 

Again, I am not sure that currently I have captured this issue. If this works for you, perhaps you could record your thoughts? I thought that this worked very well last time you did it. 
 Does that ring any bells?  I have a vague memory of some questionsion about self/others matching up, but others not.  
Yes - I do remember you speaking about this. It was to do with some respondents saying that they knew no one who was in a certain situation type and then also listing contact numbers at the end. We decided, I think, to increase the null value to show that instead that they were in contact with at least the number of people whose contact numbers they had indicated. Perhaps this is what you mean by the statement below?
But that in the later case we could aggregate some questions to obtain comparability(??)
 
2.I want to pick your brain about your domestic worker  (DW) data if you can.  What survey form did you use? I can't remember now. It used to be called the Bristol On Line Survey - but I believe that it has changed its name  If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently? I would do what you've done and read the papers more thoroughly to start with! In particular ask supplementary questions of those identified as part of the hidden population - we had these contacts, but didn't approach them directly and therefore missed out on some valuable data that would have helped with the NSUM calculation.
3. I ask for a number of reasons but primarily b/c I’m working on  a grant bid to Nuffield.  I still have a lot of work (I haven’t even picked a ‘population’ e.g. DWs, construction workers, agricultural workers).  Are you interested in being part of the grant?  That is very kind of you Scott - if you think that my experience could be of help, then I would be happy to be part of the grant. I work mostly on modern slavery among domestic  care workers so - if it is indeed part of the population that you end up considering, I would be happy to be involved. I think your experience would help the project considerably.
 
I’ll be on the (far) west coast of the US for about a week.  Feel free to email, but I don’t know how timely my replies will be until I return to Nottingham. Have a great time! And speak to you when you return

Best wishes
