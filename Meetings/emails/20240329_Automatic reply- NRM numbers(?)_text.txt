Thank you for your email. I am away from my email until 4th April and will respond on my return.

 

The university will be closed from Friday 29 March to Tuesday 2 April (inclusive). The summer term will start on Monday 29th April. The University website provides more information about services available on campus over the Easter Break, and their opening hours. 

 

However, if you are a student needing assistance in this time, the following support is available:

 

Library Support

These library web pages contain everything you need to know about accessing library resources and services before, and during, the break.

 

Mental Health and Wellbeing

There are many mental health & wellbeing resources here to help you pro-actively take care of your mental health and wellbeing during the break and support and wellbeing appointments can be booked online.



Best wishes

Caroline
