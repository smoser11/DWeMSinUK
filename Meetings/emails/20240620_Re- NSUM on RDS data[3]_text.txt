Hi Scott,

Thank you so much for the update. I too would like to get this out for review (fingers crossed). I hope that you can finalise your R&R. I shall happily drop you a line toward the end of next week - though to warn you in advance I am taking some annual leave between 1st -17th July. 

Look forward to hearing about your progress and I hope that you manage to bottom the minor technical issue.

It is a pleasure to work with you!

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

 

I hope you are enjoying your summer!  I have *not* forgotten about our paper, and have â€˜poked at itâ€™ a little in the past few weeks.  I have an R&R deadline I need to address first, and Iâ€™m out of town most of next week.  If you donâ€™t hear back from me by Friday next, may I please invite you to â€˜pingâ€™ me?  Oddly, I still have not resolved the â€˜minor technicalâ€™ issue I was having ages ago.

 

I am excited to finish this off, see the results and get is polished!  Thank you again for working with me ðŸ˜Š

Best,

Scott
