Hi Scott,

Yes indeed - A Happy Easter to you too.

The NRM figure I gave you is a cummulative total 'since records began, rather than the annual figure. Does this explain the discrepancy?

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

We made it!  To Easter break!  Huzzah!  I still have marking, but at least teaching is winding down.

I was tidying my browser and found this

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2020/modern-slavery-national-referral-mechanism-and-duty-to-notify-statistics-uk-end-of-year-summary-2020

 

which has NRM refereals for 202 at about 10K, not the 70+k Iâ€™ve been using.  Can you help me square this?

Happy Easater!

Scott
