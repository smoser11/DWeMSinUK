Dear Caroline and Dr Moser,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Please see attached the updated coding, I have corrected the weighting for all categories (including dichotomous) and created a "composite_risk" variable that measures each respondent's risk index.

 

Thank you, and please let me know whether this looks right now. I am happy to make any changes if necessary.

 

Have a great weekend.

 

With kind regards,

 

Selim Yilmaz
