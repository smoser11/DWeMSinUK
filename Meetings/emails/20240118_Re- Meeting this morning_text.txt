Thanks for your understanding Scott. I have planned in some time to go through your videos next week so, if this timing works for you, are you free to meet  from 3.30 onwards on Thursday 25th? Hope we can fix a date/time.

Best wishes

Dear Caroline,
Thanks for this and I completely understand re: teaching prep.  As we noted in the Autumn, you and I are having 'opposite' semesters in terms of teaching work load üôÅ
Yes lets please meet in late Jan (25?26?  whatever is best for you both) to touch base and give me more 'homework'.
Stay warm,
scott

Thank you Scott - I'll watch these as soon as I can - though I must warn you both that I am preparing for teaching  what is for me a new moduled at the moment and my diary is getting a bit tight. It is good that you have captured your thinking while it is still fresh. 

Best wishes
Caroline

Dear Caroline,

I am most sorry to have missed our Monday meeting.  I was jetlagged, preparing for further travel, and simply 'wimped out.'  Here is a (two part... doh!) video in my attempt to 'catch up' on our research.

Part 1 (15 mins): Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUp1.webm
Part 2 (15 mins):Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUp2.webm

It gets a bit rambling at times so here is an outline based on the transcript in the hopes it is of some help.  I think our next step is to settle on the next steps (HA!)

### Organized Outline of the Transcript

#### 1. Introduction
   - **Context:** Scott's apology for missing the Monday meeting.
   - **Purpose:** Sending a recording to update Carolyn on the progress due to poor typing and spelling skills.

#### 2. Conceptualization and Measurement
   - **Population Definition:** Domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones during survey fielding.
   - **Target Population:** Domestic workers in the UK who have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months.
   - **Operationalization of 'Hidden Population':**
     - Dichotomous measures: Payment below legal minimum wage and referral to the national referral mechanism.
     - Continuous measure: Risk of experiencing modern slavery based on various indicators.

#### 3. Sampling Methodology
   - **Data Source:** RDS (Respondent-Driven Sampling) sample of domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones.
   - **Subgroups within Sample:** Clusters based on nationality (Philippines, Latinx, British born).

#### 4. Data Issues and Estimation
   - **Population Estimates:** Using survey data to estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK.
   - **RDS Data Utilization:** Using techniques from Gile et al. for successive sampling population size estimates.
   - **Robustness of Analysis:** Exploring robustness to different priors and sample sizes.

#### 5. Analysis Strategy
   - **RDS Estimation:** Discussion on the off-the-shelf RDS method and SSPS (Successive Sampling Population Size Estimates).
   - **Disaggregating by Origin:** Potential for separate analysis of different nationality clusters.
   - **Estimation Challenges:** Issues with zeros in the data and social network information.

#### 6. Integration of RDS and NSUM Methods
   - **Combining Techniques:** Exploring the possibility of integrating RDS weights with NSUM (Non-Sampling Error and Unit-level Measurement Error) methods for more powerful analysis.

#### 7. Presentation and Discussion
   - **Data Presentation:** Deciding on the format (tables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian posterior series).
   - **Further Discussion Points:** Need for more discussion to guide presentation choices.

#### 8. Conclusion
   - **Recap:** Summary of the discussed points and apology for any confusion caused by the message format.

Do you want to reschedule a meeting for either the 25th or 26th Jan? That way Selim can join us too?
