Thanks for the prompt, Scott.
RE: Domestic Worker population in the UK
I've had a quick scan through the references that google thinks that I may find interesting on this and have come up with what could be a useful starting point from WIEGO https://www.wiego.org/sites/default/files/publications/file/WIEGO_Statistical_Brief_N32_DWs%20in%20the%20World.pdf

This brief summarises country statistics from the ILOSTAT database, giving a headline figure for Europe of 2.5 million.

Is this a database that you're familiar with, or would you like me to see if I can dig out a UK or even an England figure?

Best wishes
Caroline

Howdy all. 

 

I wanted to follow up on out DWinUK paper.  I feel like we are close, but I also feel like I do not want to loose the ‘momentum’ we have.  On my end, I think I only need the answers to my previous email to finish off the RDS analysis.  I do still need to work on the NSUM analysis (more on this below).

 

  Selim: are you able to help with answers regarding the data set?  Specifically about Q105 to Q110/ Q115?  And the two versions of the Codebook?  I really need to comprehend the ‘referrals’ (=’coupons’) parameters and data.

 

Selim: at our last meeting we talked about you working on implementing the ‘neighbour bootstrap.’  I attach the paper and the CRAN links -- < https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Neighboot/index.html > to help you get started.  I will work on the NSUM part. 


Caroline: As you know, we need a ‘prior belief’ about the size of the population from which we are sampling, e.g. the number of Domestic Workers in the UK.  I had mentioned that I noodled around and came up with a very rough estimate that of 1.74 million DW in the UK.   I confess I cannot find the exact source of that guestimate. Indeed, it seems that perhaps that was an overestimate:

(see also the attached).

 

I do hope we can move forward on this paper soon.  Please do let me know if I can help facilitate.

Best,

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

Thanks for your perseverance with cleaning the data. I'm happy with DWinUK either with or without the +EE. I hope that Selim may be in a position to deal with your codebook and detailed coding queries?

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Subject: DWinUK data 

 

Dear both,

Thank you for a wonderful – and mind-expanding – meeting on Friday!  I hope you have enjoyed your respective weekends. 

 

Some scattered thoughts: (1) is there an acronym I should be using in meials to refer to this paper?  I'm thinking 'DWinUK' (= domestic workers in the UK) or perhaps with a 'experiencing exploitation' (+EE?)

 

(2) What I thought would be an two-hour side project has turned into a bit of a small creature, regarding the data we are using. 

I am trying to 'clean' the data, specifically adjust the 'personal network size' (q13) in light of the number of referrals a person made, as we discussed on Friday.   Turns out I have loads more questions about the data (sorry, Selim!).  To wit, please consider the attached file, `DWinUK_data.csv`, which is exactly the  file `Further Coding Update.xlsx` just with 'clean'variable names.  I am confused about the way the questions are recorded as variables.  For example, I originally thought that​ (A) the variables q105​ to q110​ contained the (up-to) five referrals (the 'coupons' in RDS language).  However, upon closer inspection, it seems that (B ) perhaps the variables q105​ to q115​ might contain the mobile numbers of referals (see ID 13, row 11 in the CSV file).  HOWEVER, however, (C)  ID 14 (row 12) seems to thwart this interpretation, because this person seems to have nominated three other DWs (

7575744493
7309055303
7366528118
in vars q105, q106, q107 respectively), but then there is also a mobile number in q115 (mobile = 7823598150).  So, did this person nominate three people?  Or four?

 

If interpretation (B ) is correct, then subjects could nominate up to 10 others, not five as I had been thinking.  Please help clarify.  Also also, there are two codebooks (attached) – which should I be using? 
Thanks, I am looking forward to making headway on this.
