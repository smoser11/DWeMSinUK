Hi Scott and Selim,

I am free to meet on Monday 21st  before 1.30 or after 4pm . Scott, would you like to suggest a convenient time and whether you would prefer to meet in person or remotely that day?

As I understand it, the probe alters are the total of other DWs known to the sample respondents (i.e. in our survey, the number of DW contacts on their mobile phones). Thank you for these additional literature suggestions, Scott. I shall aim to have a look at these before we meet. Selim, could you please take a look at these too?

Best wishes
Caroline

Thanks for this, Selim.  The 21rst is the latest I can meet.  I’m free from the 14th-21rst only.  Sorry.  If we are to meet on the 21rst, and if this will be our last meeting b4 teaching starts (I hope not!  But lets be realistic…)  then may I please ask for how I/ we can prepare for this meeting so as to be most effective?

 

Take care and stay cool,

Scott

Dear Dr Moser, 

 

Thank you for your email. 

 

We could meet anytime on the 21st or 22nd of August at the Rights Lab. Please let me know what works best for you, day and time wise. I will be free on these days. @Caroline Emberson (staff) I assume this would work for you?

 

Thank you. 

 

With kind regards, 

 

Selim Yilmaz

Not at all!  You are very kind to think of me – thank you!

 

 

Selim: can you ping me when you get back and know your schedule?  August, but after the 18th is a very good time for me.  Lets pin something down after you get back?  I hope you are enjoying your travels!

 

Best,

Scott

Dear Caroline,

 

Oh wow!  This is wonderful.  Thank you so much for thinking of me!  Yes, I would love to talk/ collaborate/ learn more about your research!  Late August is perfect for me.

I’ll need some time to digest the materials you sent, but I look forward to doing so.

 

Best,

Scott

Dear Scott,

 

Thank you for your reply and for your evident enthusiasm for this project. I have made a start with a more detailed reading of the GNSUM literature and I have sketched out a protocol based upon Freehan and Salganik's (2014) paper of GNSUM procedures.  I am, however, not a highly trained statistician and your opinion would be of great value to us as we undertake an exploratory analysis, the protocol for which I attach here. I do hope that it may be possible for us to collaborate on this project - as you can probably now see clearly, your guidance and expertise would be invaluable to us. If you think there is value in an approach of these type, I wonder whether you might be free to meet  - either virtually or in person - with Selim and myself some time in mid- to late August after Selim returns from his holiday in China on the 18th? 

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Dear Caroline (if I may),

 

Thank you very much for your email.  I am very sorry for the inconvenience. and especially to bother you at busy times (I totally understand!)

 

I find your project very interesting and exciting!  I am vicariously happy for you all as you engage in the analysis!

 

You raise a very interesting and important issue RE: London.  Yes, I see your point.  London is SO BIG!  So if one is looking for members of any​ sub-population (doctors, domestic workers, etc. etc.) I would guess there would be more in a more highly populated area.  Then again, this is just a conjecture and could be empirically evaluated.  Just thinking aloud: for sure there are heterogeneous 'clustering' of some demographic groups by geography (above and beyond base-rates, e.g. Leicher has approximately the same percentage of non-UK born residents as London ); but I wonder if the same is true of domestic workers, victims of modern slavery, or other 'hidden groups.'  Hmm.  Possibly an interesting research project (?)  Then again, these demographic patterns almost surely match immigration patterns, I guess. 

 

Thank you again for your kind reply.  And yes!  I would love to (1) stay in touch (and hopefully convince you to collaborate! ) and (2) read your draft and learn more about the results of your study.  Really interesting!

 

I hope you and yours are enjoying the summer!

Best,

scott

Dear Professor Moser,

 

I must apologise for the delay in responding to your email, which arrived at a busy time. to address the questions that you posed:

 

Selim and I are in the process of analysing the survey responses that we received. We hope to be in a position to use GNSUM techniques on our data and to estimate a figure for the extent of labour exploitation across the domestic worker population in the UK. This is ambitious, we know, and this is very much an exploratory undertaking to see if it can be done with the type of primary data we have collected and the available secondary data related to the wider DW population. 

 

The point of contact for our survey has been primarily national DW NGOs. Specifically, we have dealt with the voice of domestic workers, and two community-based NGOs supporting respectively Filipina and Latin American workers. These tend to be based in London and so we anticipate a London bias to our sample. As Domestic workers are employed by and as individuals, in private households we have chosen to focus our initial analysis upon their employment status rather than geography.

 

I would be very interested in keeping in touch with you as the 'comparative measurement project' develops - so do please keep in touch. Selim and I will be drafting our report over the next couple of weeks, with a view to developing a methodological paper in the Autumn. I hope that we may also keep you uptodate with our progress as these develop.

 

Best wishes

 

Caroline

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Sorry for the multiple emails, but in addition to my July 5th email (below), I would be very interested to know which NGOs you are working with.  Selim mentioned the necessity of partnering so as to have access to the ‘seeds’ in an RDS design.  Just curious. 

 

Many thanks and hope you are enjoying the summer!

 

Best,

Scott

Dear Dr. Emberson and Selim,

 

Thank you again for your input an participation in the workshop Zoe kindly organized for my (nascent) 'Comparative Measurements' project idea.  I am writing to ask a few things.  First, how is your G-NSUM research project going?  I am very interested in your work, and how you are finding the research + surveys + sampling from the 'hidden population.'   i don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I'd love to both know more about this project, and also pick your brains.  Where -- as in which location -- are you sampling from (and why)?  Which NGOs are you working with?   Do you have any suggestions regarding the 'right' geographic 'level' to use (e.g. council, county/borough, region)?

Next, would you be interested in being involved with the 'Comparative Measurements' project?  I recognize I am still in the early stages, and that I need to flesh things out considerably.  But it would seem to me to be an ideal 'fit' for you both to be involved.  But no presure 🙂

 

In any event, I hope you and yours are doing well and enjoying your summer!

 

Best,

scott
