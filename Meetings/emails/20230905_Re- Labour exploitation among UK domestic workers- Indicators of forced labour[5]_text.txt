I've planned in some time on Thursday morning to read the papers that you sent through. Happy to meet with you when convenient on the 14th - just let us know.

(It said 'numerical in the attachment before - I added the 'count' for clarity in response to your message !)

Best wishes
Caroline

Doh!  So sorry – yes of course, it even says ‘Numerical – count.’  So sorry!  So, yes, in principle.  But you need to know the ‘true size’ of these groups.  So 83 5f15 looks quite promising, b/c we know the number of people gone though NRM.  The others I’m not sure of.  But you both might know of data-sources that would provide ‘known sizes.’

 

Earlier is better, but I have a deadline on the 11th that I know I’m going to miss (and am aiming for the 12th).  So, the 14th AM is likely the most feasible.  But as I said, time is of the essence, for me at least.

 

In terms of boot-strapping.  Yea, the neighboorhood bootstrat is shockingly simple, and gives great results, and is already implemented in R:.  The issue is that Selim will have to make a copy of the data and get it into the format that the ‘neighborboot’ package ‘wants’ (check out the link I sent last email).

 

Yes, also, sorry for my scattered replies.  Please do reply as you see fit.

 

Best, 

Scott

Hi Scott,

 

I'm responding to this and your other email in one thread. Thanks for the bootstrapping literature - I shall read this in more detail but the headline news is that I do think we have this data and Selim is happy to carry out the further data cleansing you suggest.

 

BTW, on the probe alters point below - they may still not be suitable probe alters, but the data are all numerical counts.

 

Very interested in the possibilities for constructing an index. Do you have a slot next week at one of the following times?

 

Tuesday 12th AM

Thursday 14th AM

Friday 15th anytime before 4pm

 

It would be great to move this forward with you  - thanks for agreeing to come on board. I understand the time constraints imposed by teaching, but hopefully we can find a way to work on this around our other commitments.

 

Best wishes

Caroline

Hi Caroline,

I’m trying to catch-up.  Please see my replies inline below.

 

More soon,

Scott

Subject: Labour exploitation among UK domestic workers: Indicators of forced labour 

 

Hi Scott,

 

I have been looking at the relation of our code book questions to the ILO indicators of forced labour that I mentioned when we spoke last week and I attach here a file that lists the questions which relate to each indicator.GNSUM ILO indicators.docx

 

[Scott Moser (staff)] Great!  And yes, Our ‘forced labor’ questions largely overlap.  I also had as possible indicators: Q36, Q21/25, Q35, Q83.  Just FYI.  But yes, we have multiple indicators.  We could either settle on one/ a few or build an index (see below).

 

 

The ILO[1] suggest that while the presence of a single indicator in a given situation may in some cases imply the existence of forced labour - a particular and severe type of labour exploitation -  while in other cases you may need to look for several indicators. The inclusion of scale-up questions for multiple indicators was designed to help us say something about the nature of the exploitation experienced by domestic workers in the UK. With the exception of the mental health question, as a next step would it perhaps be possible to identify and rank the combinations reported and then investigate the prevalence of those that are the most common or is this too complicated? 

[Scott Moser (staff)] If I am understanding you, this is potentially a very cool idea.  I think you are suggesting constructing a new variable that indicates/captures the confidence we (as researchers) have that this particular person is in MS.  If so, this might connect to the ‘risk of MS’ literature, which seems to be a big policy focus.  And which is separate from the prevalence issue.  Are you thinking about something like a Likert scale?

 

I've also separated out some more generic questions at the end of the document that we have asked and which I wondered whether might be cast in the guise of probe alters? Do tell me if I am going wildly off piste with these suggestions! 

[Scott Moser (staff)]Not to be negative, but I don’t think so.  Aren’t these questions 0/1 (as in ‘do you now someone’ yes/no?)  And for probe alters we need counts. 

 

Best wishes

Caroline
