Subject: For Today's meeting

Hi Scott,

Here are the headlines that I garnered from your exceptionally helpful videos;

Conceptually we probably need to separate out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk meaning that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

Data cleaning: we need to modify how we have dealt with the 'don't knows'. We need a separate category code for these throughout the data - perhaps labelled as 'missing'?
There are some DWs  (about 17) who, although they claim not to know any other DWs later make referrals. We need to decide how to deal with these responses. Suggested options a) remove them from the analysis b) identify an alternative statistical technique c) turn zeros into 1s -by for example, adding +1 to everyone.
You are disaggregating the sample by origin: LA, Filipino and British born
Data issues - what is the UK DW population? Population estimates vary on sites such as National careers and BICS. You are exploring how to estimate this from our RDS sample based on 'how many others do you know' (Gile 2010, 2011).
Analysis: you have currently used Giles and a new RDS technique called Successive Sampling Population Size (SSPS) estimation, including a 2023 paper which adjusts for measurement error. This is an improvement on RDS1 and RDS2 and can be used for estimation to provide a proportional measure of Q36 and Q80 in the population that can then be compared with population size. 
There may be the opportunity for a third approach - an alternative to this off the shelf RDS - which could utilise our NSUM data. This would be more powerful, since it uses more information. The problem that requires a solution is that we do not have a random sample, so need 'inclusion probability' weights. The good news is that it is straightforward to derive these weights from RDS and these can then be used within NSUM estimators
Work still to do: 
(Scott) Bootstraps; sensitivity analysis; carry out NSUM &RDS calculations; (all of us) What do we want to present and how? What tables, graphs, confidence intervals and Bayesian stats are needed? Not yet ready to produce publication graphics.

Other things I noted from what you said
current estimates suggest the proportional figure is ~30-40%. 
current estimators show good convergence
work still to be carried out includes: sensitivity analysis 
I think we should also talk about perhaps a shift in emphasis perhaps speaking to a broader scope of labour exploitation, for which the failure to be paid the NLW (Q36) and evidence of Modern Slavery (Q80)  provide 2 concrete markers on a spectrum of exploitation.

I hope this will help us structure today's meeting.

Best wishes
Caroline

Yes, I agree re: first week of teaching stresses.  I'll be on campus this Friday if you want.  Or Teams is always fine for me.
Looking forward to progression with you all!

Dear Dr Moser and Caroline,

Thank you for your email, and I apologise for the delay in my reply.

I am available anytime except Mondays and Thursdays starting next week. At the moment, I am overloaded with marking and preparing the delivery of a lecture. Please let me know when you have arranged to meet next and I will join the conversation.

In the meantime, please update me if there is anything else that I could help with.

Thank you.

With kind regards,

Selim Yilmaz

Hi Scott, 

I am half-way through listening to your videos. I note already that the clarity you provide about separating out the dichotomous and continuous variables related to exploitation and risk mean that we need to agree how to recalculate the composite variable.

I hear also that you are making good progress  working out technically how we may be able to use the RDS/convenience sample to estimate the size of the domestic worker population. I don't exactly follow this, but what you've said seems to sound promising.

I know that you suggested meeting up either Thurs 25 or Fri 26th. Selim, could you please indicate your availability so that Scott can pick a suitable time (I am available anytime except between 2-3 on Thursday or 4-5 on Friday).

I'll see if I can listen to the second video now.

Best wishes
Caroline
