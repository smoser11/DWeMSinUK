Dear Dr. Emberson, 

Thank you for your email.  Yes! I'd love to collaborate with you, provided I can contribute in a meaningful way.  In any event please do send me any drafts/papers - Id be happy to comment/ contribute if I can.  For whatever it is worth, I think your project is absolutely amazing, and needed.  Dare I say pathbreaking in the UK at least.  As in: GNSUM is potentially a very powerful method,  it without its difficulties/ limitations; we don't have a general idea of how it performs, especially in your context; so, seeing how / if it works here is really valuable.  Kudos!

Thank you also  for your very valuable input yesterday at the meeting!

Best,
Scott

Dear Scott,

It was great to meet you too - please do come back to me if it would be useful to have further details of the project that Selim is undertaking with me. Selim and I are currently drafting an article, possibly for the International Journal of Social Research Methodologies and we could perhaps send you a draft version of our paper  - which we hope to submit this Autumn  - perhaps, if both you and Selim are happy with this, with a view to co-authorship?
Best wishes
Caroline

Dear all,

 

Thank you *so much* for attending the RL meeting today!  I know people’s time is valuable and I really appreciate and got a lot out of all the brainpower of the attendees!  Thank you!

 

Please do send along any papers/ notes/ comments/ suggestions.  Please also keep me in mind for the future.  Obviously this project is in its infancy, but if there is any interest in being involved/ contributing I would of course be more than happy.  Personally, I think collaboration is key.  At least, I usually get a lot out of working and learning from colleagues.

 

Honestly, my head is spinning from all the excellent comments and suggestions.  Thank you again!

 

Best,

Scott
