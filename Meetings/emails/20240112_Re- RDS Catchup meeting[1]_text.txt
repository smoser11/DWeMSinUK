Sorry to hear about the IT failure. Yes I can do Monday at 11. I'll send through a teams link. 

Selim, I hope that you too can join us?

Best wishes - and a Happy New Year to you both

Subject: RDS Catchup meeting 
 
Dear Caroline,

Please don't hate me, but can we postpone our RDS catchup meeting scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) am, please?  I have been working on it, and have essentially 'caught myself' up from our past meetings.  I have also managed to suffer a bad IT failure and currently cannot locate the  estimations and work preformed last term.  so sorry!

How is your monday?  11am?

Stay warm and happy 2024!
scott
