**CarolineE:**
Yeah, all good. Thank you. Just discussing the some question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns.

**ScottM:**
Good. How are you? Good. Yeah, it just never ends. It's just, it's just, yeah. Anyway.

**CarolineE:**
We feel your pain from the previous term anyway.

**ScottM:**
Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to colleagues, it seems that you're in the majority of Carolina that at least among people I talked to, this term is the heavy term compared to last term. So I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. And I'm very glad mine is over, so or yeah, you know.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah. So I saw your email, Scott. Thank you for prompting us. I think Celine and I were just discussing a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah, that won't really help us.

**ScottM:**
Great.

**CarolineE:**
But so there are two issues. There's the clean data that you need to be able to do anything. And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything. Are those the two main issues for you?

**ScottM:**
Yes, that's exactly right. And for whatever it's worth, I feel like we're really close. But yeah, that's exactly right, Caroline.

**SelimY:**
So, Doctor Moser, you have sent me last time and you taught me to do that bootstrapping. And so I also told to Caroline.

**Speaker:**
Yeah.

**SelimY:**
While we're waiting, I didn't do anything. When I saw your Tuesday, I said to you, I will send you something. Yeah, but I couldn't get. I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person like me and you.

**ScottM:**
That's okay.

**SelimY:**
So that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together. I will be on Monday on campus. Would you have time then?

**ScottM:**
Monday. Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon three or four.

**SelimY:**
Can you do before 1 PM or before noon?

**ScottM:**
No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1 PM. I think, hang on. I can't do it 1 PM until 2 PM and then from 3 PM until 4 PM and then from 5 PM until 6 PM. So I could do from 2 PM until 3 PM.

**ScottM:**
2 PM should work, yeah.

**SelimY:**
Yeah, that should work. On Monday.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, do you mind sending me a team's invite? We can meet where we can meet, my office, your office, coffee.

**SelimY:**
Let's meet in your office.

**ScottM:**
That's fine. But the main thing, the most urgent thing, I think, is this data issue. I just don't understand what's, did my question make sense or am I just confused?

**SelimY:**
Which question?

**ScottM:**
Yeah, exactly right. My question about the data and the code books.

**SelimY:**
You asked something about the code book and I think the code book that I had sent in end of November, this is also the latest one. This should be the most recent updated code book that we have. And then you had also a question about the referrals to phone numbers.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, it's, well, yeah, because the data, yeah, exactly.

**SelimY:**
Yeah, so for that is, in our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or ten, but we said we will only accept up to five. Yeah, just the first thing. The second information is, even if people have referred, let's say, seven people, five, it doesn't mean they have been successful.

**ScottM:**
No, of course. Right, of course.

**SelimY:**
So that's why, in order to understand how many referrals we had eventually, we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID, and at the wave, so that we can identify which person ID recruiter has successfully recruited or referred people.

**ScottM:**
I got that. And of course, really, the successful recruit referrals aren't the same as referrals, and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The issue is really just one of variables. It looks like some people refer up to nine people, and that's, or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine.

**SelimY:**
Up to ten, yeah.

**ScottM:**
But then there are these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be three phone numbers, and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number.

**SelimY:**
Yeah, so on the survey, people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone, and some other people could only refer three or four people.

**ScottM:**
That doesn't explain the gap.

**CarolineE:**
Let me share my screen if you don't mind, and probably easier to just look at it.

**SelimY:**
Please.

**ScottM:**
I have to figure out how to share my screen. Let's try that. Hopefully, that's working. Can you see my Excel?

**SelimY:**
Yeah.

**ScottM:**
These are great examples. Okay, so first let me pop over to the code book, and there's no coding after Q90. My understanding is that Q105 here, up to Q110, were the referrals that were used. So those were the coupons that were given. But then you've got this person who refers nine people. That's fine. That makes sense. But look at this person. This person refers three phone numbers, and then they refer six nothings, and then there's a phone number way over here. Or take this person. Their Q105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I just don't understand how this happens.

**SelimY:**
Yeah.

**ScottM:**
So for starters, is my understanding correct that this is the possible set of phone numbers? Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five, that we don't actually give the coupons, and that's great. And that's actually super helpful. But the reason I'm asking is because at our last meeting, we had this observation. I think Caroline had a great suggestion. But there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people. And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should fix that up. And that's right. And then I was thinking, well, hang on. That logic applies to everybody. So if you say you know two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give five phone numbers, that same logic applies. And we should still fix up that number. And so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give. And I, like, so for this row, what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is it four? Or can we not tell?

**SelimY:**
In that case that you have highlighted before.

**ScottM:**
Okay, good. Thank you.

**SelimY:**
It would be four people.

**ScottM:**
Okay, that's excellent. That's what I understand. And so and likewise so this for this other number would be nine. Yeah. Okay, so basically I shouldn't worry about the or the gaps or the ordering?

**SelimY:**
I think you shouldn't worry about gaps in between the phone number referrals. And if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the printed survey from the just system. So you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer. People were filled out.

**ScottM:**
That would be wonderful. Yes. Thank you. That's super wonderful. But now even this conversation is super helpful because now I know the number of phone numbers that a person gave. And that was the missing piece that I was I was. Yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess. But so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can. Oh, I'm going to take this off. And and that's great news. Thank you. I will. I will. How do I stop? I will. I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff. And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're virtually ready to go. Oh, the population estimate. Yes, Caroline, what were your thoughts on on that?

**CarolineE:**
I've been tracking the Europeans on this, and they have a category that they call personal household services PHS. And they've started to collect data on this. And it comprises two elements. So there's the just jotted down the details that I found. And they have social work without accommodation, which has a NAC code 88. And then they have an activities of households as employees of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97. Now that is also a sick code for the UK, this activities. So that's very closely linked to domestic workers. That second one is tightly bounded. An analysis that included UK figures from 2017. So it's not too far away. And it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000 respectively. The social work without accommodation is that bigger figure. And then the activities of households as employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure.

**ScottM:**
Excellent.

**CarolineE:**
So the paper, they've got some trends for other countries, and they, I mean, I think we could make an argument that they're broadly static.

**ScottM:**
Okay.

**CarolineE:**
You're saying we're not very sensitive. So the question then is, for us, do we want to combine them to have this that gives you the one million figure that I think, or roughly a million, or do we want to take this smaller lower number of 51,000 that's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure number is larger than that. It's 79,000.

**ScottM:**
Right.

**CarolineE:**
So.

**ScottM:**
So hang on. I think I misread you. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000.

**CarolineE:**
929,000.

**ScottM:**
Oh, wow. Okay. My mistake. And what were the codes again? I'm sorry. NAC? I don't know this.

**CarolineE:**
N-A-C-E. I don't know what it stands for. But N-A-C-E-88.

**ScottM:**
Okay.

**CarolineE:**
Which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an email. So,

**ScottM:**
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.

**CarolineE:**
That's all right. And N-A-C-E-97, which is this activities of households as employers of domestic personnel.

**ScottM:**
Which is that, yeah.

**CarolineE:**
So I think that probably can now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through Eurostat and try and pull out something more recent. But if, yeah, that's what I was hoping.

**ScottM:**
I agree.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
But that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range.

**ScottM:**
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
From we've got lower and upper limits, haven't we?

**ScottM:**
Yeah, exactly.

**CarolineE:**
But perhaps is the most.

**ScottM:**
Yep, I think that's a great idea.

**CarolineE:**
Conservative approach.

**ScottM:**
Yes, I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the, I don't know what, I'm sorry. I don't know where the 1.7 million came from. The, it's really, it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all. I haven't played with things as small as 50, 51,000. But I will. And I think you're right. I think the range, I think we say, you know, here's the number that we're using, site, site, site. In the appendix, here's the robot, here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change. And I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said, it was like from 900 to a million to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher, like nothing changes. So, so I, and I don't know about the lower. So I'll, but I'll play with this. So I think this is, please don't spend any more time on, I mean, please do save the citation. We can, we can, you know, site the site the site.

**CarolineE:**
Yes, I've logged it across in an email to you. Really, what I've just told you now. So we've got, we've got the link to the numbers.

**ScottM:**
Good. Okay. Well, I can, I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon. Should we meet next week or if, if Selene can get the, well, that's not entirely off. I can have everything except the in some polished by next Friday. And depending on how our meeting goes on Monday, Selene. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer. I don't know. But, but with the input, just from the input, just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure.

**CarolineE:**
That's great. Would a three o'clock meeting next week be all right?

**ScottM:**
Sure.

**CarolineE:**
I've got something in for two.

**ScottM:**
No problem.

**CarolineE:**
Already.

**ScottM:**
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
Does that work for you, Selene?

**SelimY:**
Yeah, as long as it's after afternoon is fine.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, so we said three.

**SelimY:**
Yeah, it's all right. It's fine for me.

**CarolineE:**
I'll send something across.

**SelimY:**
I also sent a meeting link.

**ScottM:**
Thank you.

**SelimY:**
Yeah.

**ScottM:**
Yeah. And so how, how do you, how should I prepare for this meeting? What are you?

**SelimY:**
I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions. Yeah. And some small questions. So that's fine. You can guide me. Sure. So you don't need to prepare anything. Just about that.

**CarolineE:**
Sure, that's fine.

**ScottM:**
Sure, sure, sure. Okay. All right. All right. Sounds, sounds sounds good. And thanks for, like I said, this was very helpful for me. So thanks. That's great.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah. No, it's just, it just is tantalizing now, isn't it? Cause it was, I think we, we get it, as you say, we're getting close. So close. It's really just, just delivering now.

**ScottM:**
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean it critically, Selene. Not at all. And in fact, I was, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything critical. It's just, I, I'm with Caroline, like we just, let's get it done. Let's get it done. We can, we can, we can do it. So thanks. Thanks so much. And I hope you have find some time to enjoy the weekend. And we'll talk in a week.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, good to see you.

**SelimY:**
Thanks, guys.

**ScottM:**
See you.

**SelimY:**
Bye, everybody.

**SelimY:** I came on last Saturday.

**ScottM:** Okay.

**CarolineE:** Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. How are you?

**SelimY:** Hi, good to see you.

**ScottM:** And you.

**SelimY:** Yeah, go ahead, please, Caroline. I'm not prepared.

**CarolineE:** Yeah, I was going to say, thank you for your email. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking. It's just a way of trying to keep an aid memoir, isn't it? Of where we're up to with this, really. So it was really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought.

**ScottM:** Yeah, I think so. We might have a path forward from what you're saying.

**CarolineE:** Yeah, honestly, that sounds really good. I had to write everything down because I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that email.

**ScottM:** Yeah. No, I'll keep talking while you're looking for it. Please, thank you. And interestingly, the Norck paper that you mentioned in it, I think that that is the first of two studies that they've done. Okay. And we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I shared with you was the second study they've done a cohort study. So now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional, but we've tried to track down both reports.

**CarolineE:** Small world, yeah.

**ScottM:** But I think we know what they're publishing anyway, and that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the Gile, is it Gile?

**CarolineE:** Yeah.

**ScottM:** But I will read that. And that will be useful for just putting the literature related to RDS together.

**CarolineE:** Yeah, I think so. And Selim has done a fantastic job, I think, in actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started. So I think we've made some pretty good progress this week.

**SelimY:** Good.

**CarolineE:** So I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings.

**SelimY:** Yes.

**CarolineE:** Like that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the email, Scott? Or do you want to chat with them? Chat about the risk assessment?

**ScottM:** Yeah, if you don't mind, please do. I'm so sorry. Yeah, so sorry, please, please.

**CarolineE:** Now, we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then.

**ScottM:** Right.

**CarolineE:** So what I tried to do, Selim, as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right, but there are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally. And Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning weight so that overall they would add up to one. That's effectively an index of no exploitation through to every form of exploitation we could think of. And we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there may be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process. But from what you're saying in your emails, Selim, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation.

**SelimY:** Yeah, that's right. So I have gone through these steps that you have sent me in your email last Friday, and they all, 97 people, you know, so we have some level of exploitation. And if you go to the Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night, you can see when you go to the column, some categories, so you can see that 0.366, 0.2, 0.1, and that continues. And as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13 categories that we have asked our respondents.

**ScottM:** Yeah. So the question that I had, and forgive me if I misunderstood this, but we, when we put the measures together, there were some that were sort of composite measures. So there were the 13 sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement, where there were two or three together. So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding, Selim, or have you just done a sort of all or nothing coding?

**SelimY:** I've done all or nothing coding. So is this the, I mean, I didn't attend last week the meeting. Is this a complication then?

**CarolineE:** Well, this is, I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this input. I mean, definitely, you've answered the first question was how many people in the sample experienced any form of exploitation and we know. Because of the way we've selected organisations to approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation, and not just generic people working in the sector. So that I think is good for our clarity of our method. And I suppose the question is, could we, or do we want to, do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got? Because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've designed the measures is just purely a cumulative sum. But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub-totals almost. I have a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run.

**ScottM:** I'm sorry.

**CarolineE:** How you, how you sort of conceptualise the risk index?

**ScottM:** First cup of coffee, so apologies to all, but I'm not exactly, so I see there's what 13 categories, is that right? Some number of categories. 13 categories, and Selim's, for each person, Selim's indicated the extent to which they fit in that category. And the categories in the Word document are, oh I see, the categories aren't individual questions, they're compilations of questions. Is that correct?

**CarolineE:** In some cases.

**ScottM:** In some cases.

**CarolineE:** It's not always, we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have.

**ScottM:** Okay, and then, so sorry, give me a second. So Selim, how did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet?

**SelimY:** So Caroline sent me the email, I think you have been also included in the same email, so I'm just, I think I'm just sharing it, this will solidify the communication. Can you see that?

**ScottM:** Yeah, that's exactly what I have, yeah.

**SelimY:** Yeah, so I, so going back to the question, let's start here. For example, this would be category one, yeah, category one, and we have our question, and for that question we have more answers in this survey. We don't have only yes, always, often, or sometimes there's also no, never, and so on. So, but as long as they answer one of these responses, they have been forced to do work against their will.

**ScottM:** Right. Back to the question.

**SelimY:** And that will be done, weighted with 0.25.

**ScottM:** Yeah.

**CarolineE:** What do you mean weighted by 0.25?

**ScottM:** So it's like 0.25 times 0.025.

**CarolineE:** 0.025.

**ScottM:** So that's a proportion of the total index of one. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk, so that there was a sort of cumulative effect.

**CarolineE:** So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding, Selim correctly, when you look at risk category one, Selim, that was designed to be those two questions together.

**SelimY:** Yeah.

**CarolineE:** And you see, because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability.

**SelimY:** Yeah.

**CarolineE:** So that would give you a composite weighting.

**ScottM:** So if you answered the first question, and in any of those responses, you get 0.25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further 0.25.

**SelimY:** Just make 0.05.

**ScottM:** Yeah.

**CarolineE:** Yeah, just what I have done.

**SelimY:** Yeah. So as Caroline and I said, we have your two questions. And if the respondent, our respondent has responded for both of these questions, then they will get a weighting for each 0.025. And some of this would be, for this question, 0.05. And that continues. So for all questions, so here, for example, would be, again, 0.05. Here we have, again, two questions. So it will be 0.025, 0.025. If they have been part of that indicator for exploitation, then they will get a weighting of 0.05. And this goes back to the overall index score of one. So from these, from these responses, I guess these are what I'm basing the, the, the, the, the exploitation weightings.

**ScottM:** Right. So basically, everybody has an exploitation risk index, which is somewhere between zero and one, right?

**SelimY:** Yeah, yeah.

**ScottM:** Is that? And you're able to say this category, this person, Scott, has a risk index of 0.25.

**CarolineE:** Yes.

**ScottM:** So that person has the exploitation risk index of 0.25.

**CarolineE:** Yeah.

**SelimY:** Yeah. And then, so, I mean, this is a sort of, so I guess I have to change 0.025 to 0.03 and recalculate the sum category and then share with, suppose of you.

**ScottM:** Yeah, is there anything else that I can help with?

**SelimY:** I don't think so, sorry.

**CarolineE:** Right. No, it's as long as I've got the node one, the node two, that that's important. No, it looks like the, what's weather exploitation. You've mentioned the email.

**ScottM:** I'm sorry.

**CarolineE:** Because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited.

**SelimY:** Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some fame, right? Right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So.

**ScottM:** By looking at that. It's that. They are all exploited some degree.

**CarolineE:** Got you. Right, which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got. The Yep. Nope. Bye. Ohh well there is one of them. I think we've already covered it. And that is what are the. It it if I'm gonna do that? Yeah, there is one. Very important thing. Thank you for. Thank you for that, Caroline. It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think book is set would be great, but which? If I wanted to dichotomize and say yes, you're in experiencing modern slavery. No, you're not. What questions? Plural, would I? What question should I use and and if there's more than one question, that's fine. Which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM. Seems like a pretty gold standard.

**ScottM:** Yeah, that's good. So they got and the forced labour ones as well are more indicative of forced of once slavery. It's that last the point. 11 which is it potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labour? Not necessarily modern slavery, so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator, they they could be exploited. It's labour exploitation, but it isn't. It isn't modern slavery.

**CarolineE:** Okay. And that's Q 36 five B1? And so I should use that one. And the NRM.

**ScottM:** Yeah, the only one is definitely well, as definitely as. You can be.

**CarolineE:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**ScottM:** Within our data, modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence.

**CarolineE:** Yeah, good point. And the 2 * 2. Anything else? Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable?

**ScottM:** Not that I can think of. Selim, have you got any anything you want to? Mention anything common? Use.

**SelimY:** I'm just. I I'm looking at the. Document I I don't think so.

**CarolineE:** OK, great. Good. Makes my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. OK. Thanks. Thanks as always everyone.

**ScottM:** Yeah. No, brilliant. Do you want to meet next week or give it? When do you want to? Catch up again.

**CarolineE:** Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so. Sorry, yeah.

**ScottM:** Are you around next Friday today?

**SelimY:** I for the next two weeks until the 22nd I might be not.

**ScottM:** Okay.

**SelimY:** Because my annual review is coming up.

**ScottM:** Okay.

**SelimY:** Yeah, I'm. I'm in the process of. Putting everything together.

**ScottM:** Right, OK, now that's fine. So it would be as well to have well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again. Probably at the beginning of December, when is your annual review.

**CarolineE:** I can't.

**SelimY:** On the 28.

**CarolineE:** I see.

**ScottM:** The 28th, so the beginning. Of December would be aware.

**SelimY:** 29 or 29th of November. Any day off on that one?

**ScottM:** Right. OK.

**SelimY:** 3rd of December, since it's a Friday, yeah.

**ScottM:** Is that a Friday again? Let me find my calendar too.

**CarolineE:** Sorry about that. Fire alarm business.

**ScottM:** Ohh OK, so we're suggesting Scott. Perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the 1st of December.

**CarolineE:** That works just if you don't mind sending me a team invite. That would be that would be great.

**ScottM:** Yeah, and and 12:00, is that still a good time?

**CarolineE:** Yeah, I'm flexible, so whatever. If another time works better for you. All that's that's fine for me.

**ScottM:** That's alright for me. What about you, Selim?

**SelimY:** 11 or 12 is fine.

**ScottM:** OK, let's go for 11, then I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft. So we've got some probably in the week before whatever stage it's in. I'll circulate it and and then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well.

**SelimY:** No. Ohh good.

**ScottM:** Right.

**CarolineE:** Sounds great. Thanks everyone.

**ScottM:** Alright, good. Good to speak to. You thank you getting fire alarm sorted out, OK.

**CarolineE:** All have a nice weekend. Yeah, me too. Talk to you later and you. Thank you. Bye.

**SelimY:** Have a good weekend.

**ScottM:**
Hello. Hi, can you hear me?

**CarolineE:**
Yes, we can hear you, yes.

**ScottM:**
Excellent. Sorry I'm late. I slipped my mind. I was at the coffee shop and then popped up. Anyway, sorry I'm late. Sorry, nice to see you all. How are you? Staying warm, I hope.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, great. How are you doing? Cause you were, I think you had a doctor's appointment last week. Are you OK?

**ScottM:**
Health better. Thank you. Yeah, I'm cold, but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it. But yeah, I've been marking hell. So how are you all?

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thank you. Yes, been doing a little bit of teaching, but just a couple of skills days for social policy social workers. So yeah, most of my teaching takes place next term, so I'll be buried next in semester 2.

**SelimY:**
I'm good.

**ScottM:**
Excellent. Well, so yeah. I'm the opposite. So I'm happy for you, but enjoy while you can. I haven't touched anything since we last talked, but that said, it's still probably a good idea to touch base and see what's next or where we are just so we don't sort of get off track. Thanks a ton for the draft.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it. So it is a first draft, it's not polished, but I thought to capture some of the ideas whilst they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and Selim might be able to contribute like sections of text. So hopefully I'm not asking you to put in anything that you're not able and willing to contribute.

**ScottM:**
No, that's great. Thank you. I missed that though. Can you? What? What? I don't have it open. What? So I mean, obviously, the result, the methods and the results, but yeah.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, so I've got some methodology down there, but you're closer to the detail of what you're doing. So yeah, methodology and results, that's it. And then once we've got that in, we can revisit the discussion.

**SelimY:**
That's great. Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
And I've put some points down, but there will obviously be more coming out when we've got a fuller paper to work with. The other thing I'm aware that is outstanding is you'd asked us if, given the quite high proportion that we're coming out with, whether we could just look at some simple statistics to see whether that proportion seemed sensible. Selim, have you seen that email? Is that something you might be able to do?

**SelimY:**
For us, you mean the article?

**CarolineE:**
No, Scott's last email about taking, just doing a sense check against the proportion figure that he's finding.

**SelimY:**
No, I didn't. I told you just now. But also for you, Dr. Moser. So I had in the last 2-3 weeks my annual review, the preparation, and also the exam. That's why I didn't have time with anything else. But it went well. So I passed the annual review and yeah, so just update me quickly, Caroline, please.

**CarolineE:**
I'll forward you the email from Scott because I've got it, and then if you can just take it. It's not a big job, I don't think. But if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your findings. I mean, Scott's very kindly indicated which questions it relates to. So it's literally a percentage, I think, isn't it, Scott?

**ScottM:**
Yeah, the issue is just that we've got these fancy schmancy techniques which are great, and very preliminarily, I, and this was weeks ago, I... Since then, and I only had one cup of coffee today, so this is all danger. But the sort of where I parked it mentally is we have some initial estimates using these sort of next-generation snowball samples, for lack of a better phrase, and that is not a very good phrase. And doing that gave some really high numbers, at least it seemed to me, really high numbers. So I was just thinking aloud to Caroline, and I'd welcome any and all inputs, is just like, what if we don't do fancy schmancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the proportion in the sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern slavery? Like, what is that number? I don't know that number. And whatever that number is, it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have a random sample, etc., etc., etc. But just as something to compare to. I don't remember the exact numbers. Caroline, do you remember? It was in the thousands, though, wasn't it?

**CarolineE:**
Well, it was a proportion that you gave us, wasn't it? It was sort of 30% or something.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, that's right, that's right. Which just sounds really high. I mean, again, it's the proportion of my group of domestic workers who I think, yeah, plausibly we can say even a subset of those that are from the Philippines or from Latin America. I think because that we're not explicitly sampling that population, but it's sort of implicitly sampling that population. And so that percentage just seemed to sound high to me, but I don't know anything about this.

**CarolineE:**
Well, it's possible because they have no protection. And that's what I think it is possible. I think it would attract interest. So it would be good to be as sure as we can about what we're saying because this seems to be quite an interest. There's a lot of interest in this topic.

**ScottM:**
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
When Selim and I published the preliminary report just looking at the descriptive statistics, we got a lot of media attention for that. So that was not really as exciting as what we're doing here. So I'm sure there would be continued interest from, I mean, there's Jeremy Ball at East Midlands Today, he's sort of following our work at the Rights Lab. He always keeps an eye on what press releases we create. So he would, I'm sure, pick it up again.

**ScottM:**
That's great.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, it is. I mean, from an impact point of view, it's great. And I think there have been a couple of gray literature reports. I'd include ours in that, but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has produced a report, but it's just descriptive statistics like us. So this really does move the conversation forward.

**ScottM:**
That's great if there's...

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, with the change of government, if we presumably get the change of government, then there's a task force charged with looking at this issue within the first 100 days. So it's potentially got policy impact. Andrea Rainer is leading something on this that a colleague at Nottingham Trent mentioned to me, so this is the sort of thing that her team would be interested in picking up as well. So it could be really timely.

**ScottM:**
This is fantastic. I really want to be done with grading and get back to this. This is really exciting. And that's what I was going to say is that I wasn't aware of these advocacy groups. I wasn't aware of the specificity, like you mentioned, there's a Latin American Women's... And obviously, you are connected to that, but that's great. The more we're having this conversation, once we start sort of subsetting it down, the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this conversation, so that's very exciting if true. But OK, there's a big caveat, and the big caveat there is... So thank you, Caroline, again for the opportunity. And I completely agree with you that if we can do some quanti stuff with this, yeah, that would be, you know, the literature way better than I do. But that's a contribution. It makes me a little bit anxious because it makes me think like, OK, well, we really got to get these numbers right then because this isn't something that... There's a pool of this kind of quanti prevalence estimation that we can sort of, you know, we're close or we're not so close, so it's different. But here's why it's pretty new.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I agree. When Bernard Silverman produced the stats, the initial stats for modern slavery in the UK, he used multiple systems estimation to do that. And he produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by policymakers, which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end, in that the situation was far worse than his estimation suggested. So I think you're just part of the conversation, but the conversation keeps evolving. The estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that are not correct, but that are a way of engaging people in the debate. So I think as long as we're clear about what we've done, how we've got to that, I think we're OK.

**ScottM:**
That's a really... I think that's a really great perspective, and not one that I had. So just to paraphrase, you're saying... Well, I mean, essentially, that's how science works: you make some estimates, you do some research, and then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed or whatever. And I think I was approaching it kind of timidly, like, well, I've got to make sure this number is right or this method is really justified. And I think you're right, that's sort of not... That's a luxury we don't have in this particular research domain. And that's just... That's that, right? That's not a sin against us. That's a nice perspective. I like that. Thank you for that, Caroline.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, I think it's just listening to Bernard talk about his experience. I mean, he said the number of slaves was between 11 and 13,000, and then later estimates suggested up to 148,000. That was quite a significant change in the number, but his paper started that conversation. So I think it's just viewing it as this is a contribution to the debate based on these particular methods.

**ScottM:**
Right. Right. Sounds good. OK, so when I get time, when I'm out of marking hell, what's the next step or help reorient me, please, as to what I can do?

**CarolineE:**
I think it's trying to flesh out that draft, so I can go back to it and polish up what I've written and make sure that it... Because it's not a bit less stream of consciousness, but actually it needs input from you and Selim as well to be a fully rounded piece. The skeleton is there, and I suppose we also need to think a little bit. Once you've had a chance to have a look at it, Scott, perhaps where you think we might target it and whether it needs the sort of context setting to appeal to the audience of the journal that we think we want to go for.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, good. OK, thank you. That's helpful.

**CarolineE:**
And I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in Word, and I think you understand LaTeX, don't you? So it might be better actually to write it in LaTeX, which I've never used. But perhaps if we can get the draft up to a certain standard, you would be able to then transfer it for us.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, absolutely. That's fine, actually. Back in the day, you're right, that was a real barrier, but nowadays there's lots of conversions. It's really pretty straightforward to convert. So we can still talk to each other, should be OK.

**CarolineE:**
That's right.

**ScottM:**
But yeah, that's a good point. Selim, do you mind taking a step? I don't know what lit review in terms of the methods needs or is desired, but do you feel comfortable taking a stab at that? I think I've sent along at this point... If you scroll the trove of emails I've sent, I think there's... And Caroline as well, a number of papers that address the kinds of methods that we're using.

**SelimY:**
I have written down for now the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the methods section in the article that Caroline sent, and the second task is the forwarded email. So it seems there are some tasks... I just had a glance into it, looked into the email that Caroline just forwarded, and there's a request from you, Dr. Moser. You're asking for some information from my end, so I will look into that.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, the method section of the paper I've already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies. So there's a method section there.

**ScottM:**
That's great.

**CarolineE:**
I've asked you specifically if you could add the network structure graphic. You remember that we put that actually visualizes the structure of the network and the extent to which it's constructed of different waves. So that was that section. If you could put that section in. And then I've asked Scott if he could include the point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated. And then the bit that needs drafting in terms of the method is the data analysis, which I think Scott is best placed to draft.

**ScottM:**
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
Because you know what you've done. Those areas are indicated in the paper. I've just put them in bold, so you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier.

**ScottM:**
Thank you. That's great.

**CarolineE:**
And then obviously I can polish up the text, but I don't want to spend too much time doing that until the results...

**ScottM:**
Yeah, until we know whether it sort of hangs together as an overall narrative, yeah.

**SelimY:**
OK.

**ScottM:**
Thank you very much, Caroline. I see it. I see what has to be done, and I don't have time to do it today.

**CarolineE:**
Yes, that's the big problem, isn't it? I could do my part over the weekend, and also in the beginning of next week. So I'm more free.

**ScottM:**
Great. Excellent.

**CarolineE:**
Is your timetable get a bit better in the new year, then, Scott? Is that going to be, yeah.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, it gets better until about... I have one of these intensive things, and I plan to work. So things will get a lot better for me mid-next week, and I plan to return to research fiercely then. But yeah, for about... Not quite a week, but essentially next week, I'm... Yeah, anyway, I see what has to be done. I can't wait to do it. And I'm so sorry, but I simply can't right now.

**CarolineE:**
No, no, that's... I mean, I completely understand, the teaching is something you can't ignore.

**ScottM:**
And marking... So many, so many, so many.

**CarolineE:**
Yes. Yeah, I feel your pain.

**ScottM:**
I'll sadly... I don't know, for better... So I'll probably work over parts of the break, probably until late December. I'll work on this likely over the break and I'll probably send emails. I hope you don't read them because I hope you're with your family.

**CarolineE:**
I'll try not to. My January is not too bad. So if we can...

**ScottM:**
OK.

**CarolineE:**
... reconvene, perhaps in January. Does that suit you too, Selim?

**SelimY:**
Yeah, I could do online because or even in person. I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week, but we could also meet online, so there's no problem. Yeah, online or doesn't matter.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah. OK.

**ScottM:**
So would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've got something in the diary to work to?

**SelimY:**
Yeah, let's do so. Ideally before the 15th of January maybe.

**CarolineE:**
What?

**ScottM:**
Agreed.

**CarolineE:**
Do you want to pick a... Is Friday still going to be good for you, Scott?

**ScottM:**
I mean, until teaching starts, I think... I don't even know my timetable for next term, but yeah, Fridays should be fine. So, I think I'll be traveling until the 4th. So I don't know, maybe...

**SelimY:**
Add the 12th. Friday the 12th?

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, the 12th, what's that like?

**ScottM:**
Sure.

**CarolineE:**
And does this time work?

**ScottM:**
Looks great for me.

**CarolineE:**
Does a meeting at this time work?

**SelimY:**
Yeah, it works for me. 11:00 AM again.

**ScottM:**
Great, good.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, let's put that in and then we'll see where we are. That's great. That's a great deadline, and that definitely gives me enough time to... That's great. That's a great deadline for me. Thank you.

**ScottM:**
And Selim, if you just add your section into the current document that's in the shared file, then we've got one shared copy that we're all working on. That would be great.

**SelimY:**
We have done that before, so should be fine.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, we sort of know what we're doing with that, so that's great.

**ScottM:**
Oh yeah, since it's on the share or the OneDrive. Is that right?

**CarolineE:**
Yes, it is. It's not in the folder that you set up though, Scott, because I don't seem to have access to put things in there, but it is on the OneDrive.

**ScottM:**
OK, good.

**CarolineE:**
The link's in the email. I can resend it if you think that would be useful.

**ScottM:**
Couldn't hurt. I'm sure I have it. But if you don't mind, that would be great. Yeah, thank you.

**CarolineE:**
Alright, let me see if I can hunt it out.

**ScottM:**
Or don't worry about it. I mean, I put all of our stuff in its own folder so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, we'll just see if I can find it. Here we are. OK. Right. I just resent the email, so that should be somewhere at the top of your inbox now.

**ScottM:**
Brilliant. Thanks a ton. Oh, good. This is great. So like I said, I like this deadline. And now I must return to marking, yeah.

**CarolineE:**
Yes, and you might need more coffee.

**ScottM:**
I absolutely do. So please, please, please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because vicariously is the only way I will get to enjoy it.

**SelimY:**
So, Dr. Moser, I have been told by another academic staff that during these two weeks of marking, treat yourself. Eat the candies, eat fast food, or just treat yourself from the marking stress.

**ScottM:**
That's great. I will, thank you. I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well. Thank you.

**CarolineE:**
OK, won't hold you anymore then. Good catch-up. I'm glad you're feeling better.

**ScottM:**
Really great to see you all and I look forward to proceeding.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, let's see if we can get something in the new year. Good. See you.

**SelimY:**
And you.

**ScottM:**
Bye. Happy holidays, everyone. Take care.

**CarolineE:**
Thank you. Bye.

### Improved Full Response with Complete Combined Transcript

* * *

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, like, yeah. OK, that sounds fantastic. So in terms of journal targets, I mean, the question is, I suppose, within the business school, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list. The school signed up to the Dora principles, that it's not all about journal destination, but it is a factor. So one of the first places to look for potential journal targets is that list.

**ScottM:**
But I tend to publish anywhere, so I have not really been following the rules very strictly, and I don't know what your publication targets might look like. So I'm quite happy to be ecumenical about this, and not necessarily pick a journal off that list just because that's what you're supposed to do. But having said that, there is one journal potentially, which is a three-star journal, so it's not absolutely top quality, but it's reputable, called Work, Employment and Society, which has a strong theoretical basis. So I don't know whether... well, that would mean that I would need to do some background work on. They definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's sort of sociologically focused. And the advantage is one of the editor-in-chiefs is actually Marek Kozlinski, who is, yeah, who's obviously at the business school. So I could sound him out and just say, would you accept a sort of... how would you view a sort of statistically oriented paper in the domestic workers sphere? Is that something that you think might fall within the scope of the journal? So that was the target that sort of occurred to me, but I'm very open to publishing where it would suit you, Scott.

**ScottM:**
I mean, I think the ABS list is a great place to start because I know nothing about this field at all. But it sounds like, I mean, yeah, more stars is better in general for me, but at the same time, like I'm not, like you, Caroline, like I'm not picky about these things. But, you know, my general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down the tiers as the rejection letters come in, which in my case, they fill up my mailbox. So that would be, yeah. So, I mean, ABS, look at the sort of best-ranked that are appropriate for, you know, labor, domestic work, UK, human rights, whatever, and start there and yeah, work our way down.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know, how does that sound for you?

**SelimY:**
Yeah, I'm OK taking time and doing the start high and move down approach. And when’s the next... do we know when the ref cycle ends?

**CarolineE:**
Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's ref 2029 now. But when the actual deadline for paper submissions is, I don't know, but I mean, we've got enough time to try a higher journal and then knock down to it. So I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars. If you think we'd like to start with that.

**ScottM:**
That would be my preference if that's it. If there's, yeah, that would be my preference. I like you, I don't have time constraints. Somewhere like the British Journal of Management, that's a very highly regarded journal, does have, in my view, a bit of a quantitative bias. So that might work in our favor. And I can have a bit of a search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But I mean, the fact that it's UK statistics might be quite appropriate for them. We just might need to sort of cite it in their literature to sort of see what debates they're talking about. So that's a bit of work for me to do. And then, yeah, see what I mean. I asked our Dean and Alex to our terms about this. And he suggested research policy and science.

**CarolineE:**
OK.

**ScottM:**
Neither of those journals I know anything about. I did look at the aims and scope and to me, didn't seem to fit. But that was his initial suggestion. I don't know if you know anything about science.

**CarolineE:**
Science is absolutely top. But yeah, it's a strange fit. I wouldn't, I think of them as doing more like biology kinds of stuff. I mean, basically, what they do is like really, really high-profile stuff, regardless of field. And so maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is high-profile, maybe. But yeah, it’s an odd suggestion, to be honest with you.

**ScottM:**
Yeah. I've heard of you. Do you know anything about research policy?

**CarolineE:**
No, but I think policy sounds like a good, a good class of journals to maybe target. Although we don't really have any policy implications currently, but that could be strengthened perhaps.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, that brings to mind another journal called Millbank Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're ABS. That's possible from a policy point of view, but maybe British Journal of Management is better.

**CarolineE:**
Excellent.

**ScottM:**
So, and then I suppose work, employment, and society, if we fail with BJM, it's like the next tier down, but still respectable.

**CarolineE:**
Good.

**ScottM:**
Excellent. Excellent. That's great. That's great. That's great.

**CarolineE:**
That sounds all right.

**ScottM:**
Sounds great for me.

**CarolineE:**
So if I do a bit of a literature search, the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until April.

**ScottM:**
That's fine.

**CarolineE:**
And I've got seminar weeks coming up. So, and my diary is absolutely chock block. So the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days, I think I could perhaps spend some time. Actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well. So I can do, make a start on that then. And then, so at least get you sort of some indication and yeah, but we, I think British Journal of Management does seem to be quite a good fit. And that's a good journal.

**ScottM:**
Excellent.

**CarolineE:**
If we get into that...

**ScottM:**
Let's start there. Let's start there.

**CarolineE:**
I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week because like you, the next two to three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff. But reading week has been good and I'm making progress. So I'm going to make a push to try to get, you know, the results done.

**CarolineE:**
Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team. It's really, really, really, really great.

**ScottM:**
It's been fantastic working with the both of you. So thank you.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah, so it'd be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah, if we were to aim to do that for the summer, is that too, is that all right?

**ScottM:**
I think by the time we sort of tidied everything up.

**CarolineE:**
Yeah.

**ScottM:**
Yeah, June, I think was a good target.

**CarolineE:**
And July, if we get, if we miss, you know, I think that's a, I think it's very feasible as well.

**ScottM:**
I mean, like I said, the right sort of April, we'll be able to come back to it and polish and then, you know, yeah.

**CarolineE:**
And I'm hoping next term might be quite as bad as this term. I'll have a little bit, it'll be just marking then.

**ScottM:**
Just marking. It just never ends. It just never ends.

**CarolineE:**
So but OK, this is great. I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll email you with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the, I'm not expecting any surprise. So the RDS stuff is done, done. And then the insum, I don't know. I'm not expecting to be surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see.

**CarolineE:**
Fantastic. Really, really good. Was there anything from you Selim that you wanted to share with us?

**SelimY:**
I have two points. First, Dr. Moser, do you have anything that you need from my side other than the sort of references?

**ScottM:**
That's it.

**SelimY:**
And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We started with BigBot. You may have seen my email that I don't want to be included in the publication for this research. What do you think about that?

**ScottM:**
I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your PhD advisor, Dr. Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need, if you want to stay in academia, you need publications. And in the past, you've mentioned sort of wanting to fortify your quantitative credentials. And this would certainly help with that. I mean, I think I understand his point. If I'm not saying this point, it's something like branding, like you don't want to get labeled as something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just, you need publications and full stop.

**SelimY:**
So I wasn't from Dr. Randall. I have to say it's not from Dr. Randall. It's from the mentor in the US when I spent time there, because I'm still having meetings with the professor there. And I see he is also the Dean of the department for international relations and politics. And recently we had another meeting and he told me it would be not good if I have a profile that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that. And I, and I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I don't include my name.

**ScottM:**
I mean, it's one, it's your decision. And of course, I completely, I completely respect that. And I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was Dr. Randall. You might run by him then in that case, get his opinion, because he's a proper IR theory person and see what, have you discussed it with him?

**SelimY:**
No, we'll meet on Tuesday. So I will brace this up then.

**ScottM:**
OK. Because I was saying to Celine, we could perhaps acknowledge him. If he's so sure that he doesn't want to be included in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I just wanted to perhaps it was an Indian idiosyncrasy of the American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would just caution you to find out, Celine, whether it's in a matter he's talking from an American's perspective.

**CarolineE:**
When that the same applies in Europe, if that's where you want to end up.

**SelimY:**
All my supervisors are American. Dr. Mosa, Dr. Randall, also the drug supervisor.

**CarolineE:**
Sorry. But for sure. I mean, I think sort of the bottom line is it's your decision, of course. And I think I can speak truthfully to say that like, you've definitely contributed a lot. And I think, yeah, you deserve to be credited in some way.

**ScottM:**
And thank you. I mean, you've done a lot to help with the project. So yeah, thank you.

**SelimY:**
Thank you too that I could learn from both of you. I still have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will update you both after I speak to my first supervisor, Dr. Randall. Yeah.

**CarolineE:**
OK. Brilliant. Thanks then. Thanks everyone. Have a great week. Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on email from now on?

**ScottM:**
Yeah, I think email is probably good. April.

**CarolineE:**
OK. Right, that's super. Let's stick with that then. Thanks everyone.

**ScottM:**
Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.

**CarolineE:**
Bye.

**SelimY:**
Bye. Bye.

Hello. Hi, Caroline. This is Scott, obviously. I'm really sorry for missing our Monday meeting. I've been, and still am, in administrative duties hell—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday—and then I returned to marking hell. So, I have done some work and wanted to try and update you. My typing is quite poor, and my spelling is even worse, so I thought it would be quicker just to send you a recording. Here’s a somewhat organized summary of where I'm at and what I was hoping to discuss with you on Monday. Again, I apologize for missing that meeting.

So, let’s bring it up. Here we go. I think the first thing for me when re-approaching this is to start with conceptualization and population, which I’ll call the setting. The first question is: what is the population? I think we have a very clear answer to that—it’s domestic workers in the UK. More technically, it’s domestic workers in the UK who have a mobile phone during the survey fielding. Maybe it’s domestic workers who have had a mobile phone in the calendar year preceding the survey fielding, something like that.

If that’s the population we’re sampling from, which I believe it is, then I think that’s very well defined, and that’s fantastic. The target population, this hidden population, so to speak, consists of domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone and have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There are a few ways we can operationalize that. You and Selim, and a little bit myself, but really it was mostly you, have come up with three very principled ways to do this.

The first two are dichotomies. So, this would be Question 36 dichotomized. This is simply: “Do you get paid less than the legal minimum wage?” And Question 80 also dichotomized, which is: “Have you been through the National Referral Mechanism, or have you been referred to the National Referral Mechanism?” To my mind, these are both very high bars. If people answer “yes” truthfully to either of those questions, I think—and I'm not an expert in this field whatsoever—but I think we can be very confident that, yes, that person counts as a member of the hidden population.

I think that’s true. We also discussed—and you and Selim, mainly you, developed—a continuous measure. So here, the idea is conceptually different. In this third idea, which I think is called... sorry, I took notes, and clearly, I... this is like the sum categories or sum cut. The idea is that you developed a series of indicators—sounds like eight or 12 or 16—and we just sort of normalized them and said, “How many of these indicators?” And actually, there was a weighting to them, “Do you satisfy?” And then we were going to come up with some number between zero and one that represents your exposure to the risk of experiencing modern slavery.

So, if we use that as a measurement, as a separate measurement, as a continuous measurement—not of experiencing modern slavery, but of the risk of experiencing modern slavery—that might sound like I'm splitting hairs, but I think methodologically, in terms of dichotomies versus continuous, but more importantly, conceptually, those are quite different. Because in the latter case, if we claim that we’re measuring the risk of exposure, then I think the population needs to be a little bit redefined. The population we’re sampling from is still domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, yada, yada, yada. But in this third continuous operationalization of experiencing modern slavery—or more formally, risk, let’s call it a risk index, and I've called it like 24 different things, and I apologize—but in that world, we’re asserting that everyone in the population has some value of this variable. That is to say, everyone in the population—domestic workers in the UK that we’re sampling from—has some risk of experiencing modern slavery. That risk might be zero, okay, fine. But again, conceptually, I think that’s important.

So, I don’t know if that’s correct or not, but that’s where I'm at—that’s where I started. So, we’ve got the population, we’ve got the target population. Now, how are we sampling? Where is this data coming from? We spent a few rounds and months on this, but I think it was productive, although perhaps not what you wanted to hear, or I wanted to hear, or whatnot. But I think where we landed was, well, look, what do we have? We have a convenience sample. We have an RDS sample—a respondent-driven survey in which the respondents are members of the population. We’re sampling from domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, right? Yada, yada, yada. We’re sampling from that population. Initially, there are seeds, and then we’re doing an RDS with five coupons to branch out to do the RDS or the modified snowball—not exactly snowball—whatever.

Again, these are my beliefs, so please, right, correct me if I'm wrong. That’s the data we have to work with. Now the question is, what do we do with that data? I want to add one additional aspect to the sample, separate that from the data we’re talking about in a second. Functionally, the sample comes from three groups, or we’re sampling from three subgroups within the population of domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone. Those are people from the Philippines—maybe they’re here on a visa, maybe they just identify as Filipino. Latinx, again by self-identified origin, ethnicity—I don’t remember the exact wording—and other, and British-born. That one, British-born, I think pretty sure is actually asked. I don’t have the question number on me. So, if we wanted to, we could say, okay, well, look, within this sample, there are three distinct clusters by nationality. I think we could assert that with veracity.

It’s been a long few days, and it’s only Tuesday. I apologize. So, these natural three subgroups or clusters—Latinx, Filipino, and British-born, I think. All right, that’s the sample. Let me... we’ve got... I hope you’re drinking a lot of tea or coffee and pausing and/or deleting this video. Before I get to the analysis, I want to address a few data issues. One, do we know anything about these sizes? Do we know anything about estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK? I found two websites—one’s official, the UK’s nationalcareers.service.gov.uk job groups. They sort of... I'm guessing it’s census-based, but they have these job groupings. And another is from some organization in the UK called BICS—I’ve already forgotten what that stands for. But it looks like there’s some sense of the number of domestic workers in the UK. It depends on how you count—is this home cleaning, is it daycare, is it institutionalized, is it not? Like I said, this is just a very preliminary thing.

That’s one—numbers. One A—numbers. Actually, we could estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from your very clever sample because of the RDS nature. One of the questions in the survey is, “How many other domestic workers do you know in the UK?” and then it asks for some recruitment information. But just asking the “how many.” So basically, what I'm saying is, we’re sampling from the population of domestic workers in the UK, and one of the questions is, “How many other people in this population do you know?” We can use that information to estimate the size of the population, where the population means domestic workers in the UK.

So that’s another... I’m exploring that currently as a possible additional source of information. By the way, that is using older... I’m just saying this for the record, sorry. So that’s using sort of the Guile et al., the early stuff—2010, 2011 stuff. The stuff we’ll talk about in a second for analysis is a bit later, 2014, 2015, a bit later. What I'm saying is, the population—we can try and estimate the size of the number of domestic workers in the UK, which might be of interest for a number of reasons. For me, it’s of interest because we need that number for later calculations, and that can come from a few sources. I found two online—maybe they’re valid, maybe they’re not. The third is, we could try and estimate that from your survey. I'm working on that currently, but it’s giving weird answers—like it’s way too small, and it’s taking way too long to run. So whatever, I'm just saying that for the record.

Now, I don’t remember what number we’re up to—analysis. Step one, let’s just take it from the literature. Let’s do the Guile et al. This is the so-called SSPS—successive sampling population size estimates. Krista Guile, who—again, small world—we were neighbors during our postdoc, comes up with this very clever way of exploiting additional information within RDS samples that essentially takes into account... What’s really cool about it is that it uses the wave at which you appeared in the sample as an additional piece of information. The idea being that those with larger personal networks—so, if I'm a seed and I give two recruits, odds are those two recruits have bigger social networks than, say, the other people that I didn’t recruit. Basically, that’s the idea, and so on and so forth.

So it uses this idea, which overcomes—it mitigates—a lot of biases that were in so-called RDS1 and RDS2. I’ve also seen it called RDSA and RDSB, volts, etc., etc., etc. So this SSPSC seems to be, as far as I can tell, pretty state of the art. So we can just take that from the literature. We can do estimation—there are a few hiccups, but nothing that we can’t overcome—and we get proportions. We get proportions of the population, which currently we don’t know the size of, but we can come up with some sensible ways of estimating it. That are experiencing—that are in the hidden population, that are experiencing modern slavery, however defined, via Q36 or Q80, both dichotomized, which again, to my mind, are very high bars. If you’re saying yes to either Q36 or Q80, again dichotomized, if you’re answering honestly, there’s very, very good reason to think that you’re a member of the hidden population—that you’re a domestic worker in the UK with a mobile phone that is being exploited, that is experiencing modern slavery.

We can do that, and there’s some very, very recent—most recent I found was the McLaughlin et al., 2023—I don’t even know if I’ve sent it around, sorry if I haven’t—that says, yeah, yeah, that’s great. But essentially, the number of people that I report... It’s really clever. It says basically, the number... I might not know the number of people that I know, so the number of people that I report shouldn’t be taken too literally. Essentially, what they do is they just add a measurement error component. They say, yeah, well, you might not actually know—you might not truthfully report the number of people that you know that are in your personal network, that are in our world, that are domestic workers in the UK that have such and such characteristics.

So we can do all that, and I have done that, and the answer is really high proportions—something like 30 to 40%, depending on which question we use, priors, which model, etc., etc. But pretty consistently 30 to 40%. Sorry, let me say it differently. Concurrent with the preliminary stuff I sent, whatever it was, months ago, something like 30-40% of domestic workers in the UK—if that’s the population—we are estimating to be experiencing modern slavery, again, depending on how we’re defining it. It’s one of these two dichotomous variables. There are caveats, however. I will say this—I was worried about a few things because when I first saw that, I thought, wow, that’s really high. So maybe there are some convergence issues—it doesn’t look like it. It looks like things have converged pretty well.

This is embarrassing. This reminds me that when I was younger, my parents would call me on voicemail, and sometimes my dad especially would just ramble, and the voicemail would cut off—he would have expired the maximum amount of time. I think that just happened to me—I’ve been rambling at you for more than the allotted time that Microsoft is letting me, and yet here I go again. So I’ll do my best to try and send along some kind of summary transcript. I'm sorry—this is me trying desperately to stay current and catch up on research, of which this is literally the number one priority, and you see that I'm already falling behind. So I'm really sorry about that.

Okay, right, blah, blah, blah. Where were we? So there are these estimates, and they seem... I believe them more than I did when I first sent the preliminaries around. Now, there’s still stuff to do—robustness, this, that, and the other—but these numbers seem pretty high. Okay, again, 30-40%, something like that. Now, there are a few caveats here—well, I need to say caveats. There are a few things I need to say.

The first is, I should have said earlier, isn’t about the analysis—it’s about the data and data cleaning. So, one thing, and much appreciation to Selim—he’s done a ton of work—but one is, and this turns out to be a bit of a subtle issue, at least in political science, so one is how do you deal with the “don’t knows”? Some of the questions, for example, one of our indicator questions about “Are you in this hidden population?”—“Are you experiencing modern slavery?”—is about referral to the National Referral Mechanism. And one of the response answers is “I don’t know.” So the issue is, how do you deal with those? And those “I don’t know” answers pop up, obviously, in lots of other questions.

Currently, in Selim’s formulation, they’re being coded as negative—“No, I’m not, whatever the question is asking.” Something just happened, oh my god, I feel like I'm one of the worst colleagues. I'm so sorry. An alternative approach is to classify them as missing. So essentially, you say, well look, if a person reports, “I don’t know if I've been referred to the National Referral Mechanism,” we’re just going to ignore you for purposes of analysis. We’re not going to count you as “No, I haven’t been referred.” So doing that actually weirdly increases, very slightly, the estimates of domestic workers in the UK experiencing modern slavery. So, Selim’s descriptive statistics were... If you do what I'm suggesting, which is to treat the “don’t knows” differently from either an affirmative or a negative, you get ever so slightly higher descriptive statistics—higher proportions just raw from the sample data. And it’s something, you know, it’s like 42-44, 42-43, or something like this. I mean, they’re not huge.

That’s one issue. Two—this one’s a bit trickier—17 out of 97 people in the sample report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK. One of the questions that—in fact, the question, I should be more clear, I'm sorry, Caroline, I'll try and clean this up in the transcript—in the summary of the transcript, they say, “I know zero people in the population,” which we’ve defined to be, if I'm thinking about this correctly, domestic workers in the UK. Right. Okay, so maybe they do, maybe that’s true, or maybe they don’t, but then in terms of this data cleaning business... But then some of them make referrals. So among the 17 that say, “I know zero domestic workers in the UK,” there’s another question that says, “Please give us the cell phone number of a domestic worker in the UK that you know, where ‘know’ is defined properly per your survey,” and they’ll give a cell phone number or two. Which again, this is a logical inconsistency. If you report a referral, and a referral must be a domestic worker in the UK, then you cannot know zero domestic workers in the UK.

So there are a few people in the survey like that. Essentially, what I'm saying is those zeros should actually be something positive. We don’t actually know, but a conservative answer would be to turn those zeros into ones. So I haven’t done that, but it’s a handful of people. I can’t imagine it’s going to matter, but there’s a larger issue, which is what to do with these zeros. So if a person in the sample claims they know zero domestic workers in the UK—and like I said, there are 17 or so out of 97, so it’s not nothing—what do we do with those? The reason I say that is because the estimators that I've been using essentially can’t handle the zeros. The reason for that—I hadn’t thought very deeply about it, but I guess it kind of makes sense in the following way—the estimators that we’re dealing with extensively rely on social network information. So if there’s a person in your sample that says, “I don’t have a social network—zero,” then that causes some problems because the entire estimation strategy of these different techniques is to exploit or use whatever social network there is. But if that’s zero, then something breaks. And to be honest, I haven’t worked through the math.

So what do we do with those? We could remove them—turns out that doesn’t really matter too much. We could try other techniques—I haven’t fully explored that. I’ve explored that a little, and I don’t really know what to make of it. Or we could just really add hoc—just add one to everybody’s reported degree. So all the zeros turn into ones, all the fives turn into sixes. That’s not principled whatsoever, but it’s another approach. Okay, so that’s data stuff.

All right, now, with regard to results—which again, I've completely misordered this, and hopefully, it will be temporarily correct in the accompanying outline, should I get around to producing it—so this 30-40% business that I mentioned earlier, like I said, I believe it more than I did when I sent you the initial preliminary results, which were relatively similar. The little convergence results—so we have this estimate that’s doing a lot of math. The idea is it comes up with lots and lots and lots of estimates, but when all these estimates get very, very close to each other, the algorithm stops and says, “Okay, here it is.” So you can look and see, does it actually do that? The answer is yes. It converges.

So I'm relatively... I'm more confident in the numbers on resolve that. Okay, so what am I... I'm sorry, I need to look at... right. So the number one is just, do we believe these results? I’ve checked convergence preliminarily, it looks pretty good. We could do sensitivity analysis—that would be on me. I’ve done a little bit of that, and again, it seems, in my opinion, surprisingly robust. I don’t remember my discussion about frequentist versus Bayesian, but the idea is you put some prior information into this estimator, like, for example, how many domestic workers are there in the UK? What is the size of the population? Now, we don’t know that number, but we have some belief about it. The beliefs I’ve been using are something like 1.74 million, say 2 million, whatever. So you can change that number, and the resulting estimates are very, very similar—again, in this 30-40% range.

There are other techniques. The techniques I've been using all assume that the graph is connected. What that means is that if we were to know everybody’s social network—which we don’t—but if we were to know all of it, it’s connected. Functionally, what that means is that if there’s an Ecuadorian in our sample, that truly, if we had the entire social network of all domestic workers in the UK—which we don’t—if we did, there’d be some path from that domestic worker from Ecuador to any other person, any other domestic worker in the UK—in particular, to the Filipino worker who might be in our sample or might not, to the British-born, the British national, whatever. So truly, they’re all connected. Now, I think I mentioned this, but there are reasons to think that might not be true, that there really might be clusters or subgroups here, primarily around language, I would guess. Again, I'm not an expert, but... so that’s fine.

There are techniques to deal with that. We could, and I haven’t, but we could pretty straightforwardly deal with, well, maybe there’s a Filipino network, and maybe there’s a Spanish-speaking network, or maybe there’s a UK-born network, and maybe those are different. Maybe they’re not—maybe they’re all connected. But we could... one might say, well, I don’t really think that they’re all connected. So that’s fine—we can deal with that. I haven’t, but we can. Okay, so that’s one thing—disaggregate by origin. We got that. Like I said, it’s, in my opinion, shockingly high. So, you know, there’s the whole, do we believe it?

Oh, and then... right. So then there’s an entirely separate, to my mind, third sort of approach or strata estimation strategy, which is so far everything I've talked about is sort of off-the-shelf RDS. It’s very sophisticated and involves tweaks like visibility and measurement error, yada, yada, yada, yada, but it’s very... our sample is RDS, and we’re trying to estimate the size of some population/hidden population/members of the population with some particular categorical attribute, etc., which again, perfectly fine, fits the data fantastically. It’s not at all what I thought we initially started this project with, which was some variant of in-sum or network scale-up—in particular, your very, very cool and very novel idea to use the generalized GN sum here.

So the question is, can we use the data that we have to do some kind of in-sum-ish estimation? The reason I'm sort of pushing this or advocating for this is because I think it’s much more... my guess is it’s going to be much more powerful because in-sum is using more information. And it’s not just counting the number of... well, how do I say this... so in-sum is very, very powerful. The issue is, if you don’t have a random sample, what do you do about that? The answer is lots of weird math that essentially boils down to the linchpin for us—what’s called inclusion probabilities. We don’t have a random sample, we acknowledge that, that’s fine. So what statistical tricks can we do to the data that we have in-sample so as to be able to justify and use techniques that are meant for analysis of random samples, like in-sum?

So there’s an answer to that, and the answer is weighting. I think there are some really, really nice intersections here, and it’s really pretty straightforward. I haven’t implemented them, but essentially we can derive weights from these RDS estimators and logic and packages in R to come up with these inclusion probabilities. Again, we can do a few robustness whatever, and then use those in the in-sum calculations. I haven’t done that, but I'm really excited to do that because I think... my hunch is that’s going to be much more powerful in that it’s sort of taking the best—it’s squeezing all the information that at least I am aware of—out of the data that we actually have.

Okay, I've been rambling. Combined with that... so I haven’t done that. So, Scott Moser to do: bootstraps—I’ve done some, I haven’t done all of them; sensitivity analysis—again, some, not a bunch; this third way—this in-sum plus RDS weights—I’m very excited about, haven’t touched it, I haven’t touched it practically. I have thought about it and have notes, which are a mess.

Next topic: presentation. What do we want to present? And how do we want to present it? Tables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian plus series, what? I don’t know. And if I'm being perfectly honest with you, Caroline, I'm not really... right now, I'm not in a huge position to sort of produce publication-ready graphics or what have you. But I think that’s a discussion that would help me, at least.

Okay, I think I'm about to get cut off again, so I'm going to stop. This is what I was hoping to report, discuss, talk about with you on Monday. Like I said, I utterly failed. Hopefully, this has some meaning.

Hello, Carolyn. This is Scott. I apologize for missing our Monday meeting. I've been buried in administrative duties on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and then returned to the endless marking. I’ve done some work and wanted to update you, but my typing is poor and my spelling even worse. So I thought it would be quicker to send you a recording. I tried to organize my thoughts somewhat, so here’s where I’m at and what I hoped to discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed that.

To begin, I’ve been reconsidering the conceptualization and population aspects of our study, which I’ll refer to as the setting. The first question is, what is the population? I think we have a clear answer: domestic workers in the UK. More specifically, it’s domestic workers in the UK who have a mobile phone during the survey fielding period, or perhaps those who have had a mobile phone in the calendar year preceding the survey.

If that’s our population, which I believe it is and it’s well-defined, then the target population, or the hidden population, so to speak, would be domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone and have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There are several ways we can operationalize this. You and Salim, with a little input from me, have developed three very principled methods to do so.

The first two are dichotomous variables. The first is Question 36, dichotomized to ask if respondents are paid less than the legal minimum wage. The second is Question 80, also dichotomized, which asks if they have been through the national referral mechanism or been referred to it. To my mind, these are high bars. If someone truthfully answers "yes" to either of these questions, I think we can be confident that they are indeed part of the hidden population. I’m not an expert in this area, but that seems reasonable to me.

We also discussed—and you and Salim mainly developed—a continuous measure. This third idea is conceptually different. You developed a series of indicators, something like eight, twelve, or sixteen, and normalized them to calculate how many of these indicators a person satisfies, possibly with weighting. This results in a number between zero and one, representing the person’s risk of experiencing modern slavery.

If we use that as a continuous measure—not measuring whether someone has experienced modern slavery, but rather their risk of experiencing it—it may seem like splitting hairs, but methodologically and conceptually, these are quite different approaches. If we claim to measure the risk of exposure, then the hidden population needs to be redefined. In this case, the population we’re sampling from would still be domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, but everyone in that population would have some level of risk for experiencing modern slavery, even if that risk is zero. I think this conceptual distinction is important.

So, that’s where I started. We have the population, the target population, and now we need to discuss the sampling. Where is this data coming from? We spent some time on this, and although the conclusion might not be what we wanted, I think it’s productive. We have a convenience sample through a Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) method. This involves sampling domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, starting with initial seeds and then branching out using RDS with five coupons. This isn’t exactly a snowball sampling method but a modified version.

Again, these are my beliefs, so please correct me if I’m wrong. This is the data we have to work with, so the question is, what do we do with it?

One additional aspect to consider about the sample is that it functionally comes from three subgroups within the population: people from the Philippines, Latinx individuals, and British-born individuals. We might say there are three distinct clusters based on nationality, which I think we could assert with some confidence.

Now, moving on to data issues, specifically, do we know anything about the size of the population? I found two sources: one is an official UK site, nationalcareers.service.gov.uk, with job groupings, possibly based on census data, and the other is from an organization called BICS. These provide some estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK, depending on how we define it—whether it includes home cleaning, daycare, institutionalized work, etc. This is just a preliminary exploration.

We could also estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from your RDS sample. One of the survey questions asks how many other domestic workers the respondent knows in the UK. This could help estimate the population size. I’m currently exploring this, but it’s yielding some strange results—like the population estimate being too small and the computation taking too long.

So, regarding analysis, the first step is to take it from the literature—specifically, using the SSPS method by Guile et al. This is the successive sampling population size estimate, which is state-of-the-art. It uses the wave at which a respondent appears in the sample as additional information, which helps mitigate biases present in earlier RDS methods. We can apply this to estimate proportions within the population who are part of the hidden population, based on whether they meet the criteria of modern slavery, as defined by Questions 36 or 80.

One thing I should mention, and much appreciation to Salim for his work, is the issue of handling “don’t know” responses. Currently, these are coded as negative responses, but an alternative is to treat them as missing data, which could slightly increase the estimated proportion of domestic workers experiencing modern slavery.

There’s also the issue of respondents who report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK but then provide referrals, which is a logical inconsistency. We may need to adjust these zeros to something positive, possibly by adding one to everyone’s reported degree, although this approach isn’t principled.

Regarding results, the preliminary estimates suggest that 30-40% of domestic workers in the UK are experiencing modern slavery, which seems high but is consistent with the data. We can run sensitivity analyses and explore further robustness checks.

In terms of presentation, I’m not in a position to produce publication-ready graphics at the moment, but I’d appreciate discussing how we want to present these findings—whether through tables, graphs, confidence intervals, etc.

This is what I hoped to report and discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed the meeting, but I hope this recording conveys the key points. I’ll try to send along a summary transcript as well.

### Improved Full Response

Here’s a more detailed and focused version of the response:

* * *

Hello, Carolyn. This is Scott. I apologize for missing our Monday meeting. I've been buried in administrative duties on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and then returned to the endless marking. I’ve done some work and wanted to update you, but my typing is poor and my spelling even worse. So I thought it would be quicker to send you a recording. I tried to organize my thoughts somewhat, so here’s where I’m at and what I hoped to discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed that.

To begin, I’ve been reconsidering the conceptualization and population aspects of our study, which I’ll refer to as the setting. The first question is, what is the population? I think we have a clear answer: domestic workers in the UK. More specifically, it’s domestic workers in the UK who have a mobile phone during the survey fielding period, or perhaps those who have had a mobile phone in the calendar year preceding the survey.

If that’s our population, which I believe it is and it’s well-defined, then the target population, or the hidden population, so to speak, would be domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone and have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There are several ways we can operationalize this. You and Salim, with a little input from me, have developed three very principled methods to do so.

The first two are dichotomous variables. The first is Question 36, dichotomized to ask if respondents are paid less than the legal minimum wage. The second is Question 80, also dichotomized, which asks if they have been through the national referral mechanism or been referred to it. To my mind, these are high bars. If someone truthfully answers "yes" to either of these questions, I think we can be confident that they are indeed part of the hidden population. I’m not an expert in this area, but that seems reasonable to me.

We also discussed—and you and Salim mainly developed—a continuous measure. This third idea is conceptually different. You developed a series of indicators, something like eight, twelve, or sixteen, and normalized them to calculate how many of these indicators a person satisfies, possibly with weighting. This results in a number between zero and one, representing the person’s risk of experiencing modern slavery.

For example, suppose an individual meets five out of twelve indicators, and those indicators have varying weights based on their severity. In that case, the final risk score might be 0.4 or 0.6, reflecting their relative risk compared to others in the population. If we use that as a continuous measure—not measuring whether someone has experienced modern slavery, but rather their risk of experiencing it—it may seem like splitting hairs, but methodologically and conceptually, these are quite different approaches. If we claim to measure the risk of exposure, then the hidden population needs to be redefined. In this case, the population we’re sampling from would still be domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, but everyone in that population would have some level of risk for experiencing modern slavery, even if that risk is zero. I think this conceptual distinction is important.

So, that’s where I started. We have the population, the target population, and now we need to discuss the sampling. Where is this data coming from? We spent some time on this, and although the conclusion might not be what we wanted, I think it’s productive. We have a convenience sample through a Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) method. This involves sampling domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, starting with initial seeds and then branching out using RDS with five coupons. This isn’t exactly a snowball sampling method but a modified version.

For instance, let’s say we start with a group of domestic workers who have been identified through NGOs. They serve as the initial seeds, each given five coupons to recruit others. As this process continues, we accumulate a networked sample representing the broader population of domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones.

Again, these are my beliefs, so please correct me if I’m wrong. This is the data we have to work with, so the question is, what do we do with it?

One additional aspect to consider about the sample is that it functionally comes from three subgroups within the population: people from the Philippines, Latinx individuals, and British-born individuals. We might say there are three distinct clusters based on nationality, which I think we could assert with some confidence. For example, if 40% of our sample is Filipina, 30% Latinx, and 30% British-born, these clusters could be analyzed separately to identify differences in their risk levels or experiences of modern slavery.

Now, moving on to data issues, specifically, do we know anything about the size of the population? I found two sources: one is an official UK site, nationalcareers.service.gov.uk, with job groupings, possibly based on census data, and the other is from an organization called BICS. These provide some estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK, depending on how we define it—whether it includes home cleaning, daycare, institutionalized work, etc. This is just a preliminary exploration.

We could also estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from your RDS sample. One of the survey questions asks how many other domestic workers the respondent knows in the UK. For example, if the average respondent knows 10 other domestic workers, and we have 100 respondents, this could give us a rough estimate of the total population size. However, I’m currently exploring this, but it’s yielding some strange results—like the population estimate being too small and the computation taking too long.

So, regarding analysis, the first step is to take it from the literature—specifically, using the SSPS method by Guile et al. This is the successive sampling population size estimate, which is state-of-the-art. It uses the wave at which a respondent appears in the sample as additional information, which helps mitigate biases present in earlier RDS methods. For example, if a respondent with a large social network joins in the third wave, this information helps adjust the overall population estimates, considering the size of their network and when they were recruited. We can apply this to estimate proportions within the population who are part of the hidden population, based on whether they meet the criteria of modern slavery, as defined by Questions 36 or 80.

One thing I should mention, and much appreciation to Salim for his work, is the issue of handling “don’t know” responses. For example, if a respondent answers “I don’t know” to whether they’ve been referred to the national referral mechanism, the current approach is to code this as a negative response. However, an alternative is to treat these as missing data, which could slightly increase the estimated proportion of domestic workers experiencing modern slavery. Specifically, if we treat “don’t know” responses as missing and exclude them from the analysis, the overall proportion might increase from, say, 35% to 38%, due to the exclusion of ambiguous responses.

There’s also the issue of respondents who report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK but then provide referrals, which is a logical inconsistency. For example, if someone claims to know zero domestic workers but then provides contact information for two others, this inconsistency needs to be addressed. We may need to adjust these zeros to something positive, possibly by adding one to everyone’s reported degree, although this approach isn’t principled.

Regarding results, the preliminary estimates suggest that 30-40% of domestic workers in the UK are experiencing modern slavery, which seems high but is consistent with the data. We can run sensitivity analyses and explore further robustness checks. For example, we might compare the results using different prior assumptions about the population size or alternative methods for handling missing data.

In terms of presentation, I’m not in a position to produce publication-ready graphics at the moment, but I’d appreciate discussing how we want to present these findings—whether through tables, graphs, confidence intervals, etc. For instance, we could include a table summarizing the risk scores across different subgroups, a graph showing the distribution of risk scores, and confidence intervals for the estimated proportions of the hidden population.


This is what I hoped to report and discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed the meeting, but I hope this recording conveys the key points. I’ll try to send along a summary transcript as well.

### Further Considerations and Next Steps

**Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis**:

* We should consider conducting a robustness analysis to ensure that our results hold under different assumptions. For example, we could vary the assumptions about the size of the hidden population or test the sensitivity of our estimates to different methods of handling missing data or "don’t know" responses.
* Additionally, it might be valuable to explore alternative models or techniques, such as Bayesian hierarchical models, which could provide more nuanced insights into the variability of risk across different subgroups.

**Use of Network Data**:

* Since our study heavily relies on Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), it’s essential to maximize the information we extract from the network data. Specifically, we should explore methods that leverage the connections within the network to improve our population estimates. For example, we could use network imputation techniques to fill in missing connections or apply advanced RDS estimators that account for network structure.
* There’s also the potential to use network visualization tools to map out the connections between respondents and highlight key influencers or hubs within the network. These visualizations could be powerful tools for both analysis and presentation.

**Presentation and Reporting**:

* For the final report or publication, I suggest including the following:
    * **Tables**: Summarize key demographic characteristics of the sample, the distribution of risk scores, and the estimated proportions of the hidden population by subgroup (e.g., Filipino, Latinx, British-born).
    * **Figures**: Include graphs that display the distribution of risk scores, the convergence of the SSPS estimates, and network diagrams that illustrate the structure of the respondent-driven sample.
    * **Appendices**: Provide detailed methodological appendices that explain the statistical techniques used, the handling of missing data, and any robustness checks performed.

**Collaboration and Next Steps**:

* I’m excited to continue working on this project and am eager to explore the additional analyses we’ve discussed. I’ll continue refining the estimates and will also begin drafting sections of the manuscript where appropriate.
* I’d also appreciate any feedback you have on the current direction, particularly regarding the handling of the “don’t know” responses and the logical inconsistencies we’ve identified. If you have suggestions for alternative approaches or additional analyses that you think might be valuable, please let me know.

### Conclusion

To wrap up, we’re making good progress, and the preliminary results are both intriguing and important. I believe that by addressing the remaining data issues and refining our analysis, we can produce a robust and impactful study that sheds light on the experiences of domestic workers in the UK, particularly those at risk of modern slavery. I look forward to our continued collaboration and to discussing these findings further with you.

Thanks again for your patience, and I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
Scott

Dear Carolyn, thank you so much for your email, it was lovely to get it, yes I'd be happy
to talk, teaching this term is going to be very very bad for me, but I would love to
get back in touch and talk about research, oh by the way I had a meeting with Zoe and
Nick and Todd at the rights lab regarding grants and your in Salim's paper was of much
interest and fanfare, so kudos.
I'm writing to, so I'm not trying to prioritize, so I'm writing this grant on comparing different
methods of prevalence estimation and I'm thrilled that you're willing to be involved.
I'll send the draft of the Nuffield application, but we've costed you for 10% of your time
over two years I think, and I think it's just a really neat, I'm looking forward to working
with you again and I think the way I'm imagining one way that the grant could go I think would
just sort of very naturally pick up where you and me and Salim a little bit kind of
left off with your domestic worker RDS stuff.
Now I do have some questions, so just for generally very briefly the main idea behind
the grant is to, Zoe calls it a feasibility study, so go to Birmingham, sample some local
authorities and ask people a bunch of questions, and so in some people if you happen to find
a member of the hidden population, you can link trace them or what have you, and do
come in all these different methods and then we're going to compare them and okay fine.
But there's a few issues here, so in your study it was very, very well operationalized
what domestic workers experiencing modern slavery meant, and you had these different
indicators and that's fantastic.
But it seems a bit weird, it seems like the insum approach that what I'm trying to say
and I'm not doing a very good job is what hidden population should I slash we use.
I had thought domestic servitude or domestic workers would be a good place to start mainly
because of you and your work and I know you and that's great, but now I'm wondering if
that's sort of the open quote right, close quote hidden population to start with simply
because members of this hidden population might not know that they're members of it,
but I think that's one reason why your, the questions on your survey were really good
because we the researchers can use their answers to these questions and say actually you are
being exploited or what not.
So I guess that's one question is sort of what's the, is that a problem that individuals
might not know that they're members of a hidden population.
Also if we're insuming these people, people who are answering, I think the question kind
of compounds because the question is something like how many domestic workers do you know
that are being exploited or that are being, that are experiencing the domestic workers.
So one thing you could do is just say, well, the thing is we, you and I did this and in
your work us say, well look, it's a sliding scale, all domestic workers have some risk
exposure to exploitation and so we're not going to ask dear sir or madam, how many domestic
workers do you know that are being exploited, we'll just ask how many domestic workers
do you know and then use that as the basis for the, for the insum estimates.
If we wanted to be great to, to try out the G insum, but to do that we would need to then
go find those people and ask them a battery of questions.
Yeah, they don't know.




Dear Caroline,
I hope you are enjoying your time off and getting some well-deserved rest. Thank you for your kind note, and there’s absolutely no need to apologize for the delay—it's completely understandable given the end-of-term rush.
I agree that a meeting to revisit and park the project is a good idea. I’m aware that we’ll both be balancing quite a few tasks, but perhaps we could aim to meet in mid-October when I’m more settled into my teaching schedule, and you’ve had a chance to catch up. I believe this will give us the chance to ensure we're aligned and make sure the paper comes together as planned.
In the meantime, I wanted to update you on my ongoing work for the Nuffield Foundation grant. As you’ll see in the attached project outline and draft application, the focus is on comparing different methods for estimating the prevalence of hidden populations. Zoe and Karen at the RL put your time on the project at 10% over the two years, which I hope is agreeable. I'm excited about the potential of this project and how it intersects with our work on domestic workers and modern slavery.
In a recent meeting with Zoe, Nick, and Todd at the Rights Lab, there was strong support for the direction of our research, particularly regarding your contributions and Selim’s. I think the Nuffield grant offers an excellent opportunity to build on this momentum.
I do, however, have some questions about refining the focus population for the grant. Initially, I had considered centering the project around domestic workers, given your expertise. But I’ve been reflecting on whether domestic servitude is the best fit for this type of estimation study. One challenge I foresee is that individuals in this hidden population may not always self-identify as part of it. Your work in operationalizing indicators of exploitation through indirect questioning in the survey was excellent, and I’m wondering if we need to employ a similar approach here.
Specifically, I’m thinking about the phrasing of questions when using methods like the Generalized Network Scale-Up (G-NSUM). Instead of asking respondents directly about how many exploited domestic workers they know, perhaps we should use broader phrasing—such as “How many domestic workers do you know?”—to avoid relying on respondents recognizing exploitation themselves. This could provide us with a clearer picture without placing undue pressure on respondents to identify exploitation directly.
I would love to hear your thoughts on these points, especially regarding whether domestic workers remain the most suitable hidden population for this study and how we might refine our methodology.
Looking forward to catching up when you’re back, and thank you again for your continued support on this project.  I’m really looking forward to working with you again!!!
Best wishes,
Scott
