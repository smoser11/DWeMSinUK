1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm late, I'm trying to do too much today and I'm just doing some admin.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, maybe I might have overreacted a little bit.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The weekend was productive but I'm still stuck.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's three things and the biggest is the question.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have three indicators at the individual level of you experience exploitation.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's this Q36, 80, and this very cool category index that you and Selim cooked up.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's great.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can use those variables to estimate prevalence of exploitation based on survey response,

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
based on individuals working in domestic labor in the UK in the last year.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's these RDS methods, which we can do.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's great.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That technique, that class of estimation, basically the whole trick is they're taking the sample as the sample

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and then the difficulties that RDS tries to fix up is the non-random sampling.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It does it in several really creative ways and super-duper and we can do all that.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Awesome.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Great.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then I turn to insum.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The strategy behind insum is much different.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The information that insum uses isn't have you experienced exploitation.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's how many people do you know that have experienced exploitation?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In that setting, what's really important is the number of people respondents know.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not very important if a respondent is in the hidden population or not, has experienced

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
exploitation or not, but it's important.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The two things are how many people do you know, period, and that turns out that's hard to estimate,

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but there's ways.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The one that I like is called the known population method.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then two, how many people do you know in the hidden population?

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A few things.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
First, thank you very much for making the time to talk with me.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I appreciate it.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry for being a little bit spastic.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think both of our work weeks are turning hellish.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Anyway, I appreciate it.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A few issues here.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
One is, can we measure the same notion of exploitation using these two methods?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm afraid, on Friday, my answer was no.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't think we can because of the questions that are asked.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The first type asks questions about, and there's only this morning that I had the clarity.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There's different types of questions in the survey, but for this discussion, there's two

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
relevant types.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
One is about your own experience at work, and the other is people you know.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What we need is some overlap.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We need there to be something that some, well, let me put it differently.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If we want to use the two methods in the same paper and say that we're studying exploitation

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
in a consistent way, then we need some sort of overlap.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm having trouble finding that.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The only one I've found so far is NRM, natural referral mechanisms.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We know if a member has been referred, if a respondent's been referred, and we know how

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
many they know in that population.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now, things get even weirder.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
One, hopefully there's more overlap because if that's the only one, that's a very, very

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
clean measure of exploitation.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We certainly, it's a high bar.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You've picked it as one of the endpoints on the individual level, and I think all that's

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
great, but then things get even weirder.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
One, I hope that there's more overlap than just that.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For a number of reasons.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
One, it's a very, very high bar.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Two, we're sort of using that group to do, it's wearing lots of hats because we're using

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
it as the known population method, but then it's just pretty weird because we're saying

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
like, okay, we're going to use this group to estimate individuals' degrees, the networks,

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
how many people they know, but then we're also going to use it to try to estimate the

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
hidden population.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wait a second.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It can't be both, right?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I mean, if we know, so what I'm trying to say is like, it gets back to this notion of

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
like, what are we measuring?

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What notion of exploitation is being estimated in the insum?

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And that becomes especially problematic if the only overlap we have, hopefully it makes

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
sense when I say overlap, is the number of referrals.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I very well could be wrong, and just this morning I pulled out, I think I identified

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
questions of the first type and questions of the second type, and I haven't compared them,

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but hopefully I'm wrong and there is more overlap.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But wait, it gets even weirder because it's kind of cool.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If we can get both of these methods to work in the same paper, it's actually pretty methodologically

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
cool because the, so in the first method, the RDS methods, you're looking for people in this

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
hidden population, right?

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're trying to identify them, and then you're doing some correction because of non-random

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
sampling.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And that's where the degree, that's where the social network comes in, is that it's just

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
used for this kind of selection waiting issue.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And again, I'm way glossing over people, really smart people who work on this.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And in the insum method, it's really kind of intuitive.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's the exact opposite.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You actually don't want members of the hidden population.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You want people who know members of the hidden population.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So for kind of technical reasons, it turns out you need to exclude if you found someone

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in the hidden population using the, using the particular type of insum that I've instantiated,

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and there are others that we could use that don't suffer from this problem.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But if we use the one, the modified one from the Fihann and Solnick, then you actually need

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to exclude members from the hidden population when doing your calculations in the insum method.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And the reason is because basically you just want, you want, you need to know the size

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
of the frame minus the size of the hidden population.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's just kind of, it's annoying if you ask me, but fine.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay, so here's where the hard part comes in.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We have these different ways of indicating if you're in the hidden population.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I'll just take the two.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So this is a Q80 and Q36.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So get this.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, so we're up to speed.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're doing insum where we need to exclude members from the hidden population and then

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we need to know how many people in the sample, sorry, how many people in the hidden population

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
are known to an individual respondent.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, I'm going to first cup of coffee.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So depending on how we define members of the hidden population, like Q80 or Q36,

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
we run into estimation problems in that.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So for example, so here's the details.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So say we use the high bar.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So say we say, okay, we have a sample of individuals.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're going to say an individual, an individual in our sample is being exploited.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If they say yes to the NRM, if they've been personally individually referred.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, so fine.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So that means we need to find all those people and take them out and then do our.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So if we use that method, then who's left?

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
None of them know anyone in the hidden population.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Zero is all around.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So it just won't work.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It just won't work.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So if we use a Q36, then that's it.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And that sort of gave me pause because what that means is no one who hasn't been referred

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is anyone who has been referred, which I mean, it's not implausible.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And especially given the small numbers, it's, it's, it's even more not implausible.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's even less, it's even more plausible, I guess.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But it's weird.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you see what I mean?

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's basically perfect separation.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you've been referred to the natural referral mechanism, then you might know other people that have.

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And if you haven't, you don't know anybody who has.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so as a result, we can't, we can't use that notion or things.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Matthews breaks down.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If we use Q80 as our notion of being in the hidden population and we do this removal business and we do in some things break.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So we'd have to use other notions of, which is Z36, which is fine.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We can do that.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And that, that, that works.

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And that goes through.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Excuse me.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sorry.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to get way too excited about this stuff.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No, that's okay.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So just so I can reflect on what you're telling me.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So to conduct a sensible new some, you need to have members of one of these bars who know other members who experiencing this, but are not themselves experiencing exploitation.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not sure I've got that.

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's exactly right.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And for question 80, that doesn't apply.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So we don't, we get a sample of zero effectively.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Exactly.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But for question 36, there are some people who aren't experiencing low level exploitation, but do know other people who are.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So they can be used to do the new some.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is that what you're saying?

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Exactly right.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Exactly right.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Exactly right.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then go ahead.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All this gets fixed if we can find more overlap in these in the question.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And like I say, I haven't.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Not only this morning, I sort of tried to identify, I think, and thanks to you, you have that document that is a great start of individual indicators of individual exploitation.

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So that's like, you know, so that's basically what we're trying to do this morning is create one of those, but for the people, you know, questions.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And then we'll have to see if there's overlap and hopefully there is.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because if not, we run into all these weird things that I hopefully I have not clearly articulated.

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But some of the weird things are technical, like we can't use Q80.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Some of them are more conceptual, like if we're using number of referrals as both the known, if we're using that to both estimate individual degree sizes and in some, but then we're also using it as.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
As the hidden population, then it just things just get really, I mean, just at a conceptual level, it just sort of breaks down.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like what do you mean, like either you know the size or you don't.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I guess I mean, there's ways around that, like we could say, well, hang on, in some is open to more than just domestic workers.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So, you know, we could, there's sort of conceptual tricks, I think we can play to sort of get out of that.

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But it just, it just gets, it doesn't not really, not really.

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But, but you know, things, I mean, at a technical level, I can get things to work.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then sort of good news and then a little bit of bad news, but with a thought that I don't know how clever it is, but I was light bulb popped on.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So the good news, so the yes, so I get, I get estimates.

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And they're very consistent with at least sort of what I understand to be received wisdom.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So like from the, the, the West Midlands police stuff.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And of course, I'd be method has drawbacks and what.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So the number that I think that I hear getting kicked around is like 100,000, very, very rough, you know, but, but something like that.

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I'm getting, I think a conservative would be 120,000.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And so that's, and it's, and that's sort of, you know, and that's, I find that believable.

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And, and the estimates now.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So the bad news, unlike in the RDS, which had was pretty robust to like all these dials that you could tweak, not, not so in, in some.

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So what really matters is, is the size of an individual's degree now or so the social network information.

183
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And I was thinking about it, I was wondering, like, so why is that really important?

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So, so functioning, what that means is that if we change the, so if we use domestic workers in the UK as the known population, and if we say, okay, we're claiming that we know that there are 980,000 such workers.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Great, that's a number we can use it.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Chug, chug, chug, we get answers.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you say, well, no, actually there's only 50,000.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Chug, chug, chug, you get way different numbers.

189
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I was thinking, like, why is it, why are they so different in these two methods?

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because it's the exact opposite over here with the, I hope this makes sense.

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In the RDS one.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it dawned on me, I was rather pleased with this.

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So, I mean, there's something interesting methodologically going on here.

194
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And the reason is, is because the degree network is playing at much different roles in the two estimation methods.

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So in the RDS, it's just being used just to, to fix up the sampling weights, to fix up the non-randomness.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But in, but in, in some, the degree, the size of an individual's degree network is, is, is what, is what the scaling up is based on.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So it's, it's really important to get that, to get that right.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I think that's sort of an interesting and unfortunate for us, not the logical.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So what that means is that we really need to pin down these numbers.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So just to give you an idea, so if I do the same sort of, you know, and by the way, I'm talking several orders of magnitude here.

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Say there's only 10,000 people in, in domestic work.

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Say there's 100,000.

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Say there's a million, you know, I mean, so there's a way different numbers.

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But the estimates using in some range from mid teens, 16,000 to 160,000, depending on basically the size of the known, of the known groups.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So I'm sorry for rambling at you, but those are the most important thing.

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And the thing that, that is, well, I don't know if it's the most important thing, but the thing that would help us tremendously is this overlap issue is, is, is there a question?

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is there a way of, of implementing a notion of exploitation that for which we have good questions, both at the individual, are you experiencing notion X of exploitation?

208
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And how many people do you know are experiencing notion X of exploitation?

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So we've got some, some possible candidates for those based on the risk index.

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But yeah, that would obviously take a bit of work to go through each one and see whether or not any of those hold up.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, I can show you if you've got time, I can share screen to show you the what the, so like I said, I was just sort of, oh, no, no.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I got one question.

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Sure.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Please.

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Sorry.

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
With question 80, we had a defined population of those people who had the, we knew the population for the NRM community.

217
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Does that mean if we use question 36 that we need to have a population estimate for those people who have not received the national minimum wage?

218
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
For the comparability to work, yes.

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Because we don't have that yet, do we?

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No, no, I don't think so.

221
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But there's other individual questions, like the ones on your risk index, right?

222
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And, and, and, you know, I've only, let me try to share screen.

224
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I've only just sit this morning.

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think I found 15 questions that it's kind of, for me, it was fortunate because in the code book, they all say things like, if so, how many, like there's easy,

226
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry, give me a second to, where did this thing go?

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Here it is.

228
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Hopefully you can see, I guess it's kind of ugly.

229
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Sorry about that.

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Let me see if I can make it prettier.

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Probably not.

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And everything just disappeared.

233
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Lovely.

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I suppose your question, your discussion about the difference in the sensitivity analysis.

235
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Worst case, we could just indicate that fact.

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Exactly.

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The two different methods result in very different sensitivities.

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

239
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's right.

240
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I mean, to think, you know, the thing, I think we've always sort of just, you know, triangulating, I think, you know, I think they're personally,

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think you and I are in the same page with us.

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think we awesome to include, to write a paper that uses both of these techniques would be, I think we really strong.

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They are getting sort of qualitatively slightly different.

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So if we use the RDS, the estimates are, you know, something like 30 to 40%, which if we think there's about a million, you know, that gives about twice, at least twice as many domestic workers experience

245
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
exploitation using the RDS methods as opposed to 300 to 400,000 compared to 120 to 160,000.

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So, you know, those are pretty big differences, but they're the same order of magnitude.

247
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And currently we don't really have, currently that's not really a fair comparison because the notion of exploitation is different using in the two methods.

248
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We have the Q30 Q80 over here and I guess we have the QQ80 over there too.

249
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Here's what I found, here's what I've identified as, yeah, so what, there's 15, yeah, as sort of, I don't know what I call them group questions.

250
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So, you know, 13 for sure we've used dissatisfied, you know, do not have good relations, you know, these aren't really, you see what I'm saying, right?

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah.

252
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And now there are some, so there's some that are sort of exactly spot on, like, so threat of force, I believe, is asked to both.

253
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's a good one, yeah.

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So that, that's a good one.

255
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And there's one that was just, so, yeah.

256
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So I guess to take, if you do not know where to, yeah, so there's, whoops, 33, so severe forms of labor exploitation without using NRM, we, you know, odd one.

257
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I thought there was one that was in order to help suffer bad environmental conditions, access to medical care.

258
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Maybe travel documents.

259
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Maybe.

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, that's another good one.

261
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
A threat of force.

262
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So it's called slavery.

263
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, right.

264
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So I guess, I guess the takeaway is, you know, like bad working conditions that doesn't sound to me.

265
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I defer to you, but it's like, I don't know.

266
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Restrictions on freedom.

267
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know if we have that at the individual level, but that's a possibility, I think.

268
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay, I'm going to stop sharing with you.

269
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So that's sort of hot off the presses.

270
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oops, sorry, let me, but not everything.

271
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Not everything.

272
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And I guess sort of the, as I'm hearing myself talk, I guess one of the takeaways is, I'm so sorry about this, but given what we're finding when attempting to use the in some estimation technique, we might need to go back.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's looking like we need to go back and rethink and redo the RDS analysis with.

274
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, I see what you're saying, because we haven't got that comparator that strong comparator that with question 80 it just doesn't exist in this method.

275
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So, yeah.

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So it's worth.

277
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I suppose, from what you're saying it sounds like it's worth redoing it because this comparison is quite interesting methodologically.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Also, I think we can say something about the nature of estimation using these two different techniques, even if our data doesn't enable us to.

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, our data says this is complicated and we can probably make some methodological recommendations for other people researching in this area.

280
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's a great silver lining, Caroline.

281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, no, that's right.

282
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So right.

283
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So what have we learned, right?

284
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like going forward, how would you.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What would we do differently?

286
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What would we advise people to, I mean, because this hasn't been tied before, I don't think.

287
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So this is, I mean, this is if we were doing it was starting and we wouldn't do it like this week, we do something different so we can say what we would do differently.

288
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's a really good idea.

289
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's a really good idea.

290
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, no, I think that's that's an excellent, that's an excellent idea.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I think sort of most immediately and sadly, most immediately is going to be at least two weeks for me because of teaching, but the overlap issue.

292
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like if we can find those questions that that would that would I think that's sort of the next step, I think.

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

294
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But what do you say after hearing me ramble for what do you think what should we do next?

295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Sorry.

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

297
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So I'm wondering those questions that we indicated on the risk indices are those the ones that you've pulled out that you're looking at in more detail now or these are the specific and some questions that asked about the difference in the population in population.

298
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Sorry.

299
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Sorry.

300
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Asked about the number of people that you knew the second this is a slightly different list.

301
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Exactly.

302
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And we have your list with individual educators we have what I think is my list with the how many people do you know. And so now we just need to see what the overlap is.

303
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I meant to email it to you right right as soon as I can.

304
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And that would be looking for strong and some questions really.

305
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We're looking we're looking for indicators of exploitation that are asked about the individual and about people the individual respondent knows.

306
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I didn't really fully appreciate that those were, I just kind of figured and that's my my apologies I was an assumption on my part that there was kind of a like a symmetry there that like that those questions were the same which they are and that's fine.

307
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay.

309
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But but I mean it's not it's not all gloom and doom I mean I think you know I did.

310
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Worst case scenario I think we're going to have to re operationalize.

311
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Exploitation.

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So, you know, verbally abused, maybe, or threat force, you know, threat of force or something like that, or not access to travel, whatever I don't know.

313
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I think worst case scenario we're going to have to.

314
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, again, all this is if we want to use these two methods in the same paper and and claim that we're estimating, you know, some something called exploitation in a coherent manner, which I think we do I think we all want that I think that's kind of the goal of the paper so.

315
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So, yeah.

316
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Does that make sense I'm so sorry for rambling at your Caroline.

317
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So it does make sense.

318
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm just trying to work out which is the best way forward.

319
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:26,000
For me, I think it's the fact more time it would be that they would be looking at the questions with comparing the the individual indicators to the how many people do you know that.

320
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's up for you know that have trade X, where trade X could be bad working environment, no access to your travel documents, been verbally harassed at work, etc, etc.

321
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Or could be have been referred to the National Referral Mechanism is also a perfectly fine indicator.

322
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Right now it's the only that's the only one that I'm that I know of and for all the reasons we've talked about it's somewhat problematic.

323
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's a bit weird at the at the moment, like I said if we can find more and it's overlapped and things get things get better.

324
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Alternatively, or I guess concurrently if we had more known group sizes that would help.

325
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So if we knew the number of well domestic workers obviously but if we knew the well like you said so if we knew the number of domestic workers getting paid below the minimum wage that would that would be a big help.

326
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Of course, we don't and we likely can't know that number.

327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't think we can find it.

328
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
No, I don't think so either.

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't think we can estimate it even.

330
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
No.

331
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Very convincingly.

332
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So that's sort of I don't see how we go down that track any further.

333
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, I agree.

334
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And you know more about this than I do so.

335
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So I guess to end on some on some slightly positive news is the.

336
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So I was rereading the Feehan and Solnick and they you know they have been modified the estimate that you picked and you're right is a great one.

337
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And they get these recommendations that's what we're using.

338
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And then the next line the next equation is they say well you know what would be even better is if you know they have these adjustment factors that they and so they say well even better as if you could you know you sort of include these adjustment factors and then just be upfront about what

339
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:21,000
values you're choosing and I always thought that was kind of a dead end because we just you know you just don't because of the weird game of contacts like we just visibility basically is what is what we don't have that.

340
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But I was thinking you know it's very ad hoc but they're weirdly using so the main things there are transmission error and homophily.

341
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Which I don't remember what that what that is and weirdly you you get estimates for those from RDS methods.

342
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So it's very ad hoc and there's no statistical principle underlying it but we could.

343
00:26:44,000 --> 00:27:00,000
There are principle values that we could use in and again just be very upfront and say you know here's the range and here's the sensitivity but from these other estimation techniques we have a pretty good belief that the homophily level is 8.1.

344
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So we can plug that in which again I haven't seen done anywhere and maybe because it's a bad idea but it's it's also kind of cool because of this.

345
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like you said like it's people don't I was shocked to when I started when we way back when I was.

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah I don't think anyone's written on as far as I can tell this is this is not people don't do the two at once and and so I think that's very cool if we can get to work.

347
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But I think that the fact that people don't this idea of the sort of isolated community of people in the nrm who don't know other people.

348
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That's quite an interesting finding in itself.

349
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

350
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah.

351
00:27:41,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So if we do know more than reveal that and sort of stop at that point and say we weren't able to pursue the new some estimation further because this was an isolated community that's an interesting finding.

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And also we could then make recommendations about future studies that did want to combine these methods and say these these are the things that would need to be considered in survey design going forward.

353
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I agree.

354
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And another not to be too rare and well to be random I guess the.

355
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So I mean there's there's kind of a positive power.

356
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know if it's positive or maybe depending on political scientists I'm always sort of thinking like policy homework not always but you use ideas but so if the nrm has seventy four thousand or referrals and that and again nrm is bigger than just domestic workers.

357
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But if we take that as as given.

358
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And if we believe that let's say I think one in my opinion one twenty is a conservative estimate 120,000 from them so far again very very preliminary.

359
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And that tells you something about the effectiveness of the nrm.

360
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You know, again, you have to adjust for the fact that nrm is everybody so it's domestic workers plus everybody else and our estimates is just domestic workers but.

361
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I mean I think that would you could say something about like okay well we have now at least we have a way of thinking about how effective is the nrm.

362
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Again in a very sort of.

363
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:33,000
With lots of caveats and but I mean so if you if you had a guess at the proportion of everyone experiencing exploitation in the UK you had if you had an idea of what fraction of that set is occupied by domestic workers.

364
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Then hot dog you could say a bunch about about basically the capture of nrm.

365
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't know if we have principled estimates of that quantity of that proportion but but you get the idea right I mean even if you could sort of say something loosely.

366
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I hadn't thought about that but that's also kind of a nice like.

367
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah things things aren't as gloom and doom as I thought they were on Friday so so one sorry for that and two thank you and your harm's around me think look at it right.

368
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Worst case scenario we write up what we have when we say and here's what we would do differently and you know please learn from our experience and for future research.

369
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Anyway that's the update that's where I was at I was hoping that you had sort of a oh you're the other questions but.

370
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:32,000
No I'm afraid I can't but I can go through the end some questions and identify which are the strongest ones from a exploitation point of view.

371
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Probably try and do that tomorrow that'd be very helpful and send that across to you.

372
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Thank you that would be great.

373
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They are I mean I agree with the ones you put pulled out about coercion and retaining travel documents those are the ones that have the closest link to exploitation so if we find a number of those that have this satisfactory overlap.

374
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Big help big help.

375
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I mean could we say that we are demonstrating how the technique could be used.

376
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You're very good at this.

377
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I like I come with you in bad news you're like no no no no here's here's here's the reframe you just say I like that a lot I like that a lot you're very good at this.

378
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Sorry I'm sorry.

379
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm a mess but I'm given that our data is imperfect but that we but that it we are proving that this can be used if you can and there are improvements that you can make to the data collection.

380
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I think that's exactly right I mean it could be not something to say like a proof of concept but maybe more like you know the people haven't maybe more methodological than we thought people haven't combined these two.

381
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And there's lots of reasons why like way different sampling design assumptions but here's an attempt maybe it's wacky maybe it's maybe it's not.

382
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:03,000
There's some there's some possible benefits or at least some discussion about the role of the social network in the two that wax philosophic about.

383
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yes and and then say well so we tried it and here's what happened and here's here's what you would do going further.

384
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I mean I do think it's it's a powerful.

385
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's I mean this is me waxing philosophic but it's.

386
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It just feels and this is really imprecise but it just feels like a more efficient way to use information and surveys because in this.

387
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The combining.

388
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Because in the one hand like if you.

389
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because if you happen to find somebody in a hidden population then you definitely want their network and you definitely want their referrals.

390
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay but and RDS does that but but RDS sort of.

391
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It doesn't fully use the if.

392
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm doing really bad.

393
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Here's what I'm trying to say.

394
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
In RDS methods then that's the personal networks of those in the hidden population and those not in the hidden population is it doesn't matter.

395
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:21,000
That information isn't taken into account and that feels weird to me because in some is a great way of taking advantage of the of the difference in those in those networks so that's what I mean when I say it feels like sort of.

396
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Information it feels like one of the benefits of combining them if we can is that we're sort of.

397
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Using information we're using more information that's in the survey already that people aren't using currently at least this is the best of my knowledge.

398
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I've had too much coffee you can tell because I am just rambling at you I really like science I really like working with you Caroline so thank you for much for letting me.

399
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well we I think it's fantastic what you're doing so we just need well what's practical to do with the data and I know we wouldn't start from here if we were starting again but this is where we are.

400
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's yeah I think I'm hoping that with your help we can make a contribution from this absolutely no I think so I'll have a look at the questions tomorrow and do my best to pick out what I feel are the strongest ones.

401
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And let you have that and if somehow you can capture what has been useful from the discussion today and yeah.

402
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'll do my best that way for how I might write it up.

403
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Sounds great sounds great and it's it's it's yeah so sorry.

404
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Sorry if I overreacted on Friday it's definitely not there's definitely a way forward so anyway thanks for thanks for this thanks for the timeliness I'll email you.

405
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah it'd be great to get your your take on the the the how many people do you know questions and we'll go forward when we when our teaching schedules permit.

406
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes yeah I'm sorry I've got a really horrible two weeks.

407
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah likewise likewise yeah I can get you the questions tomorrow and then yeah.

408
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
If it if if this way till April so be it.

409
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I mean you know yeah you can do what you can do so.

410
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's just the stop start I know when you're trying it's difficult to keep in your head I know because I've read the Felix and Salmanic paper a couple of times so you just have to start again and reread it to remind yourself what is what they say.

411
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But yeah I agree.

412
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah unfortunately okay well good to catch up with you Scott.

413
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah you as well and again thank you so much for your your your flexibility really really appreciate the meeting I'll set short short short short short notice so good luck with teaching Caroline and yeah we'll be in touch.

414
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah okay thank you.

415
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Thank you.
