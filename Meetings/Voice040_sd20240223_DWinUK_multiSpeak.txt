Speaker 3 

Yeah, all good. Thank you. Just this lovely and the question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns. 

Speaker 2 

Good. How are you? Good. Yeah, it just never ends. It just it's just. Yeah, yeah. Anyway. 

Speaker 3 

We we feel your pain from the previous term anyway. 

Speaker 2 

Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to call it, it seems that you're in the majority of Caroline. That at least among people I talked to the the this term is the heavier term compared to last term. So I'm sorry, I'm very sorry and I'm very glad mine is over. So or. Yeah, you know. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So I I saw your e-mail, Scott said. Thank you for prompting us. I think we, Celine and I were just discussing that like a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting and I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah, that won't really help us. 

Speaker 2 

Great. 

Speaker 3 

But so there are two issues. There's there's the the clean data that you need. To be able to do anything. And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything. Are those the two main issues for you? 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, that's exactly right. And and for whatever it's worth, I feel like we're really close the but, but but yeah, that's that. That's exactly right. Caroline the the. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So, Doctor Moser, you have sent me last time and you. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And taught me to do that bootstrapping, and so I also. Told to Caroline. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

While we're waiting, I didn't do anything when I saw you on Tuesday, I said to you, I I will send you something Thursday, but I couldn't get. I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person, like me and you. 

Speaker 2 

That's OK. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together, so I will be on Monday. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

On campus, would you have timed them to me? 

Speaker 2 

Monday. Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon. Three or four. 

Speaker 1 

Can you do before 1:00 PM or before noon? 

Speaker 2 

No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1:00 PM, I think. Hang on. No. OK, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

One 1:00 PM. I can't do it. 1:00 PM until 2:00. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then from three until 4:00, and then from 5:00 until 6:00. So I could do from 1:00 until no. From I could do from 2:00 PM until 3:00 PM. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Uh, 2:00 PM should work, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that should work. 

Speaker 1 

This Monday on like on Monday 2:00 PM. Yeah, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Do you mind sending me a a. A teams invite? We can meet where we can meet my office. Your office? Or coffee or. 

Speaker 1 

Let's meet in your office. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine. That's fine. It's the, but the the main thing, the most urgent thing, I think, is this. Data issue is the is the. I just don't understand what's. Did my question make sense or am I just confused? 

Speaker 1 

Which question? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly right. My question about the about the data and the code books. 

Speaker 1 

So you you have, you have asked some of the code and I say the code book that I had sent in end of November beginning of end of November, this is also the latest one. So this should be the most recent updated code book that we have. And then you had also a question about. 

Speaker 2 

Uh-huh. OK, good. Good. 

Speaker 1 

The the the referrals. The phone numbers? Yeah, 4:50. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it's well, yeah, because the data. Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So for that is. In our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or 10. But we said we will only accept up to five. Yeah, just the first thing. The second information is. 

Speaker 2 

Uh-huh. OK. 

Speaker 1 

Even if people have referred, let's say, seven people or five, it doesn't mean they have been successful with Pharrell. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. That's right. No, of course. Right, of course. 

Speaker 1 

So that's why in order to. And. How many referrals we had? Eventually we we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID and at the wave so that we can identify which I which person or ideal recruiter has successfully recruited. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. 

Speaker 1 

Will refer to people. 

Speaker 2 

You know, I I got that. And you're, of course you're right that that the the successful recruiting referrals aren't the same as referrals is and and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The the the issue is is is really just one of the variables it looks like. Some people refer up to 99 people, and that's or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine up to 10. Yeah, but then. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

There's these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be 3 phone numbers and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number. So like. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So. Some underserved you people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone. And some other people could only refer three or four people, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. That's right. No, but but the. 

Speaker 3 

That doesn't explain the gap talking about. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Let let me share share my screen if you don't mind, and it's probably easier to to just look at it. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, please. 

Speaker 2 

If I have to figure. Out how to share my? Screen. Let's try that. Hopefully that's working. Can you? The. Like so, so, so so, like here. This is. These are like, great examples. So I'm OK. So first, let me pop over to the code book and there, there, there is. There's no coding after Q90. My understanding is that Q 105 here. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Up to Q110 were the referrals that were used, so those were the cube coupons that were given. But then you've got this person who refers, you know, nine people. That's fine, that makes sense. But look at this person. This person refers 3 phone numbers and then. They refer 6 nothings and then they refer and then there's a phone number way over here or take this person. Their Q 105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I I just don't understand how this happens. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So for starters. Is my understanding correct that that this? Is the possible set of phone numbers. Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five that we don't have to give the coupons, and that's great. And that's actually super helpful. But the the reason I'm asking is because our last our last meeting we had this. We we had this observation, I think Caroline had a great suggestion. I don't remember, but there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people. And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should we should, we should fix that up. And that's right. And then I was thinking, well, hang on, that logic applies to everybody. So if you say, you know, two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give 5 phone numbers. That same logic applies, and we should still fix up that that, that number, and so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give. And and I and I like so for this row. What what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is? It. Four or can we not tell? 

Speaker 1 

In in that case that you have highlighted. It would before. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

444 people. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's excellent that I understand. And so and and likewise so this for this other number would be 9. Yeah. OK, so basically I shouldn't worry about the OR the gaps or the ordering? 

Speaker 1 

949. I think you shouldn't worry about the gaps in between the phone number referrals and if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the the printed survey from the jest system so you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer. So. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

That would be. 

Speaker 1 

The people were. 

Speaker 2 

That would be wonderful. Yes, thank you. That's that's super wonderful. But now even even this conversation is super helpful, because now I know the. 

Speaker 1 

Service. 

Speaker 2 

The number of phone numbers that a person gave, and that was the missing piece that I was. I was, yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess. But. But so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can. Oh, I'm going to take this off and and that's great news. Thank. You. I will, I will. How do I stop? I will. I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff. And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're we're we're we're virtually ready. Oh, the the population estimate. Yes. Caroline, what your thoughts on on that? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So I've been tracking the Europeans on this and they have a category that they call personal household services, PHS, and they've started to collect data on this. And it comprises 2 elements. So there's the I just jotted down the details that I found so they have social work without accommodation, which has an NAACP code 88, and then they have an activities of households as employers of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97 now. That is also a sick. Code for the UK this activity, so that's very closely linked to domestic workers. That second one is tightly bounded and then I found a. 

Speaker 

Hmm. 

Speaker 3 

An analysis that included UK figures from 2017, so it's not too far away and and it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Respectively. So the social work without accommodation is that bigger figure and then the activities of households and employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. 

Speaker 3 

So the the paper they they've got some trends for other countries and they I mean I think we can make an argument that. They're broadly static. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

You're saying we're not very sensitive, so the question then is. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

For us, do we want to combine them right to have this that gives you the 1,000,000 figure that I think or roughly a million or do we want to take this smaller lower number than 51,000? That's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure number is larger than that, it's 79,000. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

So. 

Speaker 2 

So I'm I think I'm surgery. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000. 

Speaker 3 

929,000. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, wow. OK my mistake and and what were the codes again? I'm sorry, NBC, I don't know this. 

Speaker 3 

N A/C EI don't know what it stands for, but N A/C E 88 which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an e-mail, so you've got this. 

Speaker 2 

OK. OK. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. OK, good. 

Speaker 3 

That's right. And N A/C E 97, which is this activities households as employers of domestic personnel. 

Speaker 2 

Which is that? Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

So think that probably could now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through your stat and try and pull out something more recent, but if? Yeah, I was like, yeah, I agree. Yeah. So but that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range. Yeah, from. We've got lower and upper limits, haven't we and? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

That, perhaps is the most. 

Speaker 2 

Yep, I think that's a great idea and. 

Speaker 3 

Conservative approach. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the uh, the, I don't know what. I'm sorry, I don't know where the 1.7 million came from, but the. It's really. It it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like, once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all. I haven't played with things as as small as 5051 thousand, but I, I well and I think you're right. I think the I think we say you know, here's the number that we're using. 

Speaker 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 2 

Site site site in the appendix. Here's the robot. Here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change, and I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said. Like from 900 to 1,000,000 to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher like nothing changes. So so I I don't know about the lower so but I'll play with this. So I think this is please don't spend any more. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Time on I. Mean please do save the citation so we can we can, you know, cite the. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes, I've got. Yeah, I've. I've logged it across in an e-mail to you. What? What I've just told you now. So we've got you. We've got the link. 

Speaker 2 

Say the same thing. 

Speaker 1 

Brilliant. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. OK. Well, I can. I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon. 

Speaker 3 

Some of the numbers. 

Speaker 2 

Should we meet next week or if, if Salim can get the well, that's that entire. I can have. I can have everything except the in sum. Polished by next Friday and depending on how our meeting goes on Monday. Celine. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer, I don't know, but but the just from the just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. Would a 3:00 meeting next week be alright? And got something in for two already? Yeah. Does that work for you? 

Speaker 2 

Sure. No problem. 

Speaker 3 

Celine. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, as long as it's after. Afternoon is fine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So we said three. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it's fine. It's fine for. 

Speaker 3 

Me. I'll send something across. 

Speaker 2 

Sounds great. 

Speaker 1 

I also sent meeting. Link Dr. Moser just now for 2:00 PM. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And so how do you how should I prepare for this meeting? What do you? Yeah, how should? 

Speaker 1 

I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions here and some small questions there so that you can guide me so you don't need to prepare this one then it will be just about that. 

Speaker 3 

Sure, that's fine. 

Speaker 2 

Sure, sure, sure. Well, OK, OK. You said you said OK, alright, alright. Sounds, sounds sounds good. And thanks. Like I said, this is. It's very helpful for me. So thanks. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. No, it's it's just it just it's tantalising now isn't it cause it was I think we're guessing as you say we're getting close. So it's really just just delivering. 

Speaker 2 

Close, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Now I think it was. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, no, no. I didn't mean it critically silly. I'm not at all. In fact, I was. No, no, no. I'm not saying anything critical. It's just I was just, let's get it done. Let's get it done. We can we can. We can do it. So thanks. Thanks so much. And I hope you have find some time to enjoy the weekend and we'll talk in. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Yeah, I don't sleep good to see you soon.
