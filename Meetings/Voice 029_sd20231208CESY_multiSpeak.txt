Speaker 1 

Hello. Hi, can you hear me? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, we can hear you, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Excellent. Sorry I'm late. I slipped my mind. I was at the coffee shop and then popped up. Anyway, sorry I'm late. Sorry, nice to see you all. How are you? Staying warm, I hope. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, great. How are you doing? Cause you were, I think you had a doctor's appointment last week. Are you OK? 

Speaker 1 

Health better. Thank you. Yeah, I'm cold, but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it. But yeah, I've been marking hell. So how are you all? 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thank you. Yes. Been doing a little bit of teaching, but just a couple of skills days for social policy. Social workers. So yeah, most of my teaching takes place next term, so I've got. I'll be buried next in semester 2. 

Speaker 3 

I'm good. 

Speaker 1 

Excellent. Well, so yeah. I I'm I'm. I'm I'm I'm I'm the opposite. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but yes, enjoy. Enjoy while you can. I haven't touched anything since we last talked, but that said it's still probably a good idea to touch base and see. What's next or what's where? Where we are just so we don't sort of get off track. Thanks a ton for the draft, I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I found the the sources and I gave it a quick read, but I haven't really done anything. I'm sorry, I've just been buried with teaching and grading so sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's OK. I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it. So it is. It is a first draft, it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and Selim might be able to contribute like sections of text. So hopefully I'm not asking you to put in anything that you're not not able and willing to contribute. 

Speaker 1 

No. Yes, of course. Thank you. I missed that though. Can you? What? What? I don't have it open. What? So I mean, obviously the the result, the methods and the results, but yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. So I've got some methodology down there, but there's obviously you you're closer to the detail of what you're doing. So yeah, methodology and results, that's it. And then once we've got that in and we can revisit the discuss. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And I've put some points down, but there will obviously be more coming out when we've got a A for the paper to work with. The other thing I'm aware that is outstanding is you'd asked us if they're given the quite high proportion that we're coming out with, whether we could just look at some simple statistics to see whether. That proportion seemed sensible and wondering Selim, have you seen that e-mail? Is that something you might be able to do? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

For us, you mean the article? 

Speaker 2 

No, the Scott's last e-mail about taking, just doing a sense check against the proportion figure that he's finding. 

Speaker 3 

No, I didn't. I I told you just now. But also for you doctor model. So I had in the last 2-3 weeks my annual review, the preparation and also the exam. That's why I didn't time with anything else. But it went well. So I passed a new review and yeah, so just update me quickly. Caroline, please. 

Speaker 2 

So I'll forward you the e-mail from Scott cause I've got it and then if you can just take it. It's not a big job, I don't think. But if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your findings. I mean Scott's very kindly indicated which questions it relates to. So it's it's literally a, a percentage, I think isn't it's got. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, the issue is just that the so we've got these like fancy schmancy techniques which are great and very preliminarily, I, I and this was weeks ago, I I I. Sup. Since then and I only had One Cup of coffee today, so this is all danger. But the the sort of where? I. Parked it mentally is we have some initial estimates using these. These sort of next generation snowball samples, for lack of a better phrase, and that is not a very good phrase. And doing that gave some really high at least it seemed to me, really high in numbers and so. I was just thinking aloud to to to Caroline, and I'd welcome any and all inputs. Is is. Just as like, what if we don't do fancy smancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the the proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern slavery? Like what is that number? I don't know that number. And whatever that number is, it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have random sample etc etc etc. But just as a something to compare to. The I don't remember the exact numbers. Caroline do. Do you remember? It was. It was in the thousands, though, wasn't it in? 

Speaker 2 

The well, it was a proportion that you gave us, wasn't it was sort of 30% or something. 

Speaker 1 

Is it proportionate? That's right, that's right. Yeah, which just sounds really high. I mean, again, is the proportion of. Of my of domestic workers who I I think, yeah, plausibly we can say even a subset of those that are that are from the Philippines or from Latin America I think because that. We're not explicitly sampling that population, but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population. I think so. And so that the percentage just seemed to sound high to me, but I don't know anything about this, so. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Well, it's possible because they have no protection. And yeah, and and that's what I I think it is possible I think it, but I think it and I think it would attract interest. So it would be good to be as sure as we can about what we're saying because this seems to be quite a an interest. There's a lot of interest in this topic when. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Jim and I published the preliminary report just looking at the descriptive. Sticks. We got a lot of media attention for that. 

Speaker 1 

OK, that's great. 

Speaker 2 

So that was not really as exciting as what we're doing here. So I'm sure there would be continued interest from, I mean there's Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today, he's sort of following our work at the Rights lab. He always keeps an idea, an eye on what press releases we create. So he would. 

Speaker 1 

Nice. 

Speaker 2 

I'm sure pick it up again. That's great. Yeah, it is. I mean, from a an impact point of view, it's. It's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd include ours in that, but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has produced a report, but it's just descriptive statistics like us. So this really does move the conversation forward and I think. 

Speaker 

Ah. 

Speaker 1 

But that's great if there's if the. I'm sorry, you're. 

Speaker 2 

Good, now it says like with the change of government, if we presumably we get the change of government, then there there's a task force which is charged with looking at this issue within the first 100 days. So it's potentially got policy impact. So I think some Andrea Rain is leading something. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 2 

This that a colleague at Nottingham Trent mentioned to me, so this is the sort of thing that her team would be interested in picking up as well. So it could be really timely. 

Speaker 1 

This is bent. This I really want to be done with grading and get back to this. This is really exciting. And that's what I was gonna say is the the. I wasn't aware of these. We're advocacy groups. I wasn't aware of sort of the specificity that like you mentioned, there's like a what was a Latin American women's. You know, that's great if if we can can and obviously you are connected to that, but that's that would be like you said that would be, yeah, I mean the more now we're having conversation and the. 

Speaker 2 

When it's right started, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Once we start sort of subsetting it down the the the the proportion, the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this conversation, so that's very exciting. If OK, there's a big caveat. The big caveat there is. So thank you, Caroline again for the opportunity and I completely agree with you that like if we can do some quantity stuff with this, yeah, that would be, you know like way better than I did. But like that's that's a contribution. It makes you a little bit anxious because it makes me think like, OK, well, we really got to get these numbers right then because like this isn't, you know, this isn't something that. There's sort of other. It's like there's a a pool of of this kind of quantity prevalence estimation that we can sort of, you know, well we're close or we're not so close. So we differ. But here's why like it's. Pretty new so. 

Speaker 2 

Just. Yeah, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I agree. And when Bernard Silverman produced the stats, the initial stats for modern slavery in the UK, he used multiple systems estimation to do that. And he produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by policymakers. Which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end, in that the the the situation was far worse than his estimation suggested. So I think you're just talking, you're part of the conversation, but the conversation keeps evolving. Yeah. And the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that are not. Correct, but that are a way of engaging people in the debate. So I think as long as we're clear about what we've done, how we've got to that, I think we're OK. 

Speaker 1 

That's a really. I think that's thank you for that, Karen. That's a really great perspective and and not one that I. Had so. So just to paraphrase, you're saying. Like, well, I mean. I mean essentially like that's how science works is you, you make some mess and you do some research and then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed or whatever. And I I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly kind. Of like well. I gotta make sure this number is, you know, right or this method is really justified. And I think you're right, that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Sort of not. That's a luxury we don't have in this particular research domain, and that's just that's that's that, right? That's that's that's not. It's not a sin against us. That's a nice perspective. I like that. That's thank you for that, Caroline. That's a good one. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, I think it's just listening to Bernard talked about his experience and yeah, I mean, I think he said that the number of slaves were between 11 and 13,000 and then later estimates suggested up to 148,000. So I mean, that was quite a significant change in the number, but. 

Speaker 1 

Right. I just, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

His his paper started that conversation and yeah. So I think it's just viewing it as this is a contribution to the debate based on these particular methods. 

Speaker 1 

Right, right. Sounds good. OK, so when I get time when? When I'm out of marking hell. What's the what's the? What's the next step or help reorient me, please. As to. 

Speaker 2 

Revealed that. 

Speaker 1 

What? What? What I can do? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I think it's trying to flesh out that draft, so I'll I can go back to it and Polish up what I've written and make sure that it cause it's not a bit less stream of consciousness and but actually it needs input from you and Celine as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The the skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit. Once you've had a chance to have a look at, it's got perhaps where you think. We might target it and whether it needs. The the sort of context setting. To. 

Speaker 1 

Good point. 

Speaker 2 

To appeal to the audience, that's the journal that we think we want to go for. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Good. OK. Thank you. That's helpful. 

Speaker 2 

And I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in Word, and I think you you do understand latex, don't you? So it might be better actually to write it in latex, which I've never used. But perhaps if we can get the draft up to a certain standard, you would be able to then transfer it for us. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, absolutely. No, it's fine, actually. And there's there's. So back in the day. You're. Right, that in fact one of my early collab. Craters. So I use latex and he didn't and we had this project and he early on he was. He was like we're never gonna publish this because we just we're just gonna clash. And so anyway I'm trying to say back in the day there was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions. It's really pretty straightforward to convert. So we can. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, are they OK, good. So we could still. 

Speaker 1 

We can still, we can still we still talk to each other should be. 

Speaker 2 

Well. 

Speaker 1 

Should be OK. 

Speaker 2 

That's right. That's right. 

Speaker 1 

But yeah, that's a good point. Salem, do you mind taking a step? I don't know. What? What let review in terms of like the methods, needs, needs or is desired, but do you feel comfortable taking a stab at that so you know the? Basically, I think I've sent along at this point troll the troll, the trove of emails I've sent. I think there's A and Caroline as well. A number of papers that that address the kinds of methods that we're using, question mark. 

Speaker 3 

So I I have written down for now. And the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the methods section in the article that Caroline sent and the second task is the forwarded e-mail. So it seems there are some task I I just had a glance into it. Look into the e-mail that Caroline just now forwarded and then asked that. For you, Doctor Mose, you're asking for some information from my end, so I will look into that. And what else is there? 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the method section of the paper I've already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies. Yeah, so? OK, so there there is a method section there. And and then. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but it's gonna be very sharp, right? 

Speaker 2 

It's OK. I mean, the whole paper is 4000 words. Currently, I don't know quite what we're we're targeting, what length we're targeting, but I've asked you specifically if you could add the network structure graphic. You remember that we put that that actually visualizes the structure of the network. And and the way the extent to which it's constructed of different waves. So that was that section. That, yeah, if you could put that section in. And then I've asked, Scott, if he could include the point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated. And then. The bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Because you know what you've done? Not so. That's those those areas are indicated in the paper. I'll just put them in. They're indicated at the moment in just normal text. I've just put them in bold. So you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier. 

Speaker 

Thank you. That's great. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And then obviously I'll I can Polish up the text, but I I don't want to spend too much time. Doing that until. 

Speaker 1 

Results. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, until we know what the over, whether it sort of hangs together as an overall narrative, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

I'll. Thank you very much, Carolina. See it. It's it's. I see what has to be done and I don't have time to do it today. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, that's the big the big problem. 

Speaker 3 

Isn't it? I could do my part or what? The weekend, and also in in, in the beginning of next week. So I'm I'm more free. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Now, great. Excellent. 

Speaker 2 

Is your. Did your timetable get a bit better in the new year then Scott? Is that going to be, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it it gets. It gets better until about I have one of these intensive things and and I plan to work. So things will get a lot better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Fiercely then. But. Yeah, for about. Not quite a week, but essentially next week I'm. I'm yeah. Anyway, it's. I mean, I see what has to be done. I can't wait to do it. And and I'm so sorry, but I simply can't right now, right. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, that's, I mean, I completely understand the teaching is something you can't ignore. 

Speaker 1 

And and and marking is just so many and the oh so many, so many, so many. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. Yeah, I feel your pain. 

Speaker 1 

Will you be? I'll sadly, or I don't know. For better. So I'll. I'll probably work over parts of the break probably until late December and e-mail and what I'm trying to say is. I'll. I'll work on this likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope you're. With your families. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'll try not to, I must admit. But my January is not too bad. So if if we can. 

Speaker 1 

In June. OK. 

Speaker 2 

And reconvene, perhaps in January. Does that suit you too, Celine? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I could do online because or even in person, I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week, but we could also meet online, so there's no problem. Yeah, online or doesn't matter. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 

Me. 

Speaker 2 

So would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've got something to in the diary to work to? 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. Yeah, let's do so. Ideally before the 15th of January maybe. 

Speaker 2 

What? What? 

Speaker 1 

And then agreed. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Do you want to pick a is Friday still going to be? Good for you, Scott. 

Speaker 1 

I mean, until teaching start, I think I don't even know my timetable for next next term, but the yeah, Fridays should be should be fine. So I I do something before the before the 15th, but after the 4th would be good for me. I think I'll. I think I'll be traveling until the 4th. So I don't know maybe. 

Speaker 3 

Add the 12th Friday the 12th June. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the 12, what's that like? 

Speaker 1 

Sure. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. And does this time work? 

Speaker 1 

Looks great for me. 

Speaker 2 

This, this, this a meeting at this time work. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, it works for me. 11:00 AM again. 

Speaker 1 

Great, good. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, let's put that in and then we'll see where we are. I'll just do. 

Speaker 1 

That's it. That's great. That's that's that's a great deadline and that the plan gives me enough time to. That's great. That's a great deadline for me. Thank you. That's. Right. 

Speaker 2 

And still in if you just add your section into the current document and that's in the shared file, then we've got 1 shared copy that we're all working on. That would be great. 

Speaker 3 

We have done that before so should be fine. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. We sort of know what we're doing with. That so that's great. 

Speaker 1 

Oh yeah, since it's on the share or the OneDrive. Is that right? OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, it is. It's it's not in the folder that you set up those spots cause I don't seem to have access to put things in there, but it is it's. On the OneDrive. 

Speaker 1 

OK, good. 

Speaker 

Thanks. 

Speaker 2 

The links in the e-mail I can resend it if you think that would be useful. 

Speaker 1 

Couldn't hurt you. Couldn't hurt. I'm sure. I'm sure I have it. But if you don't mind, that would be great. Yeah. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, let me see if I can hunt it out. 

Speaker 1 

Or don't worry about it. I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we'll just see if I can find it. Here we are. OK. Right. I just resent the the e-mail, so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your inbox now. 

Speaker 1 

Brilliant. Thanks a ton. Thanks a ton. Oh, good. That's great. So like I said, I like this deadline. And now I must return to marking, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Smoking. Yes, and he might need more coffee. 

Speaker 1 

I absolutely do. So please, please, please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because vicariously is the only way I will. Get to enjoy it so. 

Speaker 3 

So, doctor, more than I have been told by another academic staff when I told, they told me during these two weeks of marking treaties. Now eat the candies, eat fast food, or just to treat yourself from the marking, marking stress. 

Speaker 1 

That's great. I I will thank you. That's great. I'll, I'll. I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well. That's. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Should do some fantastic. 

Speaker 2 

Guys, OK. Won't hold you anymore. Then stop. Good catch up. I'm glad you're feeling better. 

Speaker 1 

Really great to see you all and and and and. Yeah, I look forward to. Proceeding. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Let's see if we can get something in the new year. Good. See you. 

Speaker 3 

And then I see your. 

Speaker 1 

Bye. Happy holidays, everyone. Take care. Bye. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Thank you. Bye. Bye then.
