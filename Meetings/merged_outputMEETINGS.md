**CarolineE:**  
Yeah, all good. Thank you. Just discussing the some question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns.

**ScottM:**  
Good. How are you? Good. Yeah, it just never ends. It's just, it's just, yeah. Anyway.

**CarolineE:**  
We feel your pain from the previous term anyway.

**ScottM:**  
Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to colleagues, it seems that you're in the majority of Carolina that at least among people I talked to, this term is the heavy term compared to last term. So I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. And I'm very glad mine is over, so or yeah, you know.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah. So I saw your email, Scott. Thank you for prompting us. I think Celine and I were just discussing a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah, that won't really help us.

**ScottM:**  
Great.

**CarolineE:**  
But so there are two issues. There's the clean data that you need to be able to do anything. And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything. Are those the two main issues for you?

**ScottM:**  
Yes, that's exactly right. And for whatever it's worth, I feel like we're really close. But yeah, that's exactly right, Caroline.

**SelimY:**  
So, Doctor Moser, you have sent me last time and you taught me to do that bootstrapping. And so I also told to Caroline.

**Speaker:**  
Yeah.

**SelimY:**  
While we're waiting, I didn't do anything. When I saw your Tuesday, I said to you, I will send you something. Yeah, but I couldn't get. I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person like me and you.

**ScottM:**  
That's okay.

**SelimY:**  
So that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together. I will be on Monday on campus. Would you have time then?

**ScottM:**  
Monday. Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon three or four.

**SelimY:**  
Can you do before 1 PM or before noon?

**ScottM:**  
No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1 PM. I think, hang on. I can't do it 1 PM until 2 PM and then from 3 PM until 4 PM and then from 5 PM until 6 PM. So I could do from 2 PM until 3 PM.

**ScottM:**  
2 PM should work, yeah.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, that should work. On Monday.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, do you mind sending me a team's invite? We can meet where we can meet, my office, your office, coffee.

**SelimY:**  
Let's meet in your office.

**ScottM:**  
That's fine. But the main thing, the most urgent thing, I think, is this data issue. I just don't understand what's, did my question make sense or am I just confused?

**SelimY:**  
Which question?

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, exactly right. My question about the data and the code books.

**SelimY:**  
You asked something about the code book and I think the code book that I had sent in end of November, this is also the latest one. This should be the most recent updated code book that we have. And then you had also a question about the referrals to phone numbers.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, it's, well, yeah, because the data, yeah, exactly.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, so for that is, in our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or ten, but we said we will only accept up to five. Yeah, just the first thing. The second information is, even if people have referred, let's say, seven people, five, it doesn't mean they have been successful.

**ScottM:**  
No, of course. Right, of course.

**SelimY:**  
So that's why, in order to understand how many referrals we had eventually, we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID, and at the wave, so that we can identify which person ID recruiter has successfully recruited or referred people.

**ScottM:**  
I got that. And of course, really, the successful recruit referrals aren't the same as referrals, and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The issue is really just one of variables. It looks like some people refer up to nine people, and that's, or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine.

**SelimY:**  
Up to ten, yeah.

**ScottM:**  
But then there are these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be three phone numbers, and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, so on the survey, people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone, and some other people could only refer three or four people.

**ScottM:**  
That doesn't explain the gap.

**CarolineE:**  
Let me share my screen if you don't mind, and probably easier to just look at it.

**SelimY:**  
Please.

**ScottM:**  
I have to figure out how to share my screen. Let's try that. Hopefully, that's working. Can you see my Excel?

**SelimY:**  
Yeah.

**ScottM:**  
These are great examples. Okay, so first let me pop over to the code book, and there's no coding after Q90. My understanding is that Q105 here, up to Q110, were the referrals that were used. So those were the coupons that were given. But then you've got this person who refers nine people. That's fine. That makes sense. But look at this person. This person refers three phone numbers, and then they refer six nothings, and then there's a phone number way over here. Or take this person. Their Q105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I just don't understand how this happens.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah.

**ScottM:**  
So for starters, is my understanding correct that this is the possible set of phone numbers? Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five, that we don't actually give the coupons, and that's great. And that's actually super helpful. But the reason I'm asking is because at our last meeting, we had this observation. I think Caroline had a great suggestion. But there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people. And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should fix that up. And that's right. And then I was thinking, well, hang on. That logic applies to everybody. So if you say you know two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give five phone numbers, that same logic applies. And we should still fix up that number. And so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give. And I, like, so for this row, what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is it four? Or can we not tell?

**SelimY:**  
In that case that you have highlighted before.

**ScottM:**  
Okay, good. Thank you.

**SelimY:**  
It would be four people.

**ScottM:**  
Okay, that's excellent. That's what I understand. And so and likewise so this for this other number would be nine. Yeah. Okay, so basically I shouldn't worry about the or the gaps or the ordering?

**SelimY:**  
I think you shouldn't worry about gaps in between the phone number referrals. And if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the printed survey from the just system. So you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer. People were filled out.

**ScottM:**  
That would be wonderful. Yes. Thank you. That's super wonderful. But now even this conversation is super helpful because now I know the number of phone numbers that a person gave. And that was the missing piece that I was I was. Yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess. But so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can. Oh, I'm going to take this off. And and that's great news. Thank you. I will. I will. How do I stop? I will. I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff. And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're virtually ready to go. Oh, the population estimate. Yes, Caroline, what were your thoughts on on that?

**CarolineE:**  
I've been tracking the Europeans on this, and they have a category that they call personal household services PHS. And they've started to collect data on this. And it comprises two elements. So there's the just jotted down the details that I found. And they have social work without accommodation, which has a NAC code 88. And then they have an activities of households as employees of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97. Now that is also a sick code for the UK, this activities. So that's very closely linked to domestic workers. That second one is tightly bounded.

 An analysis that included UK figures from 2017. So it's not too far away. And it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000 respectively. The social work without accommodation is that bigger figure. And then the activities of households as employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure.

**ScottM:**  
Excellent.

**CarolineE:**  
So the paper, they've got some trends for other countries, and they, I mean, I think we could make an argument that they're broadly static.

**ScottM:**  
Okay.

**CarolineE:**  
You're saying we're not very sensitive. So the question then is, for us, do we want to combine them to have this that gives you the one million figure that I think, or roughly a million, or do we want to take this smaller lower number of 51,000 that's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure number is larger than that. It's 79,000.

**ScottM:**  
Right.

**CarolineE:**  
So.

**ScottM:**  
So hang on. I think I misread you. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000.

**CarolineE:**  
929,000.

**ScottM:**  
Oh, wow. Okay. My mistake. And what were the codes again? I'm sorry. NAC? I don't know this.

**CarolineE:**  
N-A-C-E. I don't know what it stands for. But N-A-C-E-88.

**ScottM:**  
Okay.

**CarolineE:**  
Which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an email. So,

**ScottM:**  
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.

**CarolineE:**  
That's all right. And N-A-C-E-97, which is this activities of households as employers of domestic personnel.

**ScottM:**  
Which is that, yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
So I think that probably can now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through Eurostat and try and pull out something more recent. But if, yeah, that's what I was hoping.

**ScottM:**  
I agree.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
But that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
From we've got lower and upper limits, haven't we?

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, exactly.

**CarolineE:**  
But perhaps is the most.

**ScottM:**  
Yep, I think that's a great idea.

**CarolineE:**  
Conservative approach.

**ScottM:**  
Yes, I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the, I don't know what, I'm sorry. I don't know where the 1.7 million came from. The, it's really, it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all. I haven't played with things as small as 50, 51,000. But I will. And I think you're right. I think the range, I think we say, you know, here's the number that we're using, site, site, site. In the appendix, here's the robot, here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change. And I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said, it was like from 900 to a million to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher, like nothing changes. So, so I, and I don't know about the lower. So I'll, but I'll play with this. So I think this is, please don't spend any more time on, I mean, please do save the citation. We can, we can, you know, site the site the site.

**CarolineE:**  
Yes, I've logged it across in an email to you. Really, what I've just told you now. So we've got, we've got the link to the numbers.

**ScottM:**  
Good. Okay. Well, I can, I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon. Should we meet next week or if, if Selene can get the, well, that's not entirely off. I can have everything except the in some polished by next Friday. And depending on how our meeting goes on Monday, Selene. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer. I don't know. But, but with the input, just from the input, just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure.

**CarolineE:**  
That's great. Would a three o'clock meeting next week be all right?

**ScottM:**  
Sure.

**CarolineE:**  
I've got something in for two.

**ScottM:**  
No problem.

**CarolineE:**  
Already.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
Does that work for you, Selene?

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, as long as it's after afternoon is fine.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah, so we said three.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, it's all right. It's fine for me.

**CarolineE:**  
I'll send something across.

**SelimY:**  
I also sent a meeting link.

**ScottM:**  
Thank you.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah. And so how, how do you, how should I prepare for this meeting? What are you?

**SelimY:**  
I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions. Yeah. And some small questions. So that's fine. You can guide me. Sure. So you don't need to prepare anything. Just about that.

**CarolineE:**  
Sure, that's fine.

**ScottM:**  
Sure, sure, sure. Okay. All right. All right. Sounds, sounds sounds good. And thanks for, like I said, this was very helpful for me. So thanks. That's great.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah. No, it's just, it just is tantalizing now, isn't it? Cause it was, I think we, we get it, as you say, we're getting close. So close. It's really just, just delivering now.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean it critically, Selene. Not at all. And in fact, I was, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything critical. It's just, I, I'm with Caroline, like we just, let's get it done. Let's get it done. We can, we can, we can do it. So thanks. Thanks so much. And I hope you have find some time to enjoy the weekend. And we'll talk in a week.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah, good to see you.

**SelimY:**  
Thanks, guys.

**ScottM:**  
See you.

**SelimY:**  
Bye, everybody.

**Speaker 4:**  
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care. Jimmie crack corn and I don't care. Jimmie crack corn, but I don't care. Oh, Jimmie crack corn and I don't care. My master's gone away. That's the lyrics. Oh, okay. Lordy, Lordy. Here we go again. You're going again. Same French guy. All right, sir. Hey, Oh, oh. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Oh man. This is your first probability at the 10 I was here, I've been here until 6 AM.

**Speaker:**  
Okay. You could shut up and have a draw.

## Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUp1.txt
Hello. Hi, Carolyn. This is Scott, obviously. I'm really sorry for missing our Monday meeting
I've been and am in administrative duties hell Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then
I returned to marking hell. So I have done work and I wanted to try and update you and
my typing is quite poor and my spelling is even worse. So I thought one quickly would
just be to send you a recording. So here's a somewhat, I tried to organize my thoughts,
but right. Here's a suit. Here's where I'm at and what I was hoping to have discussed
with you on Monday, but again, I missed it. So I'm, I'm, I'm sorry about that. Okay.
So, bring it up. Here we go. I think the first thing for me when approaching when
re-approaching this, and I think I've got my head around, I've re got my, I've got my head
re around these things. So I start with conceptualization and population, which let me call the setting.
So the first question is what is the population? I think we have a very clear answer to that
is domestic workers in the UK, more technically it is domestic workers in the UK that have
a mobile phone during survey fielding. Maybe that have had a cert that have had a mobile
phone in the calendar year proceeding the survey fielding, something like that. Okay.
So if that's the population, which I think that we're sampling from, which I believe
it is, and I think that's very well defined and that's fantastic. I think the target population,
this hidden population, so to speak, are domestic workers in the UK that have a cell
phone that have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There's
a few ways that we can operationalize that. You and Salim, and me a little bit, but really
it was all you, I think have come up with three very principled ways to do this. The
first two are dichotomies. So this would be a question 36 dichotomized. This is the simply
do you get paid less than the legal minimum wage. And question 80 also dichotomized, which
is have you been through the national referral mechanism, or have you been referred to the
national referral? To my mind, these are both very high bars. Like if people answer yes
truthfully to either of those questions, I think, and I'm not a subject of that expertise
whatsoever, but I think we can be very confident that yes, that person counts as a member of
the hidden population. I think that's true. We also discussed and you and Salim, mainly
you developed a continuous measure. So here the idea, I think, is conceptually different.
So in this third idea, which I think is called, sorry, I took notes and clearly I can, this
is like the some categories or some cut. The idea is you developed a series of indicators,
it sounds like eight or 12 or 16. And we just sort of normalize them and said, you know,
how many of these indicators, and actually there was a waiting to them, do you satisfied,
and then we're going to come up with some number between zero and one that represents your
exposure to the risk of experiencing modern slavery. So this can, if we use that as a
measurement, as a separate measurement, as a continuous measurement of not experiencing
modern slavery, but risk of experiencing modern slavery, that might sound like I'm splitting
hairs, but I think both methodologically in terms of dichotomies versus continuous,
but more importantly, I think conceptually, those are quite different, because in the latter
case, if we're, if we claim that we're measuring risk of exposure, then, then I think the population
is to be a little bit re, well, then the hidden population definitely needs to be redefined.
So the V population that we're sampling premise still domestic workers in the UK that have
a cell phone, yada, yada, yada. But in this third continuous operationalization of experiencing
modern slavery or more formally risk, let's call it a risk index, and I've called it like
24 different things, and I'm sorry. But in that world, we're asserting that everyone in
the population has some value of this variable. That is to say, everyone in the population,
domestic workers in the UK that we're sampling from, have some risk of experiencing modern
slavery, then that risk might be zero. Okay, fine. So, but, but again, conceptually, I think
that's important. Okay. So one, don't know if that's correct or not, but that's where I'm,
that's one, that's where I started with. Okay. So then, so we've got the population, we've got
the target population. So now how are we sampling? So where is this data coming from? So this, we
sort of spent a few rounds and months on this, but I think it was productive, although perhaps not
what you wanted to hear or I wanted to hear or whatnot. But I think where we landed was, well,
look, what do we have? We have a convenient sample. We have an RDS sample, a respondent-driven
survey in which the respondents are members of the population. We're sampling from domestic workers
in the UK that have a cell phone, right? Yada, yada, yada. We're sampling from that population.
Initially, there are seeds and then we're doing an RDS with five coupons to,
to, to branch out, to do the, the RDS or the, the, the modified snowballs, not exactly snowballs,
whatever. Okay. Again, these are my beliefs. So please, right, correct me if, if, if, if I'm
wrong. Okay. So that's the data that we have to work with. So now the question is, what do we
do with that data? I want to add one additional aspect to the, the data, the, the sample I should
say, let me separate that from the data we're talking about in a second. In, in that functionally,
the sample, again, none of this is criticism whatsoever, but functionally, the sample comes from
three groups or we're sampling from three subgroups within the population of domestic
workers in the UK that have a cell phone. Those are people from the Philippines, maybe they're here
on a visa, maybe they just identify as Philippine, no, Filipina. Latinx, again, by self-identified
origin, ethnicity, I don't remember the exact wording and other, and, and British born. And
that one, British born, I think pretty sure is a, is a, is actually asked. I don't have the question
number on, on me. So if we wanted to, we could say, okay, well, look, there's really within this
here sample, there's three distinct clusters by say, nationality. I think we, I think we could
assert that with veracity. It's been a long few days and it's only Tuesday. I'm sorry. Okay. So
that these natural three subgroups or clusters, Latinx, Filipino a and, and British born, I think.
Okay. All right. So that's the sample. So then let me, we've got, I hope you're drinking a lot of tea
or coffee and pausing and or deleting this video. Okay. So then before I get to analysis, I want to do
a few data issues. So, so one, do we know anything about these sizes? So do we know anything about
estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK? So I found two websites once
one's official UK is nationalcareers.service.gov.uk job groups. So they sort of,
I'm guessing it's census based, but they're, they're these job groupings. And another is from
some organization in the UK called BICS. I've already forgotten what that stands for. But
it looks like there's some maybe a sense of the number of domestic workers in the UK. It depends
on how you count like these, you know, is this home cleaning? Is it daycare? Is it institutionalized?
Is it not? And like I said, this is just a very preliminary thing. Okay. So that's one numbers.
One A numbers. Well, actually, we could estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from
your very clever sample because of the RDS nature. So one of the questions in the survey is how many
other domestic workers do you know in the UK? And then ask for some, some recruitment information.
But just asking the how many. So basically what I'm saying is we're sampling from the population
of domestic workers in the UK. And one of the questions is how many other people in this
population do you know? So we can use that information to estimate the size of the population
where the population means domestic workers in the UK. Okay. So that's another that's I'm exploring
that currently as a possible additional source of information. By the way, that is using older,
I'm just saying this for the record. Sorry. So that's using sort of the the
uh, guile at all, but the early stuff. So 2010, 2011, uh, stuff that the stuff we'll talk about
in a second. The for analysis is a bit later 2014, 2015, a bit later. Okay. So what I'm saying is
the population, we can try and estimate the size of the number of domestic workers in the UK,
which might be of interest for a number of reasons. For me is of interest because we need that number
for later calculations and that can come from a few sources. I found two online, maybe they're
valid, maybe they're not. The third is we could try and estimate that from your survey. I'm working
on that currently, but it's giving weird answers. Like it's way too small and it's taking way too
long to run. So whatever, I'm just saying that for the record. Okay. Now I don't remember what number
we're up to. Analysis. Uh, so step one, let's just take it from the literature. Let's do the
guile at all. So this is the so-called SSPS. So this is the successive sampling population size
estimates. And uh, Krista Guile, who again, small world, we were neighbors at it in our postdoc at
doctor comes up with this very clever way of exploiting additional information within RDS
samples that essentially takes into account. What's really cool about it is that it uses
when, at which wave did you appear in the sample as an additional piece of information?
And the idea being that those with larger personal networks, so if I'm a seed and I give two recruits,
odds are those two recruits have bigger social networks than say the other people
that I didn't recruit. Basically, that's the idea and, and so on and so forth. Okay. So it uses this
idea, which overcomes it. It mitigates a lot of biases that were in so-called RDA1 and RDA2,
sorry, RDS1 and RDS2. I've also seen it called RDSA and RDSB volts, etc, etc, etc. So this SSPSC
seems to be, as far as I can tell, pretty, pretty state of the art. Okay. So we can just take that
from the literature. We can do estimation. There's a few hiccups, but nothing that we can't overcome.
And we get proportions. We get proportions of the population, which currently we don't know the
size of, but we can come up with some sensible ways of estimating it that are experiencing,
that are in the hidden population, that are experiencing modern slavery, however defined,
via Q36 or Q80, both dichotomized, which again, to my mind, are very sort of high bars. Like,
if you're saying yes to either Q36 or Q80, again, dichotomized, like, there's very good,
if you're answering honestly, there's very, very good reasons to think that
you're a member of the hidden population, that you're a domestic worker in the UK with a cell
phone, mobile phone, sorry, American, that is being exploited, that is, that is experiencing
modern slavery. Okay. So we can do that. And then there's, there's some sort of very, very recent,
most recent I found was the McLaughlin at all, 2023. I don't even know if I've sent it around.
Sorry if I haven't. That says, yeah, yeah, that's great. But essentially, the number of people that
I report, it's really clever. It says basically, the number, I might not know the number of people
that I know. And so the number of people that I report shouldn't be taken too literally. Essentially,
you should be taken, sort of what they do is they just add a measurement error components. They say,
yeah, well, you might not actually know, you might not truthfully report the number of people that
you know that, that are in your personal network, that are in our world, that are domestic workers
in the UK that have such and such characteristics. Okay, so we can do all that. And I have done,
done that. And, and the answer is really high proportions, something like 30 to 40%.
Depending on a few, you know, which question we use, priors, which model, etc, etc. But
pretty consistently 30 to 40%. Sorry, let me say differently.
And concurrent with the preliminary stuff I sent, whatever it was, months ago,
something like 30, 40% of domestic workers in the UK, if that's the population,
we are estimating to be experiencing modern slavery again, depending on how we're defining it.
It's one of these two dichotomous, dichotomous variables. And, and again, you know, those
caveats, however, I will say this, I was worried about a few things. Because when I first saw that,
I thought, wow, that's really high. I thought. So maybe there's some convergence issues,
doesn't look like it looks like the things have converged pretty well.


## Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUp2.txt
This is embarrassing, I got, this reminds me that when I was younger, my parents would
call me the voicemail and sometimes my dad especially would just ramble and the voicemail
would cut off, he would have expired the maximal amount.
I think that just happened to me, I've been rambling at you for more than the allotted
time that Microsoft is letting me and yet here I go again.
So I'll do my best to try and send along some kind of summary transcript.
I'm sorry, this is me trying desperately to stay current and catch up on research of which
this is literally the number one priority and you see it that I'm already falling behind.
So I'm really sorry about that.
Okay, right, blah, blah, blah.
Where were we?
So there are these estimates and they seem, I believe them more than I did when I first
sent the preliminaries around.
Now there's still stuff to do, there's still robustness, this, that and the other, but these
numbers seem pretty high.
Okay, again, 30 to 40%, something like that.
Now there's a few caveats here, well I need to say caveats, there's a few things I need
to say.
The first is, I should have said earlier, isn't about the analysis, it's about the data
and data cleaning, so one thing and much appreciation to Salim, he's done a ton of work, but one
is, and this turns out to be a bit of a subtle issue at least in political science, so one
is how do you deal with the don't knows?
So some of the questions, for example, one of the questions, one of our indicator questions
about are you in this hidden population, how are you experiencing modern slavery, is
about referral to the national referral mechanism.
And one of the response answers is, for I don't know.
So the issue is, how do you deal with those?
And those I don't know sort of pop up and obviously in lots of other questions.
Currently in Salim's formulation, they're being coded as in the negative, no I'm not
whatever the question is asking, something just happened, oh my god, I feel like I'm
like one of the worst colleagues, I'm so sorry.
So an alternative approach is to classify them as missing, so essentially you say, well
look, if a person reports, I don't know if I've been referred to the national referral
mechanism, we're just going to ignore you for purposes of analysis.
We're not going to count you as no I haven't been referred.
So doing that actually weirdly increases very slightly the estimates of domestic workers
in the UK experiencing modern slavery.
So Salim's descriptive statistics were, if you do what I'm suggesting, which is to
treat the don't knows differently from either an affirmative or a negative, you get ever
so slightly higher descriptive statistics, higher proportions just raw from the sample
data.
And it's something, you know, it's like 42 to 44, 42 to 43 or something like this, I
mean it's not, they're not huge.
That's one issue too, this one's a bit trickier, 17 out of 97 people in the sample report knowing
zero domestic workers in the UK.
So that one of the questions that, in fact the question, I should be more clear, I'm
sorry Caroline, I'll try and clean up in the transcript, in the summary of the transcript,
say I know zero people in the population, which we've defined to be, if I'm thinking
about this correctly, domestic workers in the UK.
Right.
Okay.
Okay, so maybe they do, maybe that's true or maybe they don't, but then in terms of
this data cleaning business, but then some of them make referrals.
So among the 17 that say I know zero domestic workers in the UK, there's another question
that says, please give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK that you know,
where no is defined properly per your survey, and they'll give a cell phone number or two.
Which again, this is like a logical inconsistency, if you report a referral, and a referral
must be a domestic worker in the UK, then you cannot know zero domestic workers in the
UK.
So there's a few people in the survey like that.
So those zero, essentially what I'm saying is those zeros should actually be something
positive.
We don't actually know, but a conservative answer would be turn those zeros into ones.
So I haven't done that, but it's a handful of people.
I can't imagine it's going to matter, but there's a larger issue which is what to do
with these zeros.
So if you claim that you know zero, if a person in the sample claims they know zero domestic
workers in the UK, and like I said, there's 17 or so out of 97, so it's not nothing.
What do we do with those?
And the reason I say that is because the estimators that I've been using essentially
can't handle the zeros.
And the reason for that I hadn't thought very deeply about, but I guess kind of makes sense
in the following way.
The estimators that we're dealing with just extensively rely on social network information.
And so if there's a person in your sample that says essentially I have, I don't have
a social network, zero, then that causes some problems because the entire estimation
strategy of these different techniques are to exploit, are to use whatever social network
there is.
But if that's zero, then something breaks.
And to be honest, I haven't worked through the math.
So what do we do with those?
We could remove them.
Turns out that doesn't really matter too much.
We could try other techniques.
I haven't fully explored that.
I've explored that a little, and I don't really know what to make of it.
Or we could just really add hawk, like just add one to everybody's reported degree.
So all the zeros turn into ones, all the fives turn into sixes.
That's not principled whatsoever.
But it's another approach.
Okay.
So that's data stuff.
All right.
Now, with regard to results, which again, I've completely misordered this and hopefully
it will be temporarily correct in the accompanying outline should I get around to producing it.
So this 30, 40% business that I mentioned earlier, like I said, I believe it more than
I did when I sent you the initial plumber results, which were relatively similar.
The little convergence results, so we have this estimate that's doing a lot of math.
And the idea is it comes up with lots and lots and lots of estimates.
But when all these estimates get very, very close to each other, the algorithm stops and
says, okay, here it is.
And so you can look and see, you know, does it actually do that?
And the answer is yes.
It converges.
Okay.
So I'm relatively, I'm more confident in the numbers on resolve that.
Okay.
So what am I, I'm sorry, I need to look at, right.
So the number one is just, do we believe these results?
I've checked convergence preliminarily, it looks pretty good.
We could do sensitivity analysis.
That would be on me.
I've done a little bit of that.
And again, it seems, in my opinion, surprisingly robust, like, I don't remember my discussion
about frequentist versus Bayesian, but the idea is you put some prior information into
this, into this, into this estimator, like, for example, how many domestic workers are
there in the UK?
What is the size of the population?
Now, we don't know that number, but we have some belief about it.
The beliefs I've been using are something like 1.74 million, say 2 million, whatever.
So you can change that number.
And the resulting estimates are very, very similar, again, in this 30, 40% range.
There are other techniques.
So the techniques I've been using all assume that the graph is connected.
So what that means is that if we were to know everybody's social network, which we don't,
but if we were to know all of it, it's connected.
So functioning with that means is that if there's a Ecuadorian in our sample, that truly,
if we had the entire social network of all domestic workers in the UK, which we don't,
if we did, there'd be some path for that there domestic worker from Ecuador to any other
person, any other domestic worker in the UK, in particular to the Filipino worker who might
be in our sample or might not, to the British born, the British national, whatever.
So truly, they're all connected.
Now, I think I mentioned this, but there's, I think there's some reasons to think that
might not be true, that there really, there might be clusters or subgroups here, primarily
around language, I would guess, again, this isn't, I'm not a subject of expert, but that's,
so that's fine.
There are techniques to deal with that.
So we could, and I haven't, but we could pretty straightforwardly deal with, well, maybe there's
a Filipino, Filipino, a network, and maybe there's a Spanish speaking network, or maybe
there's a UK born network, and maybe those are different.
Maybe they're not, maybe they're all connected.
But we could, one might say, well, I don't really think that they're all connected.
So that's fine.
We can deal with that.
I haven't, but, but, but we can.
Okay.
So that's one thing.
So disaggregate by origin.
We got that.
Yeah.
Like I said, it's, it's, in my opinion, shockingly high.
And so, you know, there's the whole, do we believe it?
Oh, and then, right.
Okay.
So then there's a, there's, there's an entirely separate, to my mind, this is a third sort
of approach or strata estimation strategy, which is so far everything I've talked about
is sort of off the shelf RDS.
It's very sophisticated and involves tweaks, like visibility and measurement error, yada,
yada, yada, yada, yada, but it's very, our sample is RDS.
And we're trying to estimate the size of some population slash hidden population slash members
of the population with some particular categorical attribute, et cetera, which again, perfectly
fine fits the data fantastically.
It's not at all what I thought we initially started this project with, which was some
variant of in summer or network scale up in particular, you're very, very cool and very
novel idea to use the generalized GN sum here.
So the question is, can we use the data that we have to do some kind of in some ish estimation?
And the reason I'm sort of pushing this or advocating for this is because I think it's
much more.
My guess is it's going to be much more powerful because in some is using more information.
And it's not just, it's not just counting the number of, well, how do I say this?
So in some is very, very powerful.
The issue is if you don't have a random sample, what do you do about that?
And the answer is lots of weird math that essentially boils down to the linchpin for
us is what's called inclusion probabilities.
So we don't have a random sample we acknowledge that that's fine.
So how, what statistical tricks can we do to the data that we have in sample so as to
be able to justify and use techniques that are meant for analysis of random samples like
in some.
Okay, so there's an answer to that and the answer is waiting.
And I think there's some really, really nice intersections here and really pretty straightforward.
I haven't implemented them, but essentially we can use, we can derive weights from these
RDS estimators and logic and packages and R to come up with these inclusion probabilities.
And again, we can do a few robustness whatever and then throw use those in the in some calculations.
I haven't done that, but I'm really excited to do that because I think my hunch is that's
going to be much more powerful in that it's just it's sort of taking the best, it's squeezing
all the information that at least I am aware of out of the data that we that we actually
have.
Okay, I've been rambling the combined with that.
So I haven't done that.
So, so me, Scott Moser to do bootstraps, I've done some, I haven't done all of them.
Since the analysis against some, not a bunch, this, this third way, this in some plus RDS
weights, I'm very excited about, haven't touched it, I haven't touched it practically.
I have thought about it and have notes, which are a mess.
Okay, next topic presentation.
What do we want to present?
And how do we want to present it?
Cables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian plus series, what?
I don't know.
And if I'm being perfectly honest with Caroline, I don't, you know, I'm not really right now,
I'm not in a huge position to sort of produce like publication ready graphics or what have
you.
But I think that's a discussion that would help me at least.
Okay, I think I'm about to get cut off again.
So I'm going to stop.
This is what I was hoping to report, discuss, talk about with you on Monday.
And like I said, I had early failed.
Hopefully this has some meaning.


## Recording-20240116_CEmeetingMakeUpALL.txt
Hello. Hi, Carolyn. This is Scott, obviously. I'm really sorry for missing our Monday meeting
I've been and am in administrative duties hell Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then
I returned to marking hell. So I have done work and I wanted to try and update you and
my typing is quite poor and my spelling is even worse. So I thought one quickly would
just be to send you a recording. So here's a somewhat, I tried to organize my thoughts,
but right. Here's a suit. Here's where I'm at and what I was hoping to have discussed
with you on Monday, but again, I missed it. So I'm, I'm, I'm sorry about that. Okay.
So, bring it up. Here we go. I think the first thing for me when approaching when
re-approaching this, and I think I've got my head around, I've re got my, I've got my head
re around these things. So I start with conceptualization and population, which let me call the setting.
So the first question is what is the population? I think we have a very clear answer to that
is domestic workers in the UK, more technically it is domestic workers in the UK that have
a mobile phone during survey fielding. Maybe that have had a cert that have had a mobile
phone in the calendar year proceeding the survey fielding, something like that. Okay.
So if that's the population, which I think that we're sampling from, which I believe
it is, and I think that's very well defined and that's fantastic. I think the target population,
this hidden population, so to speak, are domestic workers in the UK that have a cell
phone that have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There's
a few ways that we can operationalize that. You and Salim, and me a little bit, but really
it was all you, I think have come up with three very principled ways to do this. The
first two are dichotomies. So this would be a question 36 dichotomized. This is the simply
do you get paid less than the legal minimum wage. And question 80 also dichotomized, which
is have you been through the national referral mechanism, or have you been referred to the
national referral? To my mind, these are both very high bars. Like if people answer yes
truthfully to either of those questions, I think, and I'm not a subject of that expertise
whatsoever, but I think we can be very confident that yes, that person counts as a member of
the hidden population. I think that's true. We also discussed and you and Salim, mainly
you developed a continuous measure. So here the idea, I think, is conceptually different.
So in this third idea, which I think is called, sorry, I took notes and clearly I can, this
is like the some categories or some cut. The idea is you developed a series of indicators,
it sounds like eight or 12 or 16. And we just sort of normalize them and said, you know,
how many of these indicators, and actually there was a waiting to them, do you satisfied,
and then we're going to come up with some number between zero and one that represents your
exposure to the risk of experiencing modern slavery. So this can, if we use that as a
measurement, as a separate measurement, as a continuous measurement of not experiencing
modern slavery, but risk of experiencing modern slavery, that might sound like I'm splitting
hairs, but I think both methodologically in terms of dichotomies versus continuous,
but more importantly, I think conceptually, those are quite different, because in the latter
case, if we're, if we claim that we're measuring risk of exposure, then, then I think the population
is to be a little bit re, well, then the hidden population definitely needs to be redefined.
So the V population that we're sampling premise still domestic workers in the UK that have
a cell phone, yada, yada, yada. But in this third continuous operationalization of experiencing
modern slavery or more formally risk, let's call it a risk index, and I've called it like
24 different things, and I'm sorry. But in that world, we're asserting that everyone in
the population has some value of this variable. That is to say, everyone in the population,
domestic workers in the UK that we're sampling from, have some risk of experiencing modern
slavery, then that risk might be zero. Okay, fine. So, but, but again, conceptually, I think
that's important. Okay. So one, don't know if that's correct or not, but that's where I'm,
that's one, that's where I started with. Okay. So then, so we've got the population, we've got
the target population. So now how are we sampling? So where is this data coming from? So this, we
sort of spent a few rounds and months on this, but I think it was productive, although perhaps not
what you wanted to hear or I wanted to hear or whatnot. But I think where we landed was, well,
look, what do we have? We have a convenient sample. We have an RDS sample, a respondent-driven
survey in which the respondents are members of the population. We're sampling from domestic workers
in the UK that have a cell phone, right? Yada, yada, yada. We're sampling from that population.
Initially, there are seeds and then we're doing an RDS with five coupons to,
to, to branch out, to do the, the RDS or the, the, the modified snowballs, not exactly snowballs,
whatever. Okay. Again, these are my beliefs. So please, right, correct me if, if, if, if I'm
wrong. Okay. So that's the data that we have to work with. So now the question is, what do we
do with that data? I want to add one additional aspect to the, the data, the, the sample I should
say, let me separate that from the data we're talking about in a second. In, in that functionally,
the sample, again, none of this is criticism whatsoever, but functionally, the sample comes from
three groups or we're sampling from three subgroups within the population of domestic
workers in the UK that have a cell phone. Those are people from the Philippines, maybe they're here
on a visa, maybe they just identify as Philippine, no, Filipina. Latinx, again, by self-identified
origin, ethnicity, I don't remember the exact wording and other, and, and British born. And
that one, British born, I think pretty sure is a, is a, is actually asked. I don't have the question
number on, on me. So if we wanted to, we could say, okay, well, look, there's really within this
here sample, there's three distinct clusters by say, nationality. I think we, I think we could
assert that with veracity. It's been a long few days and it's only Tuesday. I'm sorry. Okay. So
that these natural three subgroups or clusters, Latinx, Filipino a and, and British born, I think.
Okay. All right. So that's the sample. So then let me, we've got, I hope you're drinking a lot of tea
or coffee and pausing and or deleting this video. Okay. So then before I get to analysis, I want to do
a few data issues. So, so one, do we know anything about these sizes? So do we know anything about
estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK? So I found two websites once
one's official UK is nationalcareers.service.gov.uk job groups. So they sort of,
I'm guessing it's census based, but they're, they're these job groupings. And another is from
some organization in the UK called BICS. I've already forgotten what that stands for. But
it looks like there's some maybe a sense of the number of domestic workers in the UK. It depends
on how you count like these, you know, is this home cleaning? Is it daycare? Is it institutionalized?
Is it not? And like I said, this is just a very preliminary thing. Okay. So that's one numbers.
One A numbers. Well, actually, we could estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from
your very clever sample because of the RDS nature. So one of the questions in the survey is how many
other domestic workers do you know in the UK? And then ask for some, some recruitment information.
But just asking the how many. So basically what I'm saying is we're sampling from the population
of domestic workers in the UK. And one of the questions is how many other people in this
population do you know? So we can use that information to estimate the size of the population
where the population means domestic workers in the UK. Okay. So that's another that's I'm exploring
that currently as a possible additional source of information. By the way, that is using older,
I'm just saying this for the record. Sorry. So that's using sort of the the
uh, guile at all, but the early stuff. So 2010, 2011, uh, stuff that the stuff we'll talk about
in a second. The for analysis is a bit later 2014, 2015, a bit later. Okay. So what I'm saying is
the population, we can try and estimate the size of the number of domestic workers in the UK,
which might be of interest for a number of reasons. For me is of interest because we need that number
for later calculations and that can come from a few sources. I found two online, maybe they're
valid, maybe they're not. The third is we could try and estimate that from your survey. I'm working
on that currently, but it's giving weird answers. Like it's way too small and it's taking way too
long to run. So whatever, I'm just saying that for the record. Okay. Now I don't remember what number
we're up to. Analysis. Uh, so step one, let's just take it from the literature. Let's do the
guile at all. So this is the so-called SSPS. So this is the successive sampling population size
estimates. And uh, Krista Guile, who again, small world, we were neighbors at it in our postdoc at
doctor comes up with this very clever way of exploiting additional information within RDS
samples that essentially takes into account. What's really cool about it is that it uses
when, at which wave did you appear in the sample as an additional piece of information?
And the idea being that those with larger personal networks, so if I'm a seed and I give two recruits,
odds are those two recruits have bigger social networks than say the other people
that I didn't recruit. Basically, that's the idea and, and so on and so forth. Okay. So it uses this
idea, which overcomes it. It mitigates a lot of biases that were in so-called RDA1 and RDA2,
sorry, RDS1 and RDS2. I've also seen it called RDSA and RDSB volts, etc, etc, etc. So this SSPSC
seems to be, as far as I can tell, pretty, pretty state of the art. Okay. So we can just take that
from the literature. We can do estimation. There's a few hiccups, but nothing that we can't overcome.
And we get proportions. We get proportions of the population, which currently we don't know the
size of, but we can come up with some sensible ways of estimating it that are experiencing,
that are in the hidden population, that are experiencing modern slavery, however defined,
via Q36 or Q80, both dichotomized, which again, to my mind, are very sort of high bars. Like,
if you're saying yes to either Q36 or Q80, again, dichotomized, like, there's very good,
if you're answering honestly, there's very, very good reasons to think that
you're a member of the hidden population, that you're a domestic worker in the UK with a cell
phone, mobile phone, sorry, American, that is being exploited, that is, that is experiencing
modern slavery. Okay. So we can do that. And then there's, there's some sort of very, very recent,
most recent I found was the McLaughlin at all, 2023. I don't even know if I've sent it around.
Sorry if I haven't. That says, yeah, yeah, that's great. But essentially, the number of people that
I report, it's really clever. It says basically, the number, I might not know the number of people
that I know. And so the number of people that I report shouldn't be taken too literally. Essentially,
you should be taken, sort of what they do is they just add a measurement error components. They say,
yeah, well, you might not actually know, you might not truthfully report the number of people that
you know that, that are in your personal network, that are in our world, that are domestic workers
in the UK that have such and such characteristics. Okay, so we can do all that. And I have done,
done that. And, and the answer is really high proportions, something like 30 to 40%.
Depending on a few, you know, which question we use, priors, which model, etc, etc. But
pretty consistently 30 to 40%. Sorry, let me say differently.
And concurrent with the preliminary stuff I sent, whatever it was, months ago,
something like 30, 40% of domestic workers in the UK, if that's the population,
we are estimating to be experiencing modern slavery again, depending on how we're defining it.
It's one of these two dichotomous, dichotomous variables. And, and again, you know, those
caveats, however, I will say this, I was worried about a few things. Because when I first saw that,
I thought, wow, that's really high. I thought. So maybe there's some convergence issues,
doesn't look like it looks like the things have converged pretty well.

This is embarrassing, I got, this reminds me that when I was younger, my parents would
call me the voicemail and sometimes my dad especially would just ramble and the voicemail
would cut off, he would have expired the maximal amount.
I think that just happened to me, I've been rambling at you for more than the allotted
time that Microsoft is letting me and yet here I go again.
So I'll do my best to try and send along some kind of summary transcript.
I'm sorry, this is me trying desperately to stay current and catch up on research of which
this is literally the number one priority and you see it that I'm already falling behind.
So I'm really sorry about that.
Okay, right, blah, blah, blah.
Where were we?
So there are these estimates and they seem, I believe them more than I did when I first
sent the preliminaries around.
Now there's still stuff to do, there's still robustness, this, that and the other, but these
numbers seem pretty high.
Okay, again, 30 to 40%, something like that.
Now there's a few caveats here, well I need to say caveats, there's a few things I need
to say.
The first is, I should have said earlier, isn't about the analysis, it's about the data
and data cleaning, so one thing and much appreciation to Salim, he's done a ton of work, but one
is, and this turns out to be a bit of a subtle issue at least in political science, so one
is how do you deal with the don't knows?
So some of the questions, for example, one of the questions, one of our indicator questions
about are you in this hidden population, how are you experiencing modern slavery, is
about referral to the national referral mechanism.
And one of the response answers is, for I don't know.
So the issue is, how do you deal with those?
And those I don't know sort of pop up and obviously in lots of other questions.
Currently in Salim's formulation, they're being coded as in the negative, no I'm not
whatever the question is asking, something just happened, oh my god, I feel like I'm
like one of the worst colleagues, I'm so sorry.
So an alternative approach is to classify them as missing, so essentially you say, well
look, if a person reports, I don't know if I've been referred to the national referral
mechanism, we're just going to ignore you for purposes of analysis.
We're not going to count you as no I haven't been referred.
So doing that actually weirdly increases very slightly the estimates of domestic workers
in the UK experiencing modern slavery.
So Salim's descriptive statistics were, if you do what I'm suggesting, which is to
treat the don't knows differently from either an affirmative or a negative, you get ever
so slightly higher descriptive statistics, higher proportions just raw from the sample
data.
And it's something, you know, it's like 42 to 44, 42 to 43 or something like this, I
mean it's not, they're not huge.
That's one issue too, this one's a bit trickier, 17 out of 97 people in the sample report knowing
zero domestic workers in the UK.
So that one of the questions that, in fact the question, I should be more clear, I'm
sorry Caroline, I'll try and clean up in the transcript, in the summary of the transcript,
say I know zero people in the population, which we've defined to be, if I'm thinking
about this correctly, domestic workers in the UK.
Right.
Okay.
Okay, so maybe they do, maybe that's true or maybe they don't, but then in terms of
this data cleaning business, but then some of them make referrals.
So among the 17 that say I know zero domestic workers in the UK, there's another question
that says, please give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK that you know,
where no is defined properly per your survey, and they'll give a cell phone number or two.
Which again, this is like a logical inconsistency, if you report a referral, and a referral
must be a domestic worker in the UK, then you cannot know zero domestic workers in the
UK.
So there's a few people in the survey like that.
So those zero, essentially what I'm saying is those zeros should actually be something
positive.
We don't actually know, but a conservative answer would be turn those zeros into ones.
So I haven't done that, but it's a handful of people.
I can't imagine it's going to matter, but there's a larger issue which is what to do
with these zeros.
So if you claim that you know zero, if a person in the sample claims they know zero domestic
workers in the UK, and like I said, there's 17 or so out of 97, so it's not nothing.
What do we do with those?
And the reason I say that is because the estimators that I've been using essentially
can't handle the zeros.
And the reason for that I hadn't thought very deeply about, but I guess kind of makes sense
in the following way.
The estimators that we're dealing with just extensively rely on social network information.
And so if there's a person in your sample that says essentially I have, I don't have
a social network, zero, then that causes some problems because the entire estimation
strategy of these different techniques are to exploit, are to use whatever social network
there is.
But if that's zero, then something breaks.
And to be honest, I haven't worked through the math.
So what do we do with those?
We could remove them.
Turns out that doesn't really matter too much.
We could try other techniques.
I haven't fully explored that.
I've explored that a little, and I don't really know what to make of it.
Or we could just really add hawk, like just add one to everybody's reported degree.
So all the zeros turn into ones, all the fives turn into sixes.
That's not principled whatsoever.
But it's another approach.
Okay.
So that's data stuff.
All right.
Now, with regard to results, which again, I've completely misordered this and hopefully
it will be temporarily correct in the accompanying outline should I get around to producing it.
So this 30, 40% business that I mentioned earlier, like I said, I believe it more than
I did when I sent you the initial plumber results, which were relatively similar.
The little convergence results, so we have this estimate that's doing a lot of math.
And the idea is it comes up with lots and lots and lots of estimates.
But when all these estimates get very, very close to each other, the algorithm stops and
says, okay, here it is.
And so you can look and see, you know, does it actually do that?
And the answer is yes.
It converges.
Okay.
So I'm relatively, I'm more confident in the numbers on resolve that.
Okay.
So what am I, I'm sorry, I need to look at, right.
So the number one is just, do we believe these results?
I've checked convergence preliminarily, it looks pretty good.
We could do sensitivity analysis.
That would be on me.
I've done a little bit of that.
And again, it seems, in my opinion, surprisingly robust, like, I don't remember my discussion
about frequentist versus Bayesian, but the idea is you put some prior information into
this, into this, into this estimator, like, for example, how many domestic workers are
there in the UK?
What is the size of the population?
Now, we don't know that number, but we have some belief about it.
The beliefs I've been using are something like 1.74 million, say 2 million, whatever.
So you can change that number.
And the resulting estimates are very, very similar, again, in this 30, 40% range.
There are other techniques.
So the techniques I've been using all assume that the graph is connected.
So what that means is that if we were to know everybody's social network, which we don't,
but if we were to know all of it, it's connected.
So functioning with that means is that if there's a Ecuadorian in our sample, that truly,
if we had the entire social network of all domestic workers in the UK, which we don't,
if we did, there'd be some path for that there domestic worker from Ecuador to any other
person, any other domestic worker in the UK, in particular to the Filipino worker who might
be in our sample or might not, to the British born, the British national, whatever.
So truly, they're all connected.
Now, I think I mentioned this, but there's, I think there's some reasons to think that
might not be true, that there really, there might be clusters or subgroups here, primarily
around language, I would guess, again, this isn't, I'm not a subject of expert, but that's,
so that's fine.
There are techniques to deal with that.
So we could, and I haven't, but we could pretty straightforwardly deal with, well, maybe there's
a Filipino, Filipino, a network, and maybe there's a Spanish speaking network, or maybe
there's a UK born network, and maybe those are different.
Maybe they're not, maybe they're all connected.
But we could, one might say, well, I don't really think that they're all connected.
So that's fine.
We can deal with that.
I haven't, but, but, but we can.
Okay.
So that's one thing.
So disaggregate by origin.
We got that.
Yeah.
Like I said, it's, it's, in my opinion, shockingly high.
And so, you know, there's the whole, do we believe it?
Oh, and then, right.
Okay.
So then there's a, there's, there's an entirely separate, to my mind, this is a third sort
of approach or strata estimation strategy, which is so far everything I've talked about
is sort of off the shelf RDS.
It's very sophisticated and involves tweaks, like visibility and measurement error, yada,
yada, yada, yada, yada, but it's very, our sample is RDS.
And we're trying to estimate the size of some population slash hidden population slash members
of the population with some particular categorical attribute, et cetera, which again, perfectly
fine fits the data fantastically.
It's not at all what I thought we initially started this project with, which was some
variant of in summer or network scale up in particular, you're very, very cool and very
novel idea to use the generalized GN sum here.
So the question is, can we use the data that we have to do some kind of in some ish estimation?
And the reason I'm sort of pushing this or advocating for this is because I think it's
much more.
My guess is it's going to be much more powerful because in some is using more information.
And it's not just, it's not just counting the number of, well, how do I say this?
So in some is very, very powerful.
The issue is if you don't have a random sample, what do you do about that?
And the answer is lots of weird math that essentially boils down to the linchpin for
us is what's called inclusion probabilities.
So we don't have a random sample we acknowledge that that's fine.
So how, what statistical tricks can we do to the data that we have in sample so as to
be able to justify and use techniques that are meant for analysis of random samples like
in some.
Okay, so there's an answer to that and the answer is waiting.
And I think there's some really, really nice intersections here and really pretty straightforward.
I haven't implemented them, but essentially we can use, we can derive weights from these
RDS estimators and logic and packages and R to come up with these inclusion probabilities.
And again, we can do a few robustness whatever and then throw use those in the in some calculations.
I haven't done that, but I'm really excited to do that because I think my hunch is that's
going to be much more powerful in that it's just it's sort of taking the best, it's squeezing
all the information that at least I am aware of out of the data that we that we actually
have.
Okay, I've been rambling the combined with that.
So I haven't done that.
So, so me, Scott Moser to do bootstraps, I've done some, I haven't done all of them.
Since the analysis against some, not a bunch, this, this third way, this in some plus RDS
weights, I'm very excited about, haven't touched it, I haven't touched it practically.
I have thought about it and have notes, which are a mess.
Okay, next topic presentation.
What do we want to present?
And how do we want to present it?
Cables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian plus series, what?
I don't know.
And if I'm being perfectly honest with Caroline, I don't, you know, I'm not really right now,
I'm not in a huge position to sort of produce like publication ready graphics or what have
you.
But I think that's a discussion that would help me at least.
Okay, I think I'm about to get cut off again.
So I'm going to stop.
This is what I was hoping to report, discuss, talk about with you on Monday.
And like I said, I had early failed.
Hopefully this has some meaning.



## Voice 026_sdCE20231110.txt
I can't. I came on last Saturday. Okay.
Hello.
Good afternoon, everybody. How are you?
Good.
Hi. Good to see you.
And you.
Yeah, go ahead, please, Caroline. I'm not prepared.
Yeah, I was going to say, thank you for your email. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking.
It's just a way of trying to keep an aid memoir, isn't it?
Of where we're up to with this, really. So it was really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought.
Yeah, I think so.
We might have a path forward from what you're saying.
Yeah, honestly, that sounds really good.
I had to write everything down because I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that email.
Yeah. No, I'll keep talking while you're looking for it.
Please, thank you.
And interestingly, the Norck paper that you mentioned in it, I think that that is the first of two studies that they've done.
Okay. And we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I shared with you was the second study they've done a cohort study.
So now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional, but we've tried to track down both reports.
Small world, yeah.
But I think we know what they're publishing anyway, and that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the Gile, is it Gile?
Yeah.
But I will read that. And that will be useful for just putting the literature related to RDS together.
Yeah, I think so.
And Selim has done a fantastic job, I think, in actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started.
So I think we've made some pretty good progress this week.
Good.
So I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings.
Yes.
Like that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the email, Scott?
Or do you want to chat with them?
Chat about the risk assessment?
Yeah, if you don't mind, please do. I'm so sorry. Yeah, so sorry, please, please.
Now, we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then.
Right.
So what I tried to do, Selim, as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right, but there are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally.
And Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning weight so that overall they would add up to one.
That's effectively an index of no exploitation through to every form of exploitation we could think of.
And we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there may be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process.
But from what you're saying in your emails, Selim, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation.
Yeah, that's right. So I have gone through these steps that you have sent me in your email last Friday, and they all, 97 people, you know, so we have some level of exploitation.
And if you go to the Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night, you can see when you go to the column, some categories, so you can see that 0.366, 0.2, 0.1, and that continues.
And as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13 categories that we have asked our respondents.
Yeah, so the question that I had, and forgive me if I misunderstood this, but we, when we put the measures together, there were some that were sort of composite measures.
So there were the 13 sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement, where there were two or three together.
So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding, Selim, or have you just done a sort of all or nothing coding?
I've done all or nothing coding. So is this the, I mean, I didn't attend last week the meeting. Is this a complication then?
Well, this is, I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this input.
I mean, definitely, you've answered the first question was how many people in the sample experienced any form of exploitation and we know.
Because of the way we've selected organisations to approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation, and not just generic people working in the sector.
So that I think is good for our clarity of our method.
And I suppose the question is, could we, or do we want to, do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got?
Because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've designed the measures is just purely a cumulative sum.
But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub-totals almost.
I have a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run.
I'm sorry.
How you, how you sort of conceptualise the risk index?
First cup of coffee, so apologies to all, but I'm not exactly, so I see there's what 13 categories, is that right? Some number of categories.
13 categories, and saline's, for each person, saline's indicated the extent to which they fit in that category.
And the categories in the Word document are, oh I see, the categories aren't individual questions, they're compilations of questions.
Is that correct?
In some cases.
In some cases.
It's not always, we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have.
Okay, and then, so sorry, give me a second.
So Saline, how did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet?
So Caroline sent me the email, I think you have been also included in the same email, so I'm just, I think I'm just sharing it, this will solidify the communication.
Can you see that?
Yeah, that's exactly what I have, yeah.
Yeah, so I, so going back to the question, let's start here.
For example, this would be category one, yeah, category one, and we have our question, and for that question we have more answers in this survey.
We don't have only yes, always, often, or sometimes there's also no, never, and so on.
So, but as long as they answer one of these responses, they have been forced to do work against their will.
Right.
Back to the question.
And that will be done, weighted with 0.25.
Yeah.
What do you mean weighted by 0.25?
So it's like 0.25 times 0.025.
0.025.
So that's a proportion of the total index of one. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk, so that there was a sort of cumulative effect.
So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding, silly correctly, when you look at risk category one, silly, that was designed to be those two questions together.
Yeah.
And you see, because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability.
Yeah.
So that would give you a composite weighting.
So if you answered the first question, and in any of those responses, you get 0.25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further 0.25.
Just make 0.05.
Yeah.
Yeah, just what I have done.
Yeah.
So as Karen and I said, we have your two questions.
And if the respondent, our respondent has responded for both of these questions, then they will get a weighting for each 0.025.
And some of this would be, for this question, 0.05. And that continues.
So for all questions, so here, for example, would be, again, 0.05. Here we have, again, two questions.
So it will be 0.025, 0.025.
If they have been part of that indicator for exploitation, then they will get a weighting of 0.05.
And this goes back to the beginning.
So Caroline has let weighting for all our questions in a way that is first 0.35, 0.55.
And at the bottom is also 0.10.
So in total, this makes them one.
Yeah.
So that's what I sort of entered from our conversation last week, Scott.
Yeah.
That's what I creatively designed.
Gotcha.
Thank you.
I'm hoping that I've interpreted it properly.
Right.
And then, yes, and then the, I don't know what you want to cook.
So hang on.
So it's category one.
So I don't want to, I don't know how to describe this to the different.
So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't.
And I just want to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you, you've selected those weights, not 0.35 for category 13.
Yeah.
And you've done that on a qualitatively done on the basis of the extent to which you did indicate exploitation, serious exploitation.
So that we've got the middle block that saline's got on the screen where those are all indicators of forced labor risk.
And there's a sort of cumulative effect.
So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk.
And so I've allowed, there were about 11 of those indicators.
So it just made sense sort of mathematics or arithmetic lead to get a total of 0.55.
By assigning this, these smaller weights to each composite measure.
In addition to that, we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is a more objective measure of exploitation, because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that person is experiencing exploitation.
So we've only got one question on that.
But actually that's a stronger indicator because it applied. It's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that 0.35 on its own.
So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing exploit.
One, which is this, I wanted a point one.
So this is payment below the national living wage.
So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be, it could be a exploitation, but it isn't always.
So that's why I've waited at a lower level.
So I could make a narrative argument for why I put those weightings in.
But there's some convenience in making sure that they will add up to one.
Yeah.
But there is some sort of logic behind it.
Yeah, that's great.
So then just few more questions if I can.
So the.
So category 12 is this is like you were saying is like the suggestive, but not definitive indicator.
But it gets a weight of not point one, which is twice the weight of say, category 11.
Right.
So why that confuses me is if it's if if if category 12 is the loosest, wouldn't we down weight it relative to the other categories.
With the other indicator, it can be illegal.
I suppose this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially illegal exploitation.
That's true.
It's true.
Okay.
Whereas excessive overtime.
Yeah.
Not necessarily illegal.
Okay.
I agree it's arguable.
No, no, but I just, it's fine.
It's fine.
I'm understanding all the, all the, the, the not point fives and sorry, not point not fives.
Excuse me.
And so, so all the category, no, that's not true.
All the categories in the middle block get not point not five.
Yeah.
11 indicators of forced labor and for each indicator, it's not point 05.
And that's where the not point five five comes from is because you're okay.
Good.
And in category 13, it's, it's weighted, it stated it's weighted at not point three five,
but it's also stated it's weighted at not point four.
No, it is, isn't it?
That's true.
Which one of those is wrong?
So, which one did you use?
Did you use the point three five?
I've done that.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's a typo.
That's no problem.
That's no problem.
That's great.
Thank you.
So thank you.
So now I understand this.
So, so now, now I'm able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is,
if I'm understanding it, do you, do you want to combine categories?
Is that what you're, so for example, we have, um, go, sorry, sorry.
I think Salim's done it.
I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these
13 categories.
I'm right on time.
Salim, you have done it that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that's a good question.
The, the, the, yeah.
The indicators into those questions.
Good.
Okay.
And we're, I'm totally comfortable with that.
Is that as, do we need any other aggregation?
Sorry.
I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one?
Some category.
No, I'm happy with exactly, I'm happy with what you've done.
I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite
measures, but we do.
So that's perfect.
Good.
Okay.
I'm, I'm happy with that.
If you all are, I think that's, I think that's great.
Um, good, good.
So, and then for each of these, we get, there's some distribution of this
risk, which is great.
No problem.
Good.
Good.
And there's no, there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level.
Is there.
So, for example, combine categories.
That's what I understood your question to be Caroline.
But now I see, I, I'm mistaken.
That's not what you were saying.
So, sorry.
You mean if there was, um, evidence of low payment and forced labor and
NRM, I mean, we've got that in the summation, haven't we?
Yeah, you're right.
All the information's there.
You could just, you would just, if you wanted higher levels of
aggregation, you would just add up those categories on their own.
Yep.
Yep.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.
Got it.
That's good.
That's good.
Good.
Thank you.
Good game.
This is the data that we need.
And you have provided it.
So that's great.
Yeah.
In a week as well.
So thank you.
Well done.
I've done it.
I've done it.
Yeah.
It's, it's, it looks great.
Just like I said, this is totally spot on.
We're looking for.
I'm seeing.
Caroline.
I have to go back and correct.
I didn't weigh it was 0.35.
It's way.
It was 0.4.
these uh the sum category again by changing it to 0.35. Yeah I think so yeah sorry that's my mistake
I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't or I just have to change whatever is written
0.04 to 0.35 and then just take everything together this shouldn't take long. And it's only category
13 so it's yeah it shouldn't be it shouldn't be too bad. It will impact the sum category. Yeah that's
right category 13 in the sum that's right that's all excellent great good good good I still can't
find the email do you mind sharing your screen Caroline or or Celine or somebody to well I
might get more coffee sorry okay um
see if I can
share my screen
thanks
yeah we can see it can you see it yeah number seven okay um
um papers right good so we've talked about the papers and and thank you for the rds paper as well
I will read that that's cool right so I started playing around so one so the uh the trimming so um
yeah so uh boy how do I start I start by drinking more coffee um okay on on point one
there's there's something sneaky we can do there's a bit of a cheat so um
um so so in rds the usually what's done is your your sampling from the hidden population but
with convenience and snowball and all this jazz but everybody in your sample is is
is in the hidden population and the objective is to calculate the size it's a size estimation
so our setting is a little different but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of
tools in the rds toolkit and one of them is and I don't know why they they came up with this
because but it's per it's great for us is um is a proportion estimate so you could say okay here's
this here's this hidden populate so we're in the classical rds world which says everyone is in a
hidden population and you want to know something about uh covariate so for example um you want to
know the hiv status among iv drug users so iv drug users is your hidden population you can do an
rds but you want to know you want a proportion that are hiv positive say so the point is there's
some dichotomous variable that you can sample so for us it's are you exposed so here's take one take
one is there's some indicator or there's 12 indicators whatever um and we so what i'm trying
to say is is the the if we consider our popular hidden population to be the set of domestic workers
in the uk with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being have you zero one have are you
experiencing modern slavery yes or no again all the operationalization issues aside not with standing
but there's a way then off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in
our frame that have have this trait that are experiencing ms so why is that sneaky that sneak
so that's straightforward we can do but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number
it tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame that we think are experiencing this
so it's it's it's kind of a clever statistical trick where where in my opinion of statisticians
is that they take questions that you actually want to know the answer to and turn them into
questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're
interested in and i think i think this kind of fits in that category so um so i take it as good
news though like i said i mean one other sneaky thing we could do which is is different from us
than the rds world is we we have x we have based on other sources we have estimates i think of
like for example the size of domestic workers in the uk i think if so then we can do i mean
estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear but if so then we could i'm trying to say we could we could
we could we could force a number if we if we wanted to we can get a proportion using very
straightforward very proper methods if we have an estimate for the size of domestic workers in
the uk with a cell phone then we can we can we can gin up a size estimate so that's pretty cool i
think so that's that's that's one thing and that requires like i mean i could do that this afternoon
that get well yeah i could do that this afternoon requires very very little little little work i
mean like i said uncertainty estimates is going to be a bear but we'll have to figure that that
that's that now the risk uh actually i progressed since i wrote this email um so really i've been
describing it is there's there's like a zero one your your your hib positive where you're not but
turns out the the same methods actually apply for continuous variables so we can do exactly the same
thing with the risk uh uh uh index now here the news is not as good and a little bit treacherous um
so i was thinking about this what what's the quantity of interest here because so normally we
were we're going to know the size of section such but with the risk index is that we don't i don't
think and correct me if i'm wrong we don't care about like the total we don't want a number we don't
want like the sum of everyone's risk indices i don't think i think instead what we want is a
distribution we want to know in the population how is this risk distributed are there lots of
people with high value you know etc etc etc so that that would be ideally what we'd want
and i'm not aware of rds methods that will do that they'll give us numbers and confidence intervals
um so that's not great now here's the treacherous bit is um lots of these you're gonna hate me
so lots of these rds methods that have been playing with our our our Bayesian methods does that
mean anything anybody if not no problem not much i heard the term but i don't know that i
understand what it means absolutely no problem so so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the
statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistics so the idea there is you get
an estimate and you get a standard error or confidence interval or whatever you can do hypothesis
testing great go there's a whole other way of doing statistics called Bayesian in which um
um the Bayesians say um well so let me put it differently so in the frequencies world there is
truth there is some true size of this hidden population we just don't know it and our goal
is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great the Bayesians say
no there's no such thing as truth doesn't exist there's only belief and data and i the good
reverend bayes can tell you how you should adjust your beliefs in the presence of data okay so why
do i why am i prattling on about this i'm prattling on about this because in the Bayesian world what
you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing what you get out
is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions so what you get
out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval it's a shape it's a it's a
posterior distribution of the quantity of interest so in the in our world it would be not a size of
the hidden population it would be a distribution of how hard of our beliefs about the size of
of the hidden population does that make sense i'm thinking about it okay it's really weird i mean
it's a very they're two very very different ways of thinking about uh the world and learning from
data basically is it a sort of variability graph is that what you would produce what you would produce
is is a distribution saying for each value how likely how how confident are we the analyst
that the the size of the hidden population is 8500 there's some there's some belief there's some
probability that we have that the the size of the hidden population is 8500 people and there's some
belief or some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people that's some other
number and so on and so forth for every for everything okay so so why is it somewhat treacherous
this is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out a distribution when these rds
methods don't really produce distributions so the the treacherous bit is we if we use these Bayesian
methods to this rds risk thing what we would get out is a distribution but not a distribution
but not a distribution for the not not a distribution of the risk indices but a
distribution for our beliefs about the total the the sum of the risk indices
so that's what i'm saying it's a little treacherous like we it's a bit like before
we could force a distribution but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested
in it's like it's it's kind of like the difference between a distribution a sample distribution like
so you've got a bunch of x's and you can plot those or you could plot a sample means so take a
bunch of samples calculate a mean for each one and plot those so those are two distributions but
they're different they're not they're not and they both come from the variable x but they're
definitely not the same thing um and so so that's that's what i'm proposing is sort of a
it's like that it's very similar to the difference between that i just described um
so again i don't know if that's useful or not um i was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't
a there's one more paper i need to read to before i ruled out the but but i mean i think
i mean i think i i think i see what we need and and i don't i'm not aware of methods that
that do that because we want essentially we want we want a different feature of the network than
features of the network that people usually study right people usually study things like
maybe degree distribution but almost always yeah prevalence size what have you and we that's fine
but we want other features of of the network like uh the distribution of this continuous
covariate across across the network it's sort of like a one step removed like the mean is a
as a measure of the sample population exactly then the belief is a measure of confidence
i'm not really expressing it very well you got it exactly right you got it exactly right you got
exactly right and and so that's what exactly exactly and that's why it's treacherous because
we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want
but it kind of uses the variables whose distribution we do want to come up with this thing so
i don't really know it's like i said it's it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics and at the end
of the day i don't know how useful that would be but um let me write that down i do need one
there's one other paper i need to check um let's bear with me in that work distribution
and please correct me if i'm wrong if you if you either you know anything about uh
you know caroline last week he corrected me when i was and that was wonderful or two weeks ago
whatever it was but that was great so so uh hopefully um so anyway so so so point two is
kind of a mix i guess i don't really don't really know what to make of point two um and i don't
remember what i put it down as a possibility i think edward de bono has this idea of po doesn't
hear you and to me this seems like a po what's po po it's a it's a well i think about it as a
possibility it could be this could be possible but we we're sort of holding it up as a um a
possibility rather than a definite something that we know we can do so it's an opportunity
to engage in this pleasing discussion oh i see i see i understand i'm sorry i see yeah that's right
that's right um i don't remember what point three was if there was a point three i don't
i'm sorry i don't remember let me see if i can scroll down a bit further for you i'm hoping
that you can see my screen oh yeah it's perfect it's absolutely fine yeah thank you uh off the shelf
yeah um yeah there's there's software out there i've been playing with it again i've made some
i've made more progress since i wrote this uh email but they're yeah they keep
laptop yeah i keep crashing so i've had to switch a bit but i'm making some progress on that which is
which is um which is good oh right and then four right right so then so i'm i'm i'm i mean i think
we're solid on points uh one one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great but
then you know there's a sense in which this is all we've sort of strayed in a sense and this is not
a criticism of anybody this is not a criticism of anybody's data anybody's data gathering strategy
no no no no no sorry oh that was great yeah lovely friday apologies for that um um we we sort of
strayed in the following sense but we at least when i started working with you all which again is
awesome um we're working from the within the in some literature and trying to use g-sum and and
fian and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right it's just we're not the
techniques that we're describing here don't don't don't scale anything up um and that's kind of
unfortunate because we have all this we have this cool data and you know we have the possible
we could do scale up it's just we don't have this representative sample and that's so we're
worried about that um and it's especially bad because the those so normally uh non-random
sampling sort of how do i say this the usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty
estimates but but here that's not the case the the the the sampling uh the selection mechanism
affects not only the uncertainty estimates but actually the raw counts as well which kind of
makes sense because if you are picking people for who are if you're picking people who scale up to
bigger numbers and other people then okay that sort of makes sense that your your your your your
estimate of the count is going to be is going to be off okay right so what so what so i was thinking
like well okay we can do one two and three but we're sort of we're leaving yeah we've we've
straight from the flock from the we've straight from the initial and we're sort of we're leaving a lot
of juicy information on the table so is there is there any way that we can that we can do this and
this is where i had to start writing things down because i knew for a fact i would not at all remember
how to choose this but i i i think there's a way that um i i think we can i so sorry so what i'm
trying to say is um i think we can combine the two so i and i think i see how um again uncertainty
is going to be a real bear but the idea is basically you use the ideas from rds to to to
use the ideas of rds when doing the scale up to account for the non-random selection
and i tried to write down the details at least enough that would remind me of of where to go
in the in the future but it's it's it's basically taking equations from the
guile article and the fian and and sol sol and sort of gluing them together
and and praying so again sounds absolutely fantastic and we'll see um but yeah i think
i think it's worth trying circle in a way because this is what we were hoping that we would start
off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going no it won't work because this won't work because
this won't and now possibly there's a glimmer yep and i mean another nice i i think it's a
nice thing that you all might disagree is that what i'm proposing here is we'll get you know
oodles of estimates which i think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see
if is their consistency is their not is there because we will have all these different methods
you know to to throw at this problem and personally i think that's a i think it's informative
either way if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates that's
reassuring in a certain sense and if they don't that's informative that's telling you something
about about this so i think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without
detractors but i'm i'm i'm i think i think that's on balance i think that's good news so
that's my report which isn't really really exciting so that's fantastic if we think that
that we might be able to circle back to reinstate new sim using summer fian and to sell
yeah that's great that's that's the idea that's the idea yeah i mean i i yeah let me say i'll
try it out the um i'll try it out i'll try it out yeah um and i suppose our our ground our
foundation is that we can use the rds methods to get an estimator so estimator so even if this
yeah more advanced work doesn't reveal what we wanted to we've got a yeah when we're talking
about originally about that what we really wanted was some sort of estimate for this
and we feel that we can now achieve that yeah again with with the caveat which is
i don't know if it's good or bad but it's an important caveat that the thing that we're
estimating is a proportion and not a count yeah um yeah with that with that caveat we're solid
we're very very solid brilliant now i was reading a paper which was talking about this
difference between proportion and counts so um we can include that in the write up um and yeah
that's that's great i mean this i'm going to ask a really stupid question now but if we have a
proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size can we not produce a scale up
exactly we so that's right it's exactly so that we absolutely can't say what if we like if we
want a number we can produce a number um there's two here's a pro here's a con the pro is we're
bringing in outside information which i'm generally a fan of because you know one sample i mean
again there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better so if
there's other sources of of of data that we can incorporate that's great uh there's the pro the
con is um reflecting uncertainty in that world i'll have to think about um because
unless we had like a census count of domestic workers in the uk which i don't think we do then
then there's uncertainty in that estimate and i it's not immediately obvious to me how to combine
those two sources of uncertainty it's got to be possible i just have to sit down i'll have to
have another cup of coffee but yeah exactly if you if we if we if we want a number we can get a number
now we just be yeah it wouldn't be that
confidence is something yeah it would be tough to yeah it'll just be and we could just report that
i mean we could just say look here's here's the here's the estimate um there's two sources of
uncertainty we can't account for the one source of uncertainty and we can for the other and here's
it would just be a front of it and say you know or even more straightforward here's our point
estimate and because of data constraints we can't produce an uncertainty estimate sorry so like take
it or leave it you know um yeah yeah okay but the and you tell me caroline and from like a policy
perspective or impact perspective is i would think that a proportion would be i mean i know like
at least what i hear from people like cod and and what i understand from my home office is that
at the government level they they do want numbers they want counts but it i would think that a
proportion would be of abuse question mark yes i think so yeah definitely it's more than we've
got at the moment at the moment we've just got descriptive statistics so to have a proportion
is a real step forward that's great i can i will yeah i will get another couple i will do that this
afternoon uh that would be fantastic yeah that's really really good do you need anything more from
us scott yeah at this stage uh can you write my lecture slides for for next week please that's
the number one thing i need uh uh um seriously but that's uh no no well saline please just just
share when you get the category 13 thing fixed up which is i'm not worried about it's
trivial um just send it around again and i'll um i will do it after the meeting that's great that's
great and and shouldn't take long no it shouldn't and um i will uh yeah i'll do the i'll do the
proportion stuff this afternoon at least i'll i'll i'll try to and see uh see what comes out uh
and then i'm afraid i'm gonna have to park it again because teaching is gonna be horrible yeah
but i think we've really made some good progress here and i've got i've been looking forward in
my diary and i've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft up they i've been
making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using so i want to
consolidate that into a draft and i can share that with you that's a great idea so that'll be
a couple of weeks time i'm afraid but oh no no no that's no rush no rush on my end
time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way i think
we're in a position where we can start to do that i hope i'm not being overly optimistic but i think
i think it's very exciting i think it's quite promising really if i i mean i don't know this
literature as well as you all do but but it seems like there's a possibility to make a real contribution
i think um which is exciting so thanks for the opportunity it's good yeah very cool yeah really
good right well given that you've got lectures right i'm not proposing to detain you and yeah
any longer any longer than we have to and slim was there anything else from your side
that we needed to cover today uh this i mean there's just the category 13 yeah that i yeah
i'm sorry about that so i have to make a different mistake i have also more attention so i will just
dean up the category 13 and then uh recalculate the sound category and then share this
as opposed to you haven't yeah is there anything else that i can help with dr moulton let me i'm
just looking at the um right no as long as i've got the the node one the node two that that's
important no it looks like the uh what's weather exploitation you've mentioned in the email i'm
sorry whether that because we want to exclude respondents that have not been excluded exploited
oh this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some form of reverie okay thank you thank
you so they are all exploited gotcha something right which yeah and you got the waves and you got
the no yep nope oh well there is one other thing i think we've already covered it and that is what are
the if i'm gonna do that yeah there is one very important thing i think thank you for thank you
for that caroline um it doesn't have to be a single question in fact i think like a set would be great
which if i wanted to dichotomize and say yes you're in experiencing minor slavery no you're not
what questions plural would i what question should i use and and if there's one of the
one question that's fine which set of questions should i use there's the one like the n r m seems
like a pretty gold standard yeah that's good so the gut and the forced labor ones as well
are more indicative of forced uh of one slavery it's that last the point one one which is
elit potentially illegal exploitation but not necessarily labor not necessarily modern slavery
so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator they could be exploited it's labor
exploitation but it isn't it isn't modern slavery okay and that's q 36 5 b 1 uh and so i should use
that one and the n r m question mark yeah the n r m is definitely well as definitely as you can be
yeah yeah within our data modern slavery but combined with the forced labor increases the
confidence yeah good point and the two times to uh get anything else any other questions you think
i should be using for this indicator variable not that i don't think i've still aim if you've got
any anything you want to mention anything i'm looking at the document i i don't think so okay
great mix my life thank you that's great super duper okay thanks as up thanks uh as always everyone
yeah brilliant do you want to meet next week or give it a when do you want to catch up again
someone's at my door give me a second i'm so sorry yeah are you around next right
isn't it uh i for the next two weeks until the 22nd i might be not
rainbow because my annual review is coming up okay and i'm in the process of putting everything
together right okay now that's fine so it might be as well to have well if scott can circulate what he
does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again uh probably at the beginning
of december when is your annual review on the 28th 28th so the beginning of December 29 or 29th
of November any day after that right okay first of December since it's a Friday is that a Friday
yeah yeah let me find my calendar too sorry about that fire alarm business um
oh okay so we're suggesting scott perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work
this afternoon but then we don't actually meet again until the first of december that works
just if you don't mind sending me a team so invite that would be that would be great yeah
and 12 o'clock is that still a good time yeah i'm flexible so whatever if another time works
better for you all that's that's fine for me uh well 12 is all right for me what about you saloon
11 or 12 this time okay let's go for 11 and i'll circulate an invite and before that date i'll
circulate a draft so probably the week before whatever stage it's in i'll circulate it and then
that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well
great sounds great thanks everyone right good good to speak to you and you all have a nice
weekend yeah me too talk to you later have a good weekend and you thank you bye

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

And I came on last Saturday, OK. Hello, docomo. 

Speaker 3 

Hello, good afternoon everybody. How are you? 

Speaker 2 

Not. Hi, good to see you. 

Speaker 3 

And you. 

Speaker 2 

I would. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, go ahead, please. Caroline, I'm not prepared. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I was gonna say thank you for your e-mail. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking. It's just a way of trying to keep an aide memoir, isn't it? Of of where we're up to with this, really. So it's really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought. 

Speaker 

So. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. 

Speaker 2 

We might, we might have a path forward. From what you're saying. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, honestly. 

Speaker 2 

That sounds really good. 

Speaker 3 

I. I had to write everything down cause I knew I'd forget in the interim, and sure enough I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that e-mail. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No. And I keep talking while you're looking for it. So interestingly, the Nook paper that you mentioned in it, I think that there that is the first of two studies that they've done and we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I showed with you was the second study. 

Speaker 3 

Please. Thank you. OK. 

Speaker 

Ah. 

Speaker 2 

They should have done a cohorts study. And so now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional that we've managed to track down both. Reports small world, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

But. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think we know what we're where they're where they're publishing anyway and so that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the the guile. Is it guile? You pronounce her surname. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But I will read that and that will be useful for just putting the literature review related to RDS together. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. And then. 

Speaker 2 

Selim has done a fantastic job of thinking actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started. So I think we've made some, some pretty good progress this week. So I, I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings. So that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the e-mail, Scott? 

Speaker 

Good. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Would you want to chat with them? Chat about the risk assessment and everything? 

Speaker 3 

Still can't find it. Yeah, if you don't mind. Please do. I'm so sorry. I. Yeah, so sorry. Please. Please. 

Speaker 2 

Now we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then, right. So what I tried to do, slim as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right. But. There are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally, and Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning a weight so that overall they would add up to 1. So we had effectively an index of of. No exploitation through to in every form of exploitation we could think of. And and we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there might be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process. But from what you're saying in your e-mail system, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. So I have, I have gone through gone through these steps that you have sent me in your e-mail last Friday and they all 97 people. You know, so you have some level of exploitation and. If you go to the. Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night. You can see when you go to. The column some categories so you can see that 0.3660.20.1 and that continues so and as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13. Categories that we have asked our respondents. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So the question that I had and forgive me if I. Misunderstood this, but we when we put the the measures together, there was some that were sort of composite measures. So there, there would be thirteen sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement where there were two or three together. So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding slim or have you just? Done a a. Sort of. All or nothing coding. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it all on nothing coding, so is this the? I mean I didn't. I can't. Last week the the meeting that you had, it is it's just a complication then. 

Speaker 2 

Well, this is I. I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this we've got. I mean definitely you've answered the first question was that how many people in this sample we experienced any form of exploitation and we know. Because of the way we've selected organizations. To approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation and not just generic. People working in the sector. So that I think. Is good for our the clarity of our method. And and I suppose the question is, could we or do we want to do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got, because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've. Design the measures is it is just purely a cumulative sum. But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub. Totals almost. I suppose that's a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run. 

Speaker 3 

Little, I'm sorry. 

Speaker 2 

How how are you? No. How you how you sort of conceptualize the risk index? 

Speaker 3 

First cup of coffee, so apologies to all but I'm not exactly so I I see there's what 13 categories. Is that right? Some number of categories? Yeah, 13 categories and celines for each person. Celine indicated the extent to which they. Fit in that category and the categories in the Word document are. Oh, I see the the categories aren't individual questions, they're. Compilations of questions. Is that correct? 

Speaker 2 

In some cases. 

Speaker 3 

In some cases. 

Speaker 2 

It's not always we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And then? So so sorry. Give me a second. So so, so lean. How did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet? 

Speaker 1 

So Caroline sent me the e-mail. I I think you have been also including the same e-mail so. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I think I'm just sharing it this slit communication. Can you see? That, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's exactly what I have. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. So I. So going back to the question. Let's start here. For example, this would be category one, yeah? Yeah. Category one and we have our question. And for that question, we have more answers in this survey. We don't have only yes, always, often or sometimes. There's also no. But and and so on so, but as long as they answer one of these. Responses they have been forced to do work against their will and back. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

To the question. And that will be done. Weighted with 0.25. Yeah, and. 

Speaker 3 

What do you mean weighted by 0.2? So it's like 0.25 times. 

Speaker 1 

0.0250.02. 

Speaker 3 

2. 

Speaker 2 

Five. So that's the proportion of the total index of 1. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk so that there was a sort of cumulative effect. So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding silly correctly when you. Look at this category. One silly that was designed to be those two questions together. Yeah. Can you see because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability? Yeah. So. That would give you a composite weighting. So if you answered the first question and in any of those responses you get point nought, 25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further point. Nought, 25, do you use the maximum? 

Speaker 1 

And this makes 0.05. Yeah, yeah, this is what I have done. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's super. So. 

Speaker 1 

As Caroline said, you have your two questions and. If the respondent our ID, our respondent has. Responded for. Responded for both of these questions. Then they will get a waiting for each 0.025 sum this would be. For this question 0.05 and that continues. So for all questions. So for here for example would be again 0.05. Here we have again. Two questions. So it will be 0.0250.025 if they have been out of that. Indicator for exploitation. Then they will get the weighting of 0.05 and this goes back. Me. At the beginning so. Caroline has let waiting for all our questions in a way that pays 1st 0.35. Zero point. 55. And at the bottom. Is also 0.10 so. In total, this makes then one for 100% so percent. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So that's what I sort of interrupt from our conversation last week, Scott, that's what I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Creatively designed and hoping that I've interpreted it properly. 

Speaker 3 

Gotcha. Thank you. Right. And then yes and then the the I don't want. So hang on. So it's category one category. So I don't want, I don't know how to describe this. So the different. So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't and differs across and. Just to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you you've selected those weights, not .35 for for category 13 and you've done that on qualitatively done on the basis of. 

Speaker 2 

I have some. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

The extent to which. You. You. 

Speaker 2 

Which indicates exploitation, serious exploitation, so that we've got that the middle block that Celine's got on the screen where and those are all indications of forced labour risk. And there's a sort of cumulative effect. So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk. 

Speaker 3 

Right it it. 

Speaker 1 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 3 

Uh-huh. 

Speaker 2 

And so I've had allowed there were about eleven of those indicators. So it just made sense sort of mathematic arithmetically to to get a total of .55 those. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks for waiting, waiting. I think it's it. 

Speaker 2 

By assigning this these smaller weights to each composite measure, then in addition to. That we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is more objective measure of exploitation because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that, that person is experiencing expectation. So we've only got one question on that. 

Speaker 1 

M. 

Speaker 2 

It's actually that's a stronger indicator because it a flight, it's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that .35 on its own. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing explain. One which is this A which is at .1. So this is payment below the national living wage. So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be. It could be a exploitation, but it isn't always right. So that's why I've waited it at a lower level so I could make a a narrative argument for why I've I've put those weightings in, but there's some convenience in making sure that they all add up to one, but there is some sort of a logic behind it. 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. Yeah. No, that makes. Yeah, that's great. So then just a few more follow up questions if I can. So the the. So category 12 is this is like you're saying, is like the suggestive. But not definitive indicator, but it gets a weight of not .1. Which is twice the weight of say category 11. 

Speaker 2 

It is. 

Speaker 3 

Right. So. Why that confuses me is is if it's if if if if category the 12 is the. Loosest, wouldn't we? Down weight it relative to the other categories. 

Speaker 2 

And with the other indicator, it can be illegal. I suppose that this this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially an illegal exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. OK, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Whereas excessive overtime. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

It's not necessarily illegal, I I agree, it's arguable. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

No, no. But I just, it's fine. It's fine. I just want to. Make sure I'm understanding all the all the the. The not point fives and and sorry not point, not fives. Excuse me? And so so all the category. No, that's not true. All the categories in the middle block get not point not 5. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So there are 11 indicators of force labor and for each indicator, it's nought point nought, 5. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's where the not .55 comes from is because you're OK, good. Just one other question then in category 13. And. It's it's weighted, it's stated it's weighted at not .35, but it's also stated it's weighted at. Not .4. 

Speaker 2 

No, it is, isn't it? That's true. So one. 

Speaker 3 

Which? 

Speaker 2 

Of those is. Wrong. So then which one did you use? Did you use the .35? 

Speaker 1 

I've done that with 0.3. 

Speaker 2 

Five. Yeah. So that's that's in typo. 

Speaker 3 

OK, that's fine. That's fine. That's no problem. That's no problem. That's great. OK. No, no. So thank you. So now I understand this. So. 

Speaker 2 

My bad, OK. 

Speaker 3 

So now I'm able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is, if I'm understanding it, do you do you want to combine categories? Is that what you're so? For example, we have? No, I said. Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

I think kilian's done it. I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these 13 categories. I'm right, aren't I? Celine? You have done it that way. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

You can mind the questions the yeah, which is. 

Speaker 2 

The indicators into third question. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. And we're, I'm I'm totally comfortable. With that is that. Do we need any other aggregation? 

Speaker 1 

Some some category. Sorry. I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one the same category? 

Speaker 2 

Now I'm happy with exactly I'm I'm happy with what you've done. I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures, but we do. So that's perfect. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK, I'm. I'm I'm happy with that. If if you all are, I think that's I think that's great. Good, good. So and then for each of these we get, there's some distribution of this risk, which is great, no problem. Good. Good. And there's no there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level is is there so. So for example combined categories, that's what I understood your question to be, Caroline. But now I say I I'm mistaken, that's not what you were saying. So sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ah, OK. You mean if there was? Evidence of low payment and forced labour and NRN. I mean we've got that in the summation, haven't we? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just you would just if you wanted higher levels of validation you would just add up those categories on their own. Yep, Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good. Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it, so that's great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. In a week as well. So thank you, Celine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, well done. Well done. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it yesterday. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's it's it looks great. It's like. I said this. Is totally spot on. We're we're looking for. 

Speaker 1 

What I'm seeing, Carla, I have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. Its weight was 0.4, so I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.35. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Sorry, that's that's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't and obviously. 

Speaker 1 

I I'm saying so. Probably try. I just have. To change whatever is written 0.040.35. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then just. Take everything together. This shouldn't take long, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And it's only category 13, so it's it's. Yeah, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't. Be too bad. 

Speaker 1 

It will impact some category but it. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's right, category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great, good, good. I still can't find the e-mail. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to? I get more coffee, sorry. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 2 

See if I can. And my screen. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we can't see it. 

Speaker 2 

All right. Can you see? It, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

N7 OK, papers right. Good. 

Speaker 2 

So we talked about the papers and and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that. 

Speaker 3 

That's. That's cool, right? So I started playing around so one so the the trimming so. Yeah. So uh boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee. OK, on on .1. There's there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So uhm. So. So in RDS the usually what's done is you're you're sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz. But everybody and your sample is is. Is in the in population and the objective is to calculate the size. Is the size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit and one of them is. This, and I don't know why they came up with this because but it's it's great for us is is a proportion estimate. So you could say, OK, here's this here's this hidden populate. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population and you want to know something about covariant. So for example you wanna know the HIV status among. IV drug users. So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you wanna know you wanna know proportion that are HIV positive say so. The point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us it's are you exposed so to to take one take one is there's some indicator. Where there's 12 indicators, whatever. And we So what I'm trying to say is is the. If we consider our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being, have you 01 have? Are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside notwithstanding, but there's a way then. Off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have this trait that are experiencing mass. So why is that sneaky that sneaky? So that's straightforward. We can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame. That we think are experiencing this. So it's kind of clever statistical trick where it might my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually know the. Answer to and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in, and I think this kind of fits in that category. So, so I take it as good news though, like I said, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is different from us than the RDS world is we. We have ex. We have based on other sources, we have estimates I think. Of like for example the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think if so then we can do I mean estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear. But if so then we could. I'm trying to say is we could we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of. Domestic workers in the UK with the cell phone. Then we can we can. We can gin up a size estimate, so that's pretty cool. I think so. That's that's one thing. And that requires, like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon. Well, yeah, I could do that. This. Afternoon requires very little. Little. Little little work. I mean, like I said, uncertainty estimates is going to be a bare, but we'll have to figure out that now the risk actually progress since I wrote this e-mail. So really I've been describing it is there's there's like a 01 your, your your HIV positive or you're not. But it turns out that the same methods actually applies for continuous variables. So we can do exactly the same thing with the Risk Index now. Here the news is. Not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what's the quantity of interest here? Because so normally we were what we want to know the size of section size, but with the risk index, we don't, I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, we don't. Care about like the total. We don't want a number. We don't want, like the sum of everyone's risk indices. I don't think I think. Instead what we want is the distribution. We want to know in the population. How is this risk distributed? Are there lots of people if I value, etc. Etcetera. So that would be ideally what we'd want and I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that. They'll give us numbers and confidence intervals. So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is. Lots of these. You're gonna hate me. So lots of these RDS methods that I've been playing. With our our. Our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything to anybody if? Not no problem. Bayesian so. 

Speaker 2 

Not much. I heard the term, but I don't know that. 

Speaker 3 

I am absolutely no problem. So so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistic. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or conference interval or whatever you can do hypothesis testing. Great go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics like Bayesian in which. Bayesian, say. Well, so let me put it in. So in the frequentist world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population. We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great. The bayesians say no, there's no such thing as truth. Doesn't exist. There's only belief and data, and I the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should. Adjust your beliefs in the presence of data. OK, so why do I what am I addling on about this? I'm adding on about this because in the Bayesian world what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing. What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval. It's a shape. It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in in our world it would be not a size of the hidden population, it would be a distribution of how. Of our beliefs about the size of the hidden population. That makes sense. 

Speaker 2 

I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. 

Speaker 3 

OK. It's it's really weird. I mean it's a very there are two very, very different ways of thinking about. The world and learning from data, basically. 

Speaker 2 

So is it a sort of a variability graph? Is that what you would produce? 

Speaker 3 

What you would produce is is a distribution saying for each value, how likely. How confident are we the analyst. That the the size of the hidden population is 8500. There's some. There's some belief there's some probability that we have that the the size of hidden population is 8500 people, and there's some belief there's some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every for everything. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out of distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions, so the tractor split is we. If we use these Bayesian method. Leads to this RDS risk thing. What we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the not a distribution of the risk indices, but a distribution for our beliefs about the total. The sum of the risk indices. So it's saying a little treacherous, like it's a bit like before. We could force a distribution, but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in. It's like the it's kind of like the difference between a sample distribution. So you've got a bunch of X's and you can plot those or you could plot sample means. So take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two different distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not. And they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing. And so that's that's what I'm proposing is sort of. 

Speaker 2 

Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Is like. That is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not. I was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a there's one more paper I need to read to before I ruled out the the. But but I mean, I think it's, I mean I think I think I see what we need and and I don't I'm not aware of methods that that do that. We want essentially we want, we want a different feature of the network than features of the network that people usually study, right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always, yeah. Prevalence size, what have you and that's fine. But we want other features of the network like. The distribution of this continuous covariant across across the network. 

Speaker 2 

It's sort of like a one step removed, like the mean is as as a measure of the. Some or population. Then the belief is a measure of confidence and I'm not really expressing. 

Speaker 3 

Is that the? 

Speaker 2 

It very well. 

Speaker 3 

No, no, you got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. And so that's exactly exactly that's why it's treacherous. Cause we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses. The variables whose distribution we do want to come up with this thing so. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I don't really know. Like I said, it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics. And at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one. There's one other paper I need to check. Bear with me in network distribution. And please correct me if I'm wrong. If either you know anything about, you know Caroline, last week he corrected me when it was. And that was wonderful. Or two weeks ago, whatever it was. But that was great. So. So hopefully I'm. So anyway, so so so .2 is kind of a mix I guess. I don't really. I don't really know what to make of. .2 and I don't remember what point. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward de Bono has this idea of Poe, doesn't he? And to me, this seems like a Poe. Like Poe. It's a it's a. 

Speaker 3 

Wait, what's the code? 

Speaker 2 

Well, I I think about it as a a possibility. It could be it could be possible, but we we're sort of holding it up as a. A possibility rather than a definite something that we. Know we can do. So it's an opportunity to engage in this Bayesian discussion. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh I see, I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't remember. What .3 was, if there was a .3? I don't. Sorry, I don't remember. 

Speaker 2 

Let me see if I can Scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see my screen properly. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you. Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it again. I've made some. I've made more progress since I wrote this e-mail, but they're yeah, they keep. One of my laptop keeps crash. Yeah, keeps crashing. So I've I've had to switch a bit, but I'm I'm making some progress on that which is which is, which is good, right? And then four. Right, right. So then. 

Speaker 2 

I think. 

Speaker 3 

So I'm I'm I'm I'm. I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great. But then there's a sense in which this is we sort of strayed in a sense and this is not a criticism of anybody. This is not a. Criticism. Of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no. 

Speaker 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh that was great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, lovely. Friday. Apologies for that. We we sort. Of strayed in in the following sense, at least when I. Started working with you all, which again is awesome. We're working from. Within the in some literature and trying to use Gsom and Feehan and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right. The techniques that we're describing here don't scale anything up. And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data and we have the. We could do scale up. It's just we don't have this representative sample and that. So we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the so normally. Non random sampling sort of. How do I say this? The usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But but here that's not the case. The the the, the, the. Sampling. The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates, but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people. Or who? If you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers than other people, then OK, that sort of makes sense that your your your estimate of the count is gonna be is gonna be OK. Right. So what? So what? So I was thinking like, well, OK, we can do 1/2. And three, but we're sort. Of we're leaving. Yeah, we've, we've, we've straight from the flock. From the we're straight from the initial. And we're sort. Of we're leaving a lot of juicy information on the table, so is there. Is there any way that we can do this? And this is where. I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this, but I think there's a way that. I I think we can. So sorry. What I'm trying to say is. I think we can combine the two, so I and I think I see how. Again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear, but the idea is. Basically you use the ideas from RDS to. Use the ideas of RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection. And I tried to write down the details at least enough that would remind me of of of where to go in the future. But it's it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the. And and saw and sort of gluing them together and praying so again. 

Speaker 2 

For anyone else. That sounds absolutely fantastic and yeah. 

Speaker 3 

We'll see. But yeah, I think it's, I think it's worth trying. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, we sort of come full circle in a way. This is what we were hoping that we would try. We'd start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because this won't work because this won't be and now possibly. Yeah. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I mean another nice I I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree. Is that what I'm proposing here is we'll get oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because. You can sort. Of look across them and see is there consistency is there not is there. You have all these different methods to throw at this problem and. Personally, I think that's a I think it's informative either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates, that's reassuring in a certain sense. And if they don't, that's informative. That's telling you something about it about this. So I think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without detractors. But I'm. I'm. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I'm a I think I think that's. On balance, I think that's good news. So that's my report, which isn't. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really, really exciting. So that that's fantastic. If we think that that we might be able to circle back to real estate, Newsome using some of the and then to sell great. Yeah, that's great. 

Speaker 3 

That's that's the idea. That's the idea. I mean. Yeah, let's say I'll try it out the I'll try it out. I'll. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Try it out, yeah. And I suppose our. Our ground, our foundation, is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so. 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

Even if this yeah, more advanced work. Doesn't reveal what we want it to. We've got a when we're talking about originally about the what we really wanted was some sort of estimate of this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Again with with the caveat which. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it's an important caveat that the thing we're estimating is a proportion or not a count. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

But yeah, with that, with that caveat, we're we're solid. We're very, very solid. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Now I I was reading a paper which which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up. And and yeah, that's. That's great. I mean this. I'm gonna ask a really stupid question now. 

Speaker 3 

Nope. 

Speaker 2 

But if we have a proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size, can we not produce a scale up? 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. So that's right. Exactly. So we absolutely can we like if we if we want a number we can produce a number, there's two. Here's a pro. Here's a con. The Pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of. Cuz 1 sample. I mean again, there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better. So if there's other sources of data that we can incorporate, that's great. That's the pro the con is. Reflecting uncertainty in that world. I'll have to think about because. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Unless we had, like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 3 

Then there's uncertainty in that estimate, and I it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty. It's gotta be possible. I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee. But yeah, exactly. If if we if we want a number, we can get a number. 

Speaker 2 

No. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Now. 

Speaker 2 

We just be. Yeah, it wouldn't be that. 

Speaker 3 

Confidence is something. Yeah. It would be tough to it. It would just be and we could just report that. I mean, we could just say, look, here's here's the estimate. There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty. And we can't for the other. 

Speaker 2 

It could be that confidence in that number. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And here's it would just be upfront about it and say or even more straightforward. Here's our point estimate. And because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry. So take it or leave it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. But the and you tell me, Caroline, from, like, a policy perspective or impact perspective is I would say that a. Proportion would be. I mean, I know like at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from the Home Office is that. At the government level, they they do want numbers they want. Counts but it. I would say that a proportion would be of use question mark or. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so, yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The. Moment. At the moment we've just got descriptive statistics, so to have a proportion is a. Real step forward. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

That's great, I can. I. Will. Yeah, I will get another couple. I will do that this afternoon actually. 

Speaker 2 

That would be fantastic. That. No, that's really, really good. Do you need anything more from us, Scott, at this stage? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Yeah. Can you write my lecture slides for next week, please? That's the number one thing I need. Seriously with this. No. Well, just when you get to category 13 saying fixed up, which is I'm not worried about it. It's trivial. Just send it around again and I'll. 

Speaker 1 

I will. I will do it after the meeting. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. That's great. And and it shouldn't take long. No, it shouldn't. And I will. Yeah, yeah, I'll do the. I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon, at least I'll try to and see what comes out, and then I'm afraid we have to park it again because teaching is gonna be. Horrible. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, but I think we've really made some good progress here and I've got, I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft. Stop the. I've been making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using, so I want to consolidate that into the draft and I can share that with you. So that will be in a couple of weeks time and but I've got some time, but time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. That's a great idea. Oh, no, no, no, that's no rush. No rush on my end, please. 

Speaker 2 

We're in a position where we can start to do that. 

Speaker 3 

I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think. I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really, if I. I mean I I don't know this literature as well as they all do, but but it seems like. There's a possibility to make a real contribution, I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, very. Yeah, that is good. Yeah. Yeah, really good. 

Speaker 1 

Very cool. 

Speaker 2 

Right. Well, given that you've got exercises, I'm not proposing to detain. Yeah, you don't get any longer than we have to and slim with everything else from your side that we needed to cover. Today. 

Speaker 1 

I mean, there's just the categories that I've not done. I have to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that. My deliberate mistake. 

Speaker 1 

I I can also pay more attention to it, so I I will. Clean up the categories 13 and then recalculate the sum category and then share it with. Dispose of you and yeah. Is there anything else that I can help with? Doctor Moser? 

Speaker 3 

Let me I'm just looking at the. Right now, as long as I've got the node one and the node 2, that's important. Now it looks like the what's weather exploitation. You've mentioned a new e-mail type of. 

Speaker 1 

Whether they have been, but whether they have because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited by looking at that. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some fame, right? Right. OK, thank 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. It's that so they are all exploited some degree. 

Speaker 3 

You. Thank you. Got you. Right, which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got. The Yep. Nope. Bye. Ohh well there is one of them. I think we've already covered. It and that is what are the. It it if I'm gonna do that? Yeah, there is one. Very important thing. Thank you for. Thank you for that, Caroline. It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think book is set would be. Great, but which? If I wanted to dichotomize and say yes, you're in experiencing modern slavery. No, you're not. What questions? Plural, would I? What question should I use and and if there's more than one question, that's fine. Which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM. Seems like a pretty gold standard. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's good. So they got and the forced labour ones as well are more indicative of forced of once slavery. It's that last the point. 11 which is it potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labour? Not necessarily modern slavery, so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator, they they could be exploited. It's labour exploitation, but it isn't. It isn't modern slavery. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's Q 36 five B1? And so I should use that one and the NRM. Question mark. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the only one is definitely well, as definitely as you can be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Within our data, modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, good point. And the 2 * 2. Anything else? Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable? 

Speaker 2 

Not that I can think of. Still him. Have you got any anything you want to? Mention anything common? Use. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I I'm looking. At the document I I don't think so. 

Speaker 3 

OK, great. Good. Makes my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. OK. Thanks. Thanks as always everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, brilliant. Do you want to meet next week or give it? When do you want to catch up again? 

Speaker 3 

Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so. Sorry, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Are you around next Friday today? 

Speaker 1 

I for the next two weeks until the 22nd I might be not. Because my annual review is coming up OK, yeah, I'm. I'm in the process of putting everything together. 

Speaker 2 

Right, OK, now that's fine. So it would be as well to have well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again. 

Speaker 

My. 

Speaker 2 

Probably at the beginning of December, when is your annual review. 

Speaker 

I can't. 

Speaker 1 

On the 28. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

The 28th, so the beginning. Of December would be aware. 

Speaker 1 

29 or 29th of November. 

Speaker 2 

Any day off on that one, right. OK. 

Speaker 1 

3rd of December, since it's a Friday, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Is that a Friday again? Yeah. Let me find my calendar too. Fire alarm business. 

Speaker 3 

Sorry about that. Umm. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh OK, so we're suggesting Scott. Perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the 1st of December. 

Speaker 3 

That works just if you don't mind sending me a team invite. That would be that would be great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, and and 12:00, is that still a good time? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I'm flexible, so whatever. If another time works better for you all that's that's fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

That's alright for me. What about you, silly? 

Speaker 1 

11 or 12 is fine. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's go for 11:00. Then I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft. So we've got some probably in the week before whatever stage it's in. I'll circulate it and and then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on. 

Speaker 1 

No. Ohh good. 

Speaker 2 

That as well. Right. 

Speaker 3 

Sounds great. Thanks everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, good. Good to speak to you. Thank you. Getting fire alarm sorted out, OK. 

Speaker 3 

And. All have a nice weekend. Yeah, me too. Talk to you later and you. Thank you. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Have a good weekend. 

 

## Voice 029_sd20231208CESY.txt
Can you hear me excellent sorry I'm late I thought I slipped my mind at the coffee
shop and then popped up anyway sorry I'm late sorry sorry nice to see you all
how are you staying warm great how are you doing because you were I think you
had a doctor's appointment last week are you okay the health helps better thank
you yeah I'm cold but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it but
it's it's yeah I've been marking hell so how are how are you all yeah I'm doing
all right thank you yes I've been doing a little bit of teaching but just a
skills days for social policy social workers so yeah most of my teaching
takes place next term so I've got I'll be buried well I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm the
opposite so I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but enjoy enjoy while you can I
haven't touched anything since your last talk but if that said it's still
probably a good idea to touch base and see what's next or what's what what where
we are just so we don't sort of get off track thanks a ton for the draft I I
found the the sources and I give it a quick read but I haven't really done
anything I'm sorry yeah buried with teaching and grading so sorry no that's
okay I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it so it is it is a first
draft it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst
they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and
Celine might be able to contribute like sections of text so hopefully I'm not
asking you to put in anything that you're not not I'm able and willing to
contribute no that's of course thank you I missed that though can you what I don't
have it over and what so I mean obviously the the result the methods and
the results but yeah yeah so I've got some methodology down there but there's
obviously you're closer to the detail of what you're doing so yeah methodology and
results that's it and then yeah once we've got that in we can revisit the
discussion I put some points down but there will obviously be more coming out
when we've got the fuller paper to work with the other thing I'm aware that is
outstanding is you'd asked us if they were given the quite high proportion that
we're coming out with whether we could just look at some simple statistics to
see whether that proportion seemed sensible I'm wondering Celine have you
seen that email is that something you might be able to do for us you mean the
article no the Scots last email about taking just doing a sense check against
the proportion figure that he's finding no I didn't I told you just but also for
you Dr. Moses so I had in the last two through weeks my annual review the
preparation submission and also the exam that's why I didn't spend much time with
anything else but it went well so I passed the annual review good and yeah
so just update me quickly Caroline please so I'll forward you the email from
Scott because I've got it and then if you can just take it it's not a big job I
don't think but if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your
findings I mean Scots very kindly indicated which questions it relates to
so it's it's literally a percentage I think isn't it Scott yeah the issue is
just that so we've got these like fancy shmancy techniques which are great and
very preliminarily I and this was weeks ago I I
substance then and I know I had one cup of coffee today so this is all danger but
the sort of where I parked it mentally is we had some initial estimates using
these these sort of next-generation snowball samples for lack of a better
phrase and that is not a very good phrase and doing that gave some really
high at least it seemed to me really high numbers and so I was just thinking
allowed to Caroline and I welcome any and all inputs is just like what if we
don't do fancy shmancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the
proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern
slavery like what is that number I don't know what that number and whatever
that number is it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have a
random sample etc etc etc but just as a something to compare to the I don't
remember the exact numbers Caroline do you remember it was in the thousands
though what wasn't it in the well it was a proportion it was sort of 30% or
something yeah which just sounds really high I mean again it's the proportion
of my group of domestic workers who I think yeah possibly we can say even a
subset of those that are here that are from the Philippines or from Latin
America I think because that we're explicitly sampling that population
but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population yeah so yeah
and so that the percentage just seemed sound high to me but I don't know
anything about this so yeah it's possible yeah because they have no
protection yeah and and that's what I think it is possible I think it but I
think it and I think it would attract interest yeah so it would be good to
be sure as we can about what we're saying this this seems to be quite an
interest there's a lot of interest in this topic when Salim and I publish the
preliminary report just looking at the descriptive statistics we got a lot of
media attention for that so that was not really as exciting as what we're
doing here so I'm sure there would be continued interest from I mean there's
Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today he's sort of following our work and at the
rights lab he always keeps an eye on what press releases we create so he would
I'm sure pick it up again and yeah it is I mean from an impact point of view it's
it's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd
include ours in that but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has
produced a report but it's just descriptive statistics like us so this
really does move the conversation forward but that's great if there's no
say with the change of government if we presumably we get the change of
government then there's a task force which is charged with looking at this
issue within the first hundred days so it's potentially got policy impact so I
think some Andrea Rainer's leading something this that a colleague at
Nottingham Trent mentioned to me so this is the sort of thing that her team
would be interested in picking up as well so it could be really timely this
is bad I really want to be done with grading and get back to this this is
really exciting and that's what I was gonna say is that I wasn't aware of
these what there's word advocacy groups but I wasn't aware of sort of the
specificity that like you mentioned there's like a what was it Latin American
Women's you know and obviously you are connected to that but that's that
would be like you said that would be yeah I mean the more now we're having this
conversation and the once we start sort of sub-setting it down the the
proportion the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this
conversation so that's very exciting if true but okay there's a big caveat and
the big caveat there is so thank you Caroline again for the opportunity and I
completely agree with you that like if we can do some quanti stuff with this
yeah that would be you know the literature way better than I did but
like that's that's a contribution that makes me a little bit anxious because it
makes me think like okay well we really got to get these numbers right then
because you guys look at this isn't you know this isn't something that there's
sort of other it's like there's a pool of of this kind of quanti prevalence
estimation that we can sort of you know oh we're close or we're not so close so
different but here's why like it's pretty new so yeah but I mean yeah I agree and
when Bernard Silverman produced the stats the initial stats for modern
slavery in the UK he used multiple systems estimation to do that and he
produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by
policymakers which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end in that the
situation was far worse than his estimation suggested so I think you're
just talking to you're part of a conversation but the conversation keeps
evolving and the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that
are not correct but that are a way of engaging people in the debate so that's
as long as we're clear about what we've done how we've got to that I think we're
okay I think that's a really great perspective and not one that I had so
it's just a paraphrase you're saying like well I mean I mean essentially like
that's how science works is you you make some estimate you do some research and
then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed
or whatever and I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly
kind of like well gotta make sure this number is you know right for this method
is justified I think you're right that that's sort of not that's a luxury we
don't have in this particular research domain and that's just that's that's
that right that's that's that's not that's not a sin against us that's a nice
perspective I like that that's thank you for that Caroline yeah I mean I think
it's just listening to Bernard talk about his experience and yeah I mean I
think he said that the number of slaves between 11 and 13 thousand and then
later estimates suggested up to 148,000 right I just thought I mean yeah that was
quite a significant change in the number but his paper started that
conversation right and yeah so I think it's just viewing it as this is a
contribution to the debate based on these particular methods so when I get
time when I'm out of marking hell what's the what's the what's the next
step or help reorient me please as to what what I think it's trying to flesh
out that draft so I can go back to it and polish up what I've written and make
sure that it because it's not a bit less stream of consciousness but actually it
needs input from you and Salim as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's the
skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit once you've
had a chance to have a look at it it's got perhaps where you think we might
target it and whether it needs the sort of context setting to appeal to the
audience of the journal that we think we want to go for yeah good so okay thank
you that's helpful and I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my
mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in word and I
think you do understand latex don't you so it might be better actually to write
it in latex which I've never used but perhaps if we can get the draft up to a
certain standard you would be able to then transfer it for us yeah absolutely
that's fine actually and there's there's so back in the day you're right that
fact one of my early collaborators so I use latex and he didn't and we had this
project and he early on he was he was like we're never gonna publish this
because we just we're just gonna clash and so anyway I'm trying to say back in
the day that was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions it's
really straightforward to convert so we can we can still we can still we can
still talk to each other should be should be okay but yeah that's a good
point um Selene do you mind taking a step I don't know what what lit review in
terms of like the methods needs needs or is desired but do you feel comfortable
taking a stab at that so you know the basically I think I've sent along at
this point if you scroll the the the the patrol the trove of emails I've sent I
think there's and Caroline as well a number of papers that that address the
kinds of methods that we're using question mark so I I've written down
for now here the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the
methods section in the art field that Caroline sent and the second task is the
forwarded email so it seems there are some tasks I just had a glance into it
look into the email that Caroline just no forwarded and it asked them for you
Dr. Moseley you're asking for some information from my app so I will look
into that okay and what else is there the method section of the paper I've
already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies Selene so there
there is a method section there and then very sharp right it's okay I mean the
whole paper is 4,000 words currently I don't know quite what with we're
targeting what length we're targeting but I'm asked you specifically if you
could add the network structure graphic you remember that we put that actually
visualizes the structure of the network and and the way the extent to which it's
constructed of different waves okay so that was that section that yeah if you
could put that section in and then I've asked Scott if he could include the
point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated and
then the bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data
analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft because you know what
you've done so those areas are indicated in the paper I'll just put them in
they're indicated at the moment in just normal text I've just put them in bold
so you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier thank you that's great and
then obviously I can polish up the text but I don't want to spend too much time
doing that until results yeah until we know what the over whether it sort of
hangs together as a overall narrative yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I'll thank you
very much Caroline I see it it's it's I see what has to be done and I don't have
time to do it today yeah or what a weekend and also in the beginning of
next week so I'm I'm more free now great excellent is your time table get a bit
better in the new year then Scott is that yeah it gets better until about more I
have one of these intensive things and I plan to work so things will get a lot
better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research fiercely then but yeah for about
not quite a week but essentially the next week I'm yeah anyway it's I mean I see
what has to be done I can't wait to do it and and I'm so sorry but I simply can't
right now no no that's I mean I completely understand the teaching is
and something you can't ignore and and marking is just so many and the oh so
many so many so many yeah yeah I feel your pain well you be I'll sadly or why
don't know for better words so I'll I'll probably work over parts of the break
probably until late December and email and what I'm trying to say is I'll work on this
likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope
you're with your family I must admit my January is not too bad okay so if we can reconvene
perhaps in January does that suit you too Salim I could do online because or even in person
I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week but we could also meet online so
yeah online so would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've
got something to in the diary to work to yeah let's go so what ideally before the 15th of January
maybe yeah agreed would you want to pick it is Friday still going to be good for you Scott
I mean still teaching starts to be honest I don't even know my timetable for next
next term but the yeah Fridays should be should be fine um sort of I go to Salim before the
before the 15th but after the 4th would be good for me I think I'll I think I'll be traveling
until the 4th um uh so I don't know maybe try as the 12th yeah the 12th what's that like
sure yeah and does this time work much great for me a meeting of this time work
yeah it wants to be 11 a.m. again great good yeah let's put that in and then we'll see where we are
that's great that's that's that's a great deadline and that definitely gives me enough time to
that's great that's a great deadline for me thank you that's that's great and Salim if you just add
your section into the current document that's in the shared file then we've got one shared copy
that we're all working on that would be great we have done it before so yeah you'll sort of know
what we're doing with that so so is this oh yeah great so this is on the share uh the one drive
is that right yes okay it's not in the folder that you set up those but because I don't seem to have
access to put things in there but it is like it's on the one drive okay good the links in the email I
can resend it if you think that would be useful uh couldn't hurt you couldn't hurt uh I'm sure I'm
sure I have it but if you don't mind that would be great yeah thank you right let me see if I can
have you turn out or you don't worry about it I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder
so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it yeah we'll just see if I can find it
here we are here we go
right I've just really sent the email so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your
inbox now brilliant thanks a ton thanks a ton um oh good this is great so like I said I like that
this deadline um and now I must return to marking yeah and you might need more coffee I I absolutely
do so uh please please please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because uh that's vicariously
is the only way I will get to enjoy it so yeah so Dr. Moore I have been told by another academic
stuff when I told they told me during these two weeks of marking treat yourself eat the candies
eat the mass food or just to treat yourself from the marking marking strength that's great I will
thank you I'm that's great I'll I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well that's
thank you thank you thank you really great to see you all and and uh yeah I look forward to to
proceeding yeah yeah let's see if we can get something in the new year lovely good see you

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

Hello. Hi, can you hear me? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, we can hear you, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Excellent. Sorry I'm late. I slipped my mind. I was at the coffee shop and then popped up. Anyway, sorry I'm late. Sorry, nice to see you all. How are you? Staying warm, I hope. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, great. How are you doing? Cause you were, I think you had a doctor's appointment last week. Are you OK? 

Speaker 1 

Health better. Thank you. Yeah, I'm cold, but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it. But yeah, I've been marking hell. So how are you all? 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thank you. Yes. Been doing a little bit of teaching, but just a couple of skills days for social policy. Social workers. So yeah, most of my teaching takes place next term, so I've got. I'll be buried next in semester 2. 

Speaker 3 

I'm good. 

Speaker 1 

Excellent. Well, so yeah. I I'm I'm. I'm I'm I'm I'm the opposite. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but yes, enjoy. Enjoy while you can. I haven't touched anything since we last talked, but that said it's still probably a good idea to touch base and see. What's next or what's where? Where we are just so we don't sort of get off track. Thanks a ton for the draft, I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I found the the sources and I gave it a quick read, but I haven't really done anything. I'm sorry, I've just been buried with teaching and grading so sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's OK. I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it. So it is. It is a first draft, it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and Selim might be able to contribute like sections of text. So hopefully I'm not asking you to put in anything that you're not not able and willing to contribute. 

Speaker 1 

No. Yes, of course. Thank you. I missed that though. Can you? What? What? I don't have it open. What? So I mean, obviously the the result, the methods and the results, but yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. So I've got some methodology down there, but there's obviously you you're closer to the detail of what you're doing. So yeah, methodology and results, that's it. And then once we've got that in and we can revisit the discuss. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And I've put some points down, but there will obviously be more coming out when we've got a A for the paper to work with. The other thing I'm aware that is outstanding is you'd asked us if they're given the quite high proportion that we're coming out with, whether we could just look at some simple statistics to see whether. That proportion seemed sensible and wondering Selim, have you seen that e-mail? Is that something you might be able to do? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

For us, you mean the article? 

Speaker 2 

No, the Scott's last e-mail about taking, just doing a sense check against the proportion figure that he's finding. 

Speaker 3 

No, I didn't. I I told you just now. But also for you doctor model. So I had in the last 2-3 weeks my annual review, the preparation and also the exam. That's why I didn't time with anything else. But it went well. So I passed a new review and yeah, so just update me quickly. Caroline, please. 

Speaker 2 

So I'll forward you the e-mail from Scott cause I've got it and then if you can just take it. It's not a big job, I don't think. But if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your findings. I mean Scott's very kindly indicated which questions it relates to. So it's it's literally a, a percentage, I think isn't it's got. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, the issue is just that the so we've got these like fancy schmancy techniques which are great and very preliminarily, I, I and this was weeks ago, I I I. Sup. Since then and I only had One Cup of coffee today, so this is all danger. But the the sort of where? I. Parked it mentally is we have some initial estimates using these. These sort of next generation snowball samples, for lack of a better phrase, and that is not a very good phrase. And doing that gave some really high at least it seemed to me, really high in numbers and so. I was just thinking aloud to to to Caroline, and I'd welcome any and all inputs. Is is. Just as like, what if we don't do fancy smancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the the proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern slavery? Like what is that number? I don't know that number. And whatever that number is, it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have random sample etc etc etc. But just as a something to compare to. The I don't remember the exact numbers. Caroline do. Do you remember? It was. It was in the thousands, though, wasn't it in? 

Speaker 2 

The well, it was a proportion that you gave us, wasn't it was sort of 30% or something. 

Speaker 1 

Is it proportionate? That's right, that's right. Yeah, which just sounds really high. I mean, again, is the proportion of. Of my of domestic workers who I I think, yeah, plausibly we can say even a subset of those that are that are from the Philippines or from Latin America I think because that. We're not explicitly sampling that population, but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population. I think so. And so that the percentage just seemed to sound high to me, but I don't know anything about this, so. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Well, it's possible because they have no protection. And yeah, and and that's what I I think it is possible I think it, but I think it and I think it would attract interest. So it would be good to be as sure as we can about what we're saying because this seems to be quite a an interest. There's a lot of interest in this topic when. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Jim and I published the preliminary report just looking at the descriptive. Sticks. We got a lot of media attention for that. 

Speaker 1 

OK, that's great. 

Speaker 2 

So that was not really as exciting as what we're doing here. So I'm sure there would be continued interest from, I mean there's Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today, he's sort of following our work at the Rights lab. He always keeps an idea, an eye on what press releases we create. So he would. 

Speaker 1 

Nice. 

Speaker 2 

I'm sure pick it up again. That's great. Yeah, it is. I mean, from a an impact point of view, it's. It's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd include ours in that, but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has produced a report, but it's just descriptive statistics like us. So this really does move the conversation forward and I think. 

Speaker 

Ah. 

Speaker 1 

But that's great if there's if the. I'm sorry, you're. 

Speaker 2 

Good, now it says like with the change of government, if we presumably we get the change of government, then there there's a task force which is charged with looking at this issue within the first 100 days. So it's potentially got policy impact. So I think some Andrea Rain is leading something. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 2 

This that a colleague at Nottingham Trent mentioned to me, so this is the sort of thing that her team would be interested in picking up as well. So it could be really timely. 

Speaker 1 

This is bent. This I really want to be done with grading and get back to this. This is really exciting. And that's what I was gonna say is the the. I wasn't aware of these. We're advocacy groups. I wasn't aware of sort of the specificity that like you mentioned, there's like a what was a Latin American women's. You know, that's great if if we can can and obviously you are connected to that, but that's that would be like you said that would be, yeah, I mean the more now we're having conversation and the. 

Speaker 2 

When it's right started, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Once we start sort of subsetting it down the the the the proportion, the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this conversation, so that's very exciting. If OK, there's a big caveat. The big caveat there is. So thank you, Caroline again for the opportunity and I completely agree with you that like if we can do some quantity stuff with this, yeah, that would be, you know like way better than I did. But like that's that's a contribution. It makes you a little bit anxious because it makes me think like, OK, well, we really got to get these numbers right then because like this isn't, you know, this isn't something that. There's sort of other. It's like there's a a pool of of this kind of quantity prevalence estimation that we can sort of, you know, well we're close or we're not so close. So we differ. But here's why like it's. Pretty new so. 

Speaker 2 

Just. Yeah, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I agree. And when Bernard Silverman produced the stats, the initial stats for modern slavery in the UK, he used multiple systems estimation to do that. And he produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by policymakers. Which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end, in that the the the situation was far worse than his estimation suggested. So I think you're just talking, you're part of the conversation, but the conversation keeps evolving. Yeah. And the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that are not. Correct, but that are a way of engaging people in the debate. So I think as long as we're clear about what we've done, how we've got to that, I think we're OK. 

Speaker 1 

That's a really. I think that's thank you for that, Karen. That's a really great perspective and and not one that I. Had so. So just to paraphrase, you're saying. Like, well, I mean. I mean essentially like that's how science works is you, you make some mess and you do some research and then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed or whatever. And I I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly kind. Of like well. I gotta make sure this number is, you know, right or this method is really justified. And I think you're right, that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Sort of not. That's a luxury we don't have in this particular research domain, and that's just that's that's that, right? That's that's that's not. It's not a sin against us. That's a nice perspective. I like that. That's thank you for that, Caroline. That's a good one. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, I think it's just listening to Bernard talked about his experience and yeah, I mean, I think he said that the number of slaves were between 11 and 13,000 and then later estimates suggested up to 148,000. So I mean, that was quite a significant change in the number, but. 

Speaker 1 

Right. I just, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

His his paper started that conversation and yeah. So I think it's just viewing it as this is a contribution to the debate based on these particular methods. 

Speaker 1 

Right, right. Sounds good. OK, so when I get time when? When I'm out of marking hell. What's the what's the? What's the next step or help reorient me, please. As to. 

Speaker 2 

Revealed that. 

Speaker 1 

What? What? What I can do? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I think it's trying to flesh out that draft, so I'll I can go back to it and Polish up what I've written and make sure that it cause it's not a bit less stream of consciousness and but actually it needs input from you and Celine as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The the skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit. Once you've had a chance to have a look at, it's got perhaps where you think. We might target it and whether it needs. The the sort of context setting. To. 

Speaker 1 

Good point. 

Speaker 2 

To appeal to the audience, that's the journal that we think we want to go for. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Good. OK. Thank you. That's helpful. 

Speaker 2 

And I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in Word, and I think you you do understand latex, don't you? So it might be better actually to write it in latex, which I've never used. But perhaps if we can get the draft up to a certain standard, you would be able to then transfer it for us. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, absolutely. No, it's fine, actually. And there's there's. So back in the day. You're. Right, that in fact one of my early collab. Craters. So I use latex and he didn't and we had this project and he early on he was. He was like we're never gonna publish this because we just we're just gonna clash. And so anyway I'm trying to say back in the day there was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions. It's really pretty straightforward to convert. So we can. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, are they OK, good. So we could still. 

Speaker 1 

We can still, we can still we still talk to each other should be. 

Speaker 2 

Well. 

Speaker 1 

Should be OK. 

Speaker 2 

That's right. That's right. 

Speaker 1 

But yeah, that's a good point. Salem, do you mind taking a step? I don't know. What? What let review in terms of like the methods, needs, needs or is desired, but do you feel comfortable taking a stab at that so you know the? Basically, I think I've sent along at this point troll the troll, the trove of emails I've sent. I think there's A and Caroline as well. A number of papers that that address the kinds of methods that we're using, question mark. 

Speaker 3 

So I I have written down for now. And the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the methods section in the article that Caroline sent and the second task is the forwarded e-mail. So it seems there are some task I I just had a glance into it. Look into the e-mail that Caroline just now forwarded and then asked that. For you, Doctor Mose, you're asking for some information from my end, so I will look into that. And what else is there? 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the method section of the paper I've already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies. Yeah, so? OK, so there there is a method section there. And and then. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but it's gonna be very sharp, right? 

Speaker 2 

It's OK. I mean, the whole paper is 4000 words. Currently, I don't know quite what we're we're targeting, what length we're targeting, but I've asked you specifically if you could add the network structure graphic. You remember that we put that that actually visualizes the structure of the network. And and the way the extent to which it's constructed of different waves. So that was that section. That, yeah, if you could put that section in. And then I've asked, Scott, if he could include the point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated. And then. The bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Because you know what you've done? Not so. That's those those areas are indicated in the paper. I'll just put them in. They're indicated at the moment in just normal text. I've just put them in bold. So you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier. 

Speaker 

Thank you. That's great. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And then obviously I'll I can Polish up the text, but I I don't want to spend too much time. Doing that until. 

Speaker 1 

Results. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, until we know what the over, whether it sort of hangs together as an overall narrative, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

I'll. Thank you very much, Carolina. See it. It's it's. I see what has to be done and I don't have time to do it today. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, that's the big the big problem. 

Speaker 3 

Isn't it? I could do my part or what? The weekend, and also in in, in the beginning of next week. So I'm I'm more free. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Now, great. Excellent. 

Speaker 2 

Is your. Did your timetable get a bit better in the new year then Scott? Is that going to be, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it it gets. It gets better until about I have one of these intensive things and and I plan to work. So things will get a lot better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Fiercely then. But. Yeah, for about. Not quite a week, but essentially next week I'm. I'm yeah. Anyway, it's. I mean, I see what has to be done. I can't wait to do it. And and I'm so sorry, but I simply can't right now, right. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, that's, I mean, I completely understand the teaching is something you can't ignore. 

Speaker 1 

And and and marking is just so many and the oh so many, so many, so many. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. Yeah, I feel your pain. 

Speaker 1 

Will you be? I'll sadly, or I don't know. For better. So I'll. I'll probably work over parts of the break probably until late December and e-mail and what I'm trying to say is. I'll. I'll work on this likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope you're. With your families. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'll try not to, I must admit. But my January is not too bad. So if if we can. 

Speaker 1 

In June. OK. 

Speaker 2 

And reconvene, perhaps in January. Does that suit you too, Celine? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I could do online because or even in person, I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week, but we could also meet online, so there's no problem. Yeah, online or doesn't matter. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 

Me. 

Speaker 2 

So would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've got something to in the diary to work to? 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. Yeah, let's do so. Ideally before the 15th of January maybe. 

Speaker 2 

What? What? 

Speaker 1 

And then agreed. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Do you want to pick a is Friday still going to be? Good for you, Scott. 

Speaker 1 

I mean, until teaching start, I think I don't even know my timetable for next next term, but the yeah, Fridays should be should be fine. So I I do something before the before the 15th, but after the 4th would be good for me. I think I'll. I think I'll be traveling until the 4th. So I don't know maybe. 

Speaker 3 

Add the 12th Friday the 12th June. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the 12, what's that like? 

Speaker 1 

Sure. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. And does this time work? 

Speaker 1 

Looks great for me. 

Speaker 2 

This, this, this a meeting at this time work. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, it works for me. 11:00 AM again. 

Speaker 1 

Great, good. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, let's put that in and then we'll see where we are. I'll just do. 

Speaker 1 

That's it. That's great. That's that's that's a great deadline and that the plan gives me enough time to. That's great. That's a great deadline for me. Thank you. That's. Right. 

Speaker 2 

And still in if you just add your section into the current document and that's in the shared file, then we've got 1 shared copy that we're all working on. That would be great. 

Speaker 3 

We have done that before so should be fine. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. We sort of know what we're doing with. That so that's great. 

Speaker 1 

Oh yeah, since it's on the share or the OneDrive. Is that right? OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, it is. It's it's not in the folder that you set up those spots cause I don't seem to have access to put things in there, but it is it's. On the OneDrive. 

Speaker 1 

OK, good. 

Speaker 

Thanks. 

Speaker 2 

The links in the e-mail I can resend it if you think that would be useful. 

Speaker 1 

Couldn't hurt you. Couldn't hurt. I'm sure. I'm sure I have it. But if you don't mind, that would be great. Yeah. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, let me see if I can hunt it out. 

Speaker 1 

Or don't worry about it. I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we'll just see if I can find it. Here we are. OK. Right. I just resent the the e-mail, so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your inbox now. 

Speaker 1 

Brilliant. Thanks a ton. Thanks a ton. Oh, good. That's great. So like I said, I like this deadline. And now I must return to marking, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Smoking. Yes, and he might need more coffee. 

Speaker 1 

I absolutely do. So please, please, please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because vicariously is the only way I will. Get to enjoy it so. 

Speaker 3 

So, doctor, more than I have been told by another academic staff when I told, they told me during these two weeks of marking treaties. Now eat the candies, eat fast food, or just to treat yourself from the marking, marking stress. 

Speaker 1 

That's great. I I will thank you. That's great. I'll, I'll. I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well. That's. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Should do some fantastic. 

Speaker 2 

Guys, OK. Won't hold you anymore. Then stop. Good catch up. I'm glad you're feeling better. 

Speaker 1 

Really great to see you all and and and and. Yeah, I look forward to. Proceeding. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Let's see if we can get something in the new year. Good. See you. 

Speaker 3 

And then I see your. 

Speaker 1 

Bye. Happy holidays, everyone. Take care. Bye. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Thank you. Bye. Bye then. 

 

## Voice 038CE_DWeMSinUK-20240206_sd.txt
Hi everyone, I'm sorry I'm running late, the perpetual IT problems. How are you all doing?
It's good to see you. It just seems such a long time since we've met. I was saying to
Celine, have I seen you since Christmas and I haven't done what we met at the beginning of
December I think last time? That's right. Gosh, doesn't the time fly? It sure does. In fact,
I never know when it's too late to say this, but happy new year, happy 2024.
I hope it's off to a good start, but now even January is gone, so yeah, time really is flying,
but hopefully y'all are enjoying 2024 as it is. It's pretty busy. It seems that way.
So this is your heavy teaching term, is that right? Yeah, that's right. We were just talking
about teaching, weren't we? I'm still stuck with, I just can't, marking just never seems to end.
It's just forever. I know and eat cakes, which you are very kind to suggest to Celine, but
yeah, I just keep thinking like, okay, once I get this done, then I can do x or y and it
never ends, but anyway. I'm so, so glad we found time for this. Thank you so much everyone.
I confess, I haven't, I tried to prepare a little bit, but I don't exactly, thank you for your memo
or agenda, Caroline, let me pull it up. Yeah, I thought that just might help us sort of try
and cover off the main things that you discussed in your videos, which were great, by the way.
Really good idea to sort of capture it, capture your thinking about particular stage.
The honest truth is, I'm so bad at typing and spelling that I just figure my
healer recording is often just much more efficient. But thank you for taking the
time to be in and summarize. I think that's exactly right. What do you think?
I think it's great. I'm so pleased that you think we're still in with a shot with this
data. I think it's just fantastic what you're doing and whatever support I can give you,
and well, I can't speak for Celine, but let him speak for himself. But yeah, I think it's
really, really interesting how you're thinking about it, how you're conceptualizing the data
and these new approaches that you've suggested, I think it's fantastic.
It's all from, it's all thanks to you all. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be anywhere near
this project, we're not for you all. So thank you. So am I right in thinking about this though?
So the population are domestic workers in the UK, and then the hidden population are those
that are experiencing modern slavery. Pardon me one second, just realize my back leg. Give me one
second to not look like a monster. I'm sorry about that. I'm very sorry. And that the hidden
population are domestic workers in the UK that are experiencing modern slavery and we can catch
that out in one of three different ways, I think. So dichotomously, which again, I think, and
Carolyn, you get credit for this, the two questions I don't remember at the top of my head,
it was like 36 and 80 or something. They're very, in my opinion, they're very high bar.
And so I think that's great. And then there's this kind of risk index that we put together,
which could be like another. So help me out. So if we use this continuous risk index,
then isn't the population that we're sampling from or I guess what I'm trying to say is
are we making an assumption that everyone in the population is
has some degree to exposure of risk of experiencing modern slavery?
Yeah, this is interesting because the two indicators and I've picked up your question
number. So I hope they are correct. Selim will be able to check for us. But there are two
the way that exploitation is currently conceptualized is on a spectrum. And at one end, you have
minor infringements such as the national living wage, which would be the question 36. Are you
paid sufficiently? And then at the extreme exploitation end, you'd have modern slavery
question 80. So we've got two discreet markers on that scale. So I wouldn't equate
failure to pay the national living wage with modern slavery. I don't think we can say that
conceptually, but it is a form of exploitation and modern slavery is the most extreme form of
exploitation. And then so we've got those two that you've sort of very cleverly identified as
dichotomous variables, you're either a modern slave or you're not. And if you're either paid
illegally or you're not. And then we've got this risk index, which is a more the gray area in
between, which is the this composite variable. Does that help? Perfect. It helps a ton. No,
thank you for and this is again, this is why it's so awesome to work with you all. But
so I even my language was wrong. It's actually be thinking about exploitation. And modern slavery
is one extreme form of exploitation. But really, that there's this spectrum, and that that's
enormously helpful that that helps me in thinking about the. Yeah, okay, that's really great. So
then in that case, okay, so then the, the, the, the population is still domestic workers in the UK.
I'm just thinking aloud, sorry for that domestic workers in the UK. And then we're the hidden
population are exploited workers with then exploited domestic workers in the UK, where
that exploit measuring that exploitation, we do in three different ways. One is this sort of
minimal one is maximal and one is this, like you said, the gray area. I love that. I think that's
I didn't even, I didn't really, I didn't, Caroline, okay, good. Okay, so in that case, the, so, so,
so the, I guess one thing I can say, and I think I said the videos, I am surprised at how much more
confident I am in the estimates from way back when currently they seem, I'm willing to put my name
to them. I mean, they seem quite real. They're, they're, they're, in my opinion, they're shockingly
high. They're, they're very consistently depending on a bunch of model parameters, but sort of 30%
is a conservative estimate. So there's something like 30 to 40%. So, so the interpretation there is
again, depending on how we think about and measure exploitation, 30 to 40% of domestic
workers in the UK are experiencing some form of exploitation. And in fact, I can even tell you
the, the maximal one I was just looking at it is, so was it, it's question 80 is the, is the more
extreme one. Yeah, 30.7% is the estimate with a pretty reasonable estimate of uncertainty.
So I think this will make our message much more, it sort of tones it down a bit if we talk about
exploitation. If we talked about 30, 40% in modern slavery, that's very dramatic. Yes. And we'll be
a front page of the Guardian, which we don't necessarily want to be that dramatic. So I think
if we talk about labor exposition, it just tones it down slightly. And we're acknowledging that
modern slavery is an extreme form, but it's not the sole focus of the topic. So hopefully that
makes you feel a bit more comfortable about the size of the problem as well. It does. And, and
like I said, thank you. I'm so glad. And I don't know, I feel kind of foolish actually, because
like the more we talk, the more I realize, Oh, actually, I'm not, I haven't actually been thinking.
Anyway, so like this modern slavery versus exploitation business is, yeah, now these
results make a lot of sense. I mean, they're really, really high, but they're consistent. And if you,
so for example, if you look at the estimated proportion that are experiencing this extreme
form of slavery, it's 12% less than the estimated proportion of those experiencing the mildest form
of exploitation, which logically makes perfect sense. And the intervals makes some sense.
That's good. So that's sort of sanity. So I suppose that on what we, what I have done when I put
the composite together was mixed up these fair, the dichotomous and the continuous variable. So
we need to separate that out now, obviously. So we have another stab at that. So you, did you follow
that? The logic that Scott sent through about this difference between, because I've mixed up
labor exploitation, question 30, whatever it is, with the other risk indicators of forced labor,
I put it as a weighting at 0.3. And actually, we can't do that. Well, I can't do that.
Because it that'll affect the composite variable calculation. So it won't be accurate the way
I've currently specified it. I don't know which document or email you're referring to.
I know there's been the email video record from Dr. Mauser, and you have responded to it
just before this meeting. So you sent me an email before this meeting. Right. You know,
this was really sort of what came out of Scott's earlier. I can't remember when we discussed it.
Let me revise the composite measures and send those through to you. Well, send them through to
both of you, but particularly to Selim, because we'll need to recalculate those composite values
based on the understanding that we've mixed up a dichotomous variable with a continuous
risk indication variable. If you sent me the document or whatever, I should
just recalculate it. I can do that. No problem. Brilliant. I'm sorry it's extra work because
it means going back and redoing something that we'd already asked you to do. That's part of the
work. It's much clearer now. I think we're sort of learning as we go up. It's heuristic.
But so hang on, Caroline. I think I'm about to have a second mental breakthrough for the day.
So I understand the composite measure that we made is like this weighted sum of these various
indicators, but I missed why you think it... What's wrong with it? Because I've included
question 36, and I've given it a slightly heavier weighting, but I've included it
within the composite risk. I see. So I think I wasn't very happy when I did it, and I think
it's probably better if we split it out. And then we've got this clarity about
these two, the question 36 and the question 80, are clearly illegal activities, but at
different ends of the scale. And the other risk factors provide a composite picture,
which could be indicative of forced labour. It's much cleaner if we do it that way.
Okay. I think I see now. So it's not necessarily the case that... I think, again, thank you so
much. So I was originally thinking, okay, exploitation is on a spectrum. We have these
two kind of endpoints, question 36 and question 80, and that the composite measure would sort of be
in between these two endpoints. But if I'm understanding you, that's not really the
right way to think about it. We have... So, okay, that's one way to interpret. Here's a
second way to interpret. Yes, exploitation is on a continuum, and here we have indicators for the
endpoints. And then separately, we have this continuous indicator, which doesn't necessarily
fit in between these two endpoints. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but it's not the case that...
Does that make sense? It's not the case... Yeah, I think that's more accurate, it's separate.
I think it's separate. Again, thank you so much. Seriously, that was a second...
In the last 15 minutes, you've given me two... Okay, that's very helpful. And actually, that
will help me in interpreting the... I was a bit uncertain how to interpret the estimate of the
continuous indicator, but this discussion helps me a lot in understanding what those results are
saying relative to the dichotomous measures. So, thank you. So, that was clear to me from
your discussion about this difference between dichotomous variables and a continuous one.
So, I think if you're happy with that approach, I think that sort of moves this forward, although
it means redoing a bit of work. Perfect, and also just to be totally clear, I wasn't aware
that's what I was saying. So, really, you get credit for that, Caroline, completely. That's
really... No, no, that's awesome. Okay, so that's a huge clarification. I do have... And I don't want
to hijack the conversation at all. I have sort of a big, I guess, two medium-sized questions,
and then some really kind of obnoxious, small, but technical questions, if I may.
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. So, the... Okay, I guess maybe... Okay, let me do the small ones first.
So, right. So, the don't know is the data stuff is fine. There's one nagging data
issue that I still have, and it's this business about zeros. So, some people... I don't remember,
I think I said 17 or something, a handful of people report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK.
So, the reporting that their network size is zero. Now, some of these are clearly an error,
because then when it comes to the referral question, can you give us the cell phone of a
domestic worker in the UK? They provide one. So, some people who say, I know zero people in the
UK, then provide a cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK. So, clearly, those people are wrong.
So, I'm comfortable sort of finding them and turning their zeros into at least one. Again,
that's conservative, because we know that they've reported at least one. So, one... Okay, so that's
one issue. And then two, there's still some extra zeros. Some people who say, no, I know zero people
in... Sorry, I know zero domestic workers in the UK, and I've reported zero. And I don't exactly
know why, but those zeros are messing up the estimators. The estimators can't handle... I'm
guessing it's like a divide by zero problem or something like that, where... So, the question is,
what to do with the true zeros? Two options. One is we just sort of
gin it up and say, let's just add one for everybody, which isn't really...
I mean, it solves a problem technically, but it's really, really sketchy. Or two,
remove the true zeros. So, what to do with the true zeros is one question. And then the easier
question is, what do we think about turning the wrong zeros into ones? Are we comfortable with
that? Again, we're talking about a handful of people, but with a sample size of 97,
a handful of people is not true. So, does that make sense? The two questions make sense?
Are my... Yes, no, it does make sense. I mean, I'm tempted to say, take them out. I don't know what
that does to the... That seems... Because anything else is a fudge, isn't it? Exactly, exactly. So,
what I have been doing is just adding one to everybody and just saying... But I completely
agree with you that what it does is it does increase our uncertainty. And I think it increases it
a bit. I don't remember exactly, but I agree with you that that's the most principled. Are we okay
turning the zeros into ones for people who do the nominate or make a referral? Or should we...
Are we turning them into the number that they nominate? Yeah, exactly. So, if they nominated
two people, we turn them into twos. And then one, if they nominate one, is that how we're doing it?
Exactly. That's how we could do it, which I... Yeah, we can do it. I'm comfortable with that
myself if you all are. Yeah, I think if we take out the ones that are through zeros,
I don't know what the implications of that has for how we're sampling. But I mean, if we just say
that's what we've done, it's a limitation of the estimating technique, really, isn't it?
Yes, that's right. It's not a data limitation. It's not a data limitation. It's an estimation.
You're 100% right. Yeah, it's a limitation of the estimation. That's right. Sorry.
Yeah, so I think we can probably just say that.
So it's... And so we've got two things that we're doing then. So we're taking out
the true... The ones that really are zeros. And for the ones that do nominate,
we're then increasing their... We're correcting the data. Yes, exactly.
To reflect that they do know...
They do have other people in there. They do have other domestic workers in their networks.
Yes, exactly. And I think that's conservative. But I have to say, what I mean is I think...
What we're doing is we're saying, well, we don't know this person's degree size. We know that it's an
error. And so we're assigning it a value that's the smallest possible size it could be. If you've
nominated two people, given two cell phone numbers, we know that you know at least two...
Maybe you know more that you just haven't nominated. So by changing the zero to a two in that case,
I think what we're doing is we're underestimating that person's network size, which I think is
conservative. What I mean is I think that won't inflate our estimates. I think. I should double
check that though. But if it's... I'm almost sure it is. But anyway, that should be my homework.
But if so, then I think that's perfectly fine. Because we're kind of shooting ourselves in
the foot really. So whatever we find is gonna be... Yeah, I think it's gonna be fine. So
because the degree size... Yeah. So there's sort of two-part solutions to that problem.
So we take out the true ones, and then we
modify the data to reflect the actual sample size for the others.
Those both sound reasonable to me. Selim, does that sound okay?
I have the similar suggestion that you have made. Based on the number or the amount of people they
have provided the phone numbers. So we could take the amount of the phone numbers they have provided,
although they have reported in the earlier question that they don't know any other domestic
workers in the UK. So modifying it should make it consistent with the other existing
survey findings. Good. Excellent. Great. Thank you. Okay. Now that's what that is. Excellent.
So, let's see. In increasing order of easiness.
Yeah. Increasing order of easiness. Okay, I'll save this. So what do we want to see? But that's at
the end. Domestic worker size. So I went back and double-checked, and it's true.
The thing that we're estimating is a proportion. But to do that, one of the inputs... So we have
this R data, and we have a bunch of parameters, and all that's great. One of the inputs that's
required for the estimators that I'm currently using, not for the INSOM estimator, but for the
RDS estimators, is a guess, is a prior belief on the size of the population that we're sampling from.
So what that means is, ideally, we would know how many domestic workers there are in the UK
with a cell phone. So we know the number, the size of the population that we're sampling from.
And of course, not necessarily the number of those experiencing exploitation.
This doesn't have to be a hard and fast number. It can be like, well, here's my best guess,
or here's a ranger, or whatever, whatever. But we need that number. And I've been looking,
I thought it would be easy to find a labor statistic site or something. And I haven't come
up with a great number, or one that I'm super happy with. My best guess is something like 1.7 million,
which sounds a bit high. But then again, there's a lot of people in the UK. Anyway,
so if you have suggestions on where to get reliable information on the number of domestic
workers in the UK in the period that you all were sampling, that would be great.
What I've been doing is just making up numbers. And I've been making up numbers and increasing
them by orders of magnitude. So suppose there's 10,000. Suppose there's 100,000. Suppose there's
a million, and seeing how, just as a very crude way to see how those inputs affect the outputs.
And the good news is they seem to affect the outputs not very much. So this is great news,
actually. This means our estimates are relatively insensitive to the prior knowledge, namely the
number of domestic workers in the UK. That said, at some point, we'll need to settle on a number
that we'll use. And of course, we'll say see appendix for robustness. But for the stuff that
we report, I'll need a number. Does anyone have any thoughts on where to find information on that?
Well, the only thing that we've suggested in the past, which may not be very helpful,
is the overseas domestic worker visa numbers. Because that is a fixed statistic that
ought to relate to how many visas for a six month period, because they last for six months,
and then they expire, and people have to go home, in theory. And I can't remember off the top of
my head what that number was, but I think it was around 76,000. It sounds about right. Yeah, yeah.
So if we, I mean, that's my best stab at an official statistic. I don't know if you've come
across anything. We have adopted to the most recent publishing from, I think it was also in
Guardian, and it also referred Guardian of Times, that news article, and it also referred to the
Government UK page. So they regularly published that. So yeah, it was about 70 or 80,000, I think.
So I don't know how satisfactory that is. I haven't, I'm not familiar with the web pages
you mentioned that you looked at. So if it's possible to send me the link, I could have a look
and see if I can, if that sort of turns into any more robust ideas. But at the moment,
the only thing I can suggest, which doesn't help us for the non British, sorry, for the British
Nationals, but. Yeah, a bit. I mean, it's fine. The good news is like the quality of results are
really, really robust, again, surprisingly robust. So, you know, we can see, here's a number that we
can use and we can give a site to and say, clearly, this is an underestimate. Again, C appendix B for
sensitivity analysis. Yeah, I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm perfectly fine with that because the
results are again, qualitatively are really consistent. So I'm fine with that. So, so no,
thank you for that. Thank you for that. Okay, I've got two more on one, what at least one I think
is a bit is a bit tricky. So I've been as to so I you can identify three groups, three subgroups
here, at least I'm sure you all could probably identify more. Those by ethnicity, so those coming
from the Philippines. Those are easy to identify. Those that come from some Spanish speaking countries,
like Bolivia, Colombia, but also Spain, and UK nationals who aren't one of these who aren't in the
first two categories. The question is, do we want to do anything with that information in the
following sense? In fact, Caroline, you suggested we could perform estimation separately, like
completely separately, like, like, just use this group data, just use this data, just use this
data and get three different sets. The UK people, I mean, it's really small. So the main interest
is on the, now, so for the Philippines, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I wanted to get your thoughts
on, well, so the general question is, do we want to do anything with that information? Here are
some things we could do. Split them up into three groups, perform analyses separately, but especially
between the two non-UK national groups. Question mark. If so, how comfortable are we group, the
Philippine one, the Philippine group subgroup seems pretty very straightforward, very justified to me.
Are we okay lumping Ecuadorians with Bolivians with Spanish, you know, sort of putting all
Spanish people coming from Spanish speaking countries together? When I say together, I mean in
the same subgroup, to which we will perform our estimation. What do you think?
I don't know what sensitivities we might be, and the thing that comes to mind is Burt,
if I'm not Burt, and his class, have you ever read a paper by Cyril Burt about,
it's highly controversial, racist science, and actually he lumped people together and measured
their brain size and then concluded that people in certain racial groups had smaller brains.
I remember this, yeah. And there's been a huge critique, obviously, of this paper,
and it was depicted as racist science because of the assumptions that he made when he grouped
people. And I don't know what the sensitivities are about grouping Ecuadorians and Spanish people
into some sort of larger category. And I don't know whether that any, if we did that it would,
I don't know either. Stand the test of time, or whether we might be called out in the future for
some sort of atrocity that we don't even know we're committing. Okay. So I don't know about that.
I want, is there value in doing the Filipino grouping to me as far as I can predict sounds safer?
Yeah. And is it, does it show any distinction, any distinct differences from taking the,
I don't know. I tell you to take your point. Thank you. It's a very good, I hadn't even thought
about the sort of test of time aspect. That's a really, really good point. My one reason for
doing, my reason for doing this is twofold. One is just very, very technical because the
estimators that I'm using have this underlying assumption that truly in the world the social
network is connected, which means that there's some path between the Ecuadorian in our sample
and the Filipino in our sample. Somebody, this person knows somebody who knows somebody who
knows somebody who knows this person. Fine. We don't have to make that assumption,
but it makes my life a lot easier. I think there's reasons to challenge that assumption,
namely by language, for example, you might think that this, that a group of
Philippine domestic workers are, are separate, are separated from
maybe, and maybe that's the racist of me to say in the first place, but
I'm not suggesting we're being racist. I'm just using that as an example, but I think
Bert did when he realized he was making a racist assumption when he did it. I think we just have
to be careful that we might not understand the assumptions we're making. I think that's
right. So what I'm hearing from you is maybe just don't subgroup. Well, the second reason I was,
I raised this, I wanted to separate this is because, because of these, in my opinion,
relatively large estimated proportions, I was curious about heterogeneity, right? Like where,
where are these big numbers coming from, basically? So that was sort of a more substantive
motivation. And to answer your question, Caroline, I don't know. I haven't actually performed,
I haven't done the estimation by subgroup. So I don't even know if there's anything interesting
there. So maybe I should do that first. This might be moot, I guess is,
I don't know the answer to your question. But what I'm hearing is like, play it safe and don't,
maybe it's not such a good idea. Maybe we just leave, we leave the analysis at the,
using the entire sample all at once and just state the assumptions and move on.
I don't know. It's tempting. It's tempting to have a look at it. I mean, particularly for me,
for the Filipino group, because we've got quite a large, two thirds of the group is Filipino. So
could we somehow test the distinction between the Filipino group and the broader sample?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
That strikes me as being a sort of safe test. Initially, dip our toe in the water
with hopefully out and not offending anybody by, by means that we know that we don't understand.
And like I said, that's actually, on my end, that's a much easier data task,
because identifying that subgroup is just easier.
Nicely, clearly delineated.
Yeah. So thank you. I'll do that and include that in my next, like I said, I haven't,
I just haven't done that analysis. But yeah, I'll do that. Okay, that sounds great.
Okay, so the last hard question is, what do we want to present? What do you want me to make tables?
Do you want me to make pictures? Do you want me to make p values? Like what, what do we want to,
from the results, what do we want to show? And how do we want to show it? I don't know if I'm
being clear. I'm probably being overly vague, aren't I? So we'll have.
Thank you. No, I think it's a really, really reasonable question. It's just one I don't think
that I know the answer to. So I suppose it's tied into where we think this might be publishable.
And how technical a journal that is, and whether it's a journal that would
require that sort of technical detail, or if we were publishing in a more lay journal,
for want of a better way of putting it, whether that would be a turn off because they just,
it depends, I suppose, who's going to review it? And what are they going to expect to see?
Because we talked about various journal articles, sorry, journal at which we talked
about the Journal of Modern Slavery, where I'm sure that I don't think it would be going,
well, I may not be right, then it might be going to statistical experts
in whatever technique we finally land on. So, because there is quite a lot of
prevalence estimation within the modern slavery literature, so there will be people who do have
statistical understanding. But I think you'd also mentioned was it POS, PLS? And really,
I don't know anything about what their readership would expect. They're pretty technical. So modern
slavery you're saying is a pretty technical, or at least they have technical competences?
Well, I think there is increasing interest in prevalence within the modern slavery literature.
There are recognised practitioners, I'm thinking of Clifford Zines at Nork,
they do a lot of prevalence estimation, they work in the modern slavery field,
so I would say if you're suggesting reviewers, it's that research group that potentially
I'd identify as being a potential reviewer. No, I'm taking notes, thank you. Okay, so
to make my life easy, it sounds like I'll start with just text, you know, point estimates,
confidence intervals, whatever. Personally, I'm very, very visual, so I think pictures are
easier to interpret for me than words, but it's also more work on my part. So it sounds like
I'll start with point estimates, confidence intervals, so the plain James, so to speak,
but vanilla I should say, ways of presentation, and then we can tweak from if we need to,
when we get closer to submission. Is that what I'm hearing? Is that sound right?
Yeah, I think I don't think I can add anything particularly helpful
to this conversation, other than just trying to tailor it to whatever outlet we go for.
Yeah, I do like diagrams, and I think Celine's already added a sort of representation of the
network. So something along those lines really helps to make the hard statistics more understandable.
So yeah, I agree with you that diagrams have great explanatory power.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, okay, I'll, good, but that's not good. So I'll sort of, well,
I'll start and then, like I said, we can revisit this when we get closer to submission, but just,
no, that's helpful for me, that's very, very helpful for me. I think those are all my questions.
Let me double check, please. Oh, and you're right, I do, I haven't, there's this third
protractor, I'm getting increasingly excited by or about that I haven't done, which is this
combining the RDS with the, yeah, your 0.7, Caroline, exactly. Everything I've done and
we've talked about is very off the shelf, which is fine. I'm not at all, I mean, these are,
this is absolutely proper, but there is this, initially way back when I started talking about
this, you had this very cool idea to do in some estimation and talked and thought and Scott
thought some more and read some more and confused himself and, but yeah, there is,
there definitely is this way to combine the two. I haven't done it, it will be manual, but I'm,
I'm very excited by it, about it, mainly for the comparison, because, you know, all of these RDS
techniques are giving relatively the same, you know, 30, 40% depending on XYZ, whatever.
But there are all this class of estimators are all giving similar, but in my opinion,
really high estimates and really curious to see how this sort of, you know, this outsider,
this outsider in some method would, would, would compare. It's also cool because there's
a sense in which it's, it's, it's using more information that you already have in your sample,
which I think is, I'm always a huge fan of, of that, you know, using all the data that you can.
So I haven't done that. I don't know what your thoughts on, like, is that,
should I make that a priority? Is that, is the, is the RDS enough? Do you have any thoughts?
It sounds really exciting. I mean, it's, you've got the time to do it, but she's always,
we don't, we never have time to do anything. But if you want, if you find there is time,
then it sounds really exciting and really interesting. And that is where we started
this journey, trying to work out how to do nuisance. So to try and, if we, if we can,
if our data can say anything along those lines, that would be really exciting.
Yeah, I agree. And even if I'm, again, it depends on where we're going, but it's,
it's not like the Journal of the American Statistical Association. I mean, it's not,
what I'm trying to say is there is a, there is a methodological innovation here. It's not
huge. It's sort of taking this paper and taking this paper and recognizing that
they have the same D and I can use that, I can put them together. But I haven't seen it done.
And I think it's, I think it's a very cool idea to, to, to combine these two. And like,
like you said, Gerlain, like since, since, I mean, the information's there, it's sitting in our
Excel file, right? Like, why not? Okay. So if we're going to do that then, I might ask one
piece of help from Celine or whoever. And that's to code up the bootstrapping
procedure. So I can do the estimator, but we'll need to estimate the uncertainty.
And we know how to do that. It's with the paper that actually you
summarize and included, Gerlain, and your bootstrapping doc.
But we'll have to, we'll have to write that up in R. Can you do that,
Celine? Or is that not something you're comfortable with?
I can start looking into it.
Okay. That'd be great.
And then I will update you.
Wonderful. The,
Oh, that's a song.
I'll email you both with the, let me make notes here, bootstrap.
It, there's a lot already written. You've got a good head start in that, like, there's,
the paper is pretty readable. They have some supplementary information. They have some R code
already. So you, you're not starting from scratch, but it would, you will need,
well, we will need at some point to implement this for this particular method.
It would be a big help to me if I could do the estimation part and you could work on the
bootstrap part and then poof, and then press publish.
Can you, can you shout this paper again?
Yeah, absolutely. I'll share the paper and the, the supplemental information.
There is bootstrap. I'm just making notes to myself, but yeah, that's absolutely fine.
And I'm glad to hear that you're excited about the insum too,
Caroline. That, that's invigorating. That's, that, that, that, that helps, that helps me.
I like, I like that.
Yeah, that sounds really good.
I think, I think there's one thing we have missed from your,
from that list and your video. I don't think we've talked about number two,
which was,
Yes.
How, how we, how we've dealt with the don't knows in the data at the moment.
Good point.
And we perhaps need to, to code them slightly differently.
Perhaps as missing. I think that was your suggestion.
Yes. And so I've, I, and please do not take any offense whatsoever.
Slim, your, your, your, your recoding is, is absolutely, you know, invaluable.
But I did change it a little bit in that, I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think you had been coding.
So, so, so the issue is there's, there's, there's these different categories that one can answer,
of course. And almost always one of the answers is don't know or not,
don't prefer, prefer not to say or what have you.
And slim, you had been coding those replies as an absence of exploitation, however measured
in whatever type of exploitation. And I've recoded those as just missing.
So you just take those observations out. Again, that's a bit conservative because that,
because by, wait, is it? No, it's anti-conservative. So the absence of, yeah. So, right, my bad.
That's anti-conservative because by removing the, by taking, okay, two options. People who say
don't know are not experiencing exploitation. People who say don't know are not in our analysis.
Here's Salim's initial way. Here's what I, what I'm suggesting. Now that I'm thinking about it,
I think my suggested way is, is, is anti-conservative because
relatively speaking, it'll look like there's more people in exploitation
using my method than Salim's method. Hmm. Interesting. Caroline, thanks for bringing
this up. I had, I missed this. Yes. So the question is, what do we want to do with the
don't knows? That's exactly right. Okay. I'm just following what you're saying about
if you take them out. I think that's right. And it makes things look
worse. Yeah, worse, worse, worse, right, right. I think that's right. Because they had been coded
as not experiencing exploitation. Exactly. Yeah, which is not really what we want to do. I suppose
by nature, I would be more conservative.
So we don't want, given that we've already got 30 to 40 percent of the population.
Yeah. We don't want to make it, make it look even worse. Yeah. So we could say that. We could say,
we're, here's what we're calling the don't knows. And by the way, that's conservative because
yeah, we're, because really we're making a judgment call. We just as easily could say, well,
no, actually the don't knows are experiencing exploitation. I mean, it's arbitrary, right?
Like how, how, how, so in, in putting it in the not experiencing
exploitation, counting them as not experiencing exploitation. Yeah, I agree with you, Caroline.
It's, it's making our, yeah, it's conservative because then our estimated proportion of those
experiencing, yeah, the estimate proportion would be small. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. My apologies,
Celine. I did, I, you had it right all along. My bad. My bad. No, it's really useful clarification
that so we could, and we just sort of being clear about what we're doing, but it's good that we
don't have to recode it. So yeah, no, that's great. I think we're airing on the side of caution. So
that seems to me the right way to, to be airing. Agreed. Brilliant. Thank you. I've been trying
to type up what we've agreed just on the same email. The only one I haven't got anything against
is six. What did we say? Oh, the six is just a statement, really.
You would just, the current method you've been using for analysis and what it does.
Yeah. So I finally sort of wrapped my head around these RDS math, sort of in, in, in a way that I
should have ages ago. And I sort of, I see what they're all, they're all, they're all doing the
same thing. And they're all just making a little bit of adjustments differently. And so what I'm
thinking of doing is saying, you know, when we review the literature, like, okay, here's,
here's all these various RDS methods. And yeah, they all have different assumptions.
And we're going to do all of them, but in the appendix. And here's the one that we're going to
pick to present, because in fact, actually the one, I found one even better than the SS,
RDS, or RDSSS, called the Model Assisted, I like it better at least. But the point is we have all
these sort of related methods, these RDS methods. And my thinking is to just pick one for presentation
in the main text, and then say, you know, see appendix, whatever, for, for comparison. And
the, the estimates really are quite different. And, but again, for us, the numbers are virtually
identical, weirdly. So, yeah, I know, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that means something
about robustness, I think. That's my, that's not rigorous, but that's sort of my, my thinking is
that, or it could mean something else. And it could mean that that whole debate in the prevalence
literature is, is wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles, you know, is, is doesn't really matter. It could,
it could mean that the differences in the assumptions and the way that the different weights
are calculated doesn't really matter very much is what it could mean. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.
But regarding point six, is that, is that, are we cool with me simply picking one for
presentation purposes? And then, you know, here's the Boltzmann-Hoff estimator, and here's the
Geil SS estimator, and here's the model assisted estimator, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
or, or should we, or alternatively, I guess we could just pick one and just justify it as
strongly as, as we can. I don't know. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah. I think we have to
have a reason for picking the one that we picked, but that's up to us. I'm happy to be guided by you
on that. That's very polite and very clever of you. They think that's very good, Caroline.
Well, the reason I'm, I'm a little bit hemming and hawing is that there's, there's basically two
that I think are sort of the clear. Yeah, exactly. And, and I don't really have a strong preference
on either. So that's, that's more homework for me, I suppose. The
Yeah. Yeah. Well, the homework bit is the justification, right? And like, I've got to pick
one. And so, right, so two are easy to justify with one of the two. I mean, again, at the end
of the day, subjectively doesn't, it's not going to matter because the all, but, but you're 100%
right. Like we got to pick one to use in the main text to show the results of, you know,
to do the bootstraps for them, whatever. So that's a, yeah, that's, that's,
all right. That's on me. That's on me. Very good. Very good. Thank you for bringing that up, Caroline.
Again, thank you for bringing that up. It's just brought up really great points. So thanks.
Right. I think we're there. Brilliant. It's really exciting. This is a lovely conversation to have
on a Friday. We should do it more often. I'd love to. Yeah.
Is it sensible to try and put a provisional meeting date in the diary, just in case
it keeps us sort of at least talking about when we can meet, even if we find nearer to the time
that we can't. And our Friday is generally okay for everybody. I can generally do a Friday.
Selim, you're nodding. Scott, this afternoon. It would have to be
definitely after one, likely. So this time is fine. Two is totally fine. But yeah, Friday after one.
So if I pop another date in a month's time,
or sooner, sooner, yeah. Okay. Then sort of three weeks, two weeks.
Selim, how much time do you have to, okay. Yeah. Anything's good for me. Well,
once I finish marking, anything's good with me, which should happen this weekend. So,
yeah, I'll have time this term. So whenever, it's fine for me.
All right, Selim, what did you say? Two or three weeks, which one would you like?
The 16th of February. Okay. Again, two p.m. or before noon, or before noon time.
It's okay. Two p.m. Yeah. Yeah. Let's put that in and we'll see what happens when we get there.
And we can always jiggle it about a bit if we need to. But yeah, that's super.
So for my tasks, before we end the conversation, I will do that coding up for the bootstrapping.
And Dr. Moser, you said you would share that paper with me and some information for what I should do
and how I do it. And Caroline, you mentioned earlier something about checking or rechecking
the composite measures. Yes. Yeah, recalculating the composite measure. I'll send you a one
page of what I think now ought to be in it. Okay, this will be helpful. Yeah. So I'll try and do
that as soon as I can, which probably means I have to try and do it this afternoon. And then we'll,
yeah. And then, yeah, if you can just recalculate a risk variable two, if we keep the original,
but we'll try another column with a revised composite and then we haven't lost anything.
But I think at the moment it's wrong as it stands for how we're conceptualizing the data.
Brilliant. Thanks, everyone. It's really nice to see you all and happy 2024. So all right,
we'll email and talk soon. Yeah, I'll send out the points of the note that I made so we've all
got a copy. Brilliant. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
Thank you.

Speaker 1 

Hi everyone, sorry running late all the perpetual. It problems. How are you all doing happy? 

Speaker 2 

It's good to see you. Yes, we're just catching up with it. Just seems such a long time since we've met. I was saying to Celine my have I seen you since Christmas and I haven't done what we met at the beginning of December. I think last time Dash doesn't the time fly. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. I it sure does, and in fact I I never know when it's too late to say this, but happy, happy New Year. Happy 2024. 

Speaker 3 

Happy New Year all. 

Speaker 1 

Hope it's hope it's off to a good start, but now even January is gone. So yeah, time really is flying. But hopefully you all are are enjoying enjoying 2024 as it is. 

Speaker 2 

It's pretty busy. 

Speaker 1 

It seems that way this is so. This is your heavy teaching term. Is that right? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's right. We were just talking about teaching workloads. 

Speaker 1 

I'm I'm still stuck with. I can't. I just can't. Marking just never seems to end. It's just. 

Speaker 2 

It's just, it's just forever. 

Speaker 3 

You just need to do it. 

Speaker 1 

I I know and and and eat. Cakes which you. Were very kind to suggest to cilium, but uh yeah, I just. I keep thinking like, you know, OK, once I once I get this done then I can once I get this done then I can do you know X or Y. And it. Never ends, but anyway I'm. I'm so so glad for. We found time for this. Thank you so much, everyone. I confess I haven't. I tried to prepare a little bit, but I don't exactly thank you for your memo or agenda. Uh, Caroline the let me pull it up the. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I thought that just might help us sort of try and cover off the main things that you discussed in your videos, which were great by the way, really good idea to to sort of capture it. 

Speaker 1 

Took the time. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Capture your thinking at that particular stage. 

Speaker 1 

The the the the honest truth is I'm so bad at typing and spelling that I just figure making the recording is often just much more efficient. So, but thank you for taking the time to get and summarize. I think that's that's exactly right. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

I think it's great. I think it. I'm so pleased that you you think we're still in with a shot with this data. I think it's just fantastic what you're what you're doing and and whatever support I can give you and well I can't speak to slim but and and let him speak for himself. But yeah, I think it's really really interesting what. That how you're thinking about it, how you're conceptualizing the data and these new approaches that you've suggested, I think it's fantastic. 

Speaker 1 

It's it's all from. It's all thanks to you all. I mean, I wouldn't I. I wouldn't be anywhere near this project were it not for, not for you all. So, so, so no, thank you. So am I right in thinking about this that I mean, so the population are domestic workers in the UK and then the hidden population are those that are experiencing modern slavery. Probably once you just realized my backlog. Give me one second. Not look like a monster. I'm sorry about. Very sorry and that the the hidden population are domestic workers in the UK that are experiencing modern slavery, and we can catch that out in one of three different ways. I think. So dichotomously, which again I think and Caroline, you get credit for this. The two questions I don't remember top of my head was like 36 and 80 or something. They're very, in my opinion, they're very high bar and and so I think that's great. And then there's this kind of. Risk index that we put together, which could be like another. So so help me out. So if if we use this continuous risk index then isn't the population that we're sampling from or I guess I'm trying to say is? Aren't we making an assumption that everyone in? The population is. Has some degree to exposure of. Risk of experiencing modern slavery. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, this is interesting because the two indicators and I've picked up your question number, so I hope they are correct, silly. We'll be able to check for us, but there there are two you the way that exploitation is currently conceptualized is on a spec. Room and at one end you have minor infringements such as the National Living wage, which would be the question 36 are you paid sufficiently? And then at the extreme exploitation end, you'd have modern slavery question 80. So we've got two discrete markers on that scale. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So I wouldn't equate OK, failure to pay the national living wage with modern slavery. I don't think we can say that conceptually, but it is a form of exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And modern slavery is the most extreme form of exploitation. 

Speaker 

See. 

Speaker 2 

And then so we've got those two that you've sort of very cleverly identified as dichotomous variables. You're either slightly or not and you're either paid. Illegally or you're not. And then we've got this risk index, which is a more the grey area in between, which is the this composite. People just not. 

Speaker 1 

Tell perfect it helps a ton. No, and thank you for and this is again, This is why it's so awesome to work with you all. But so you can. My language was wrong. It's should be thinking about exploitation and modern slavery is 1 extreme form of exploitation. But really, there's this this spectrum and that that's. Enormously helpful that that helps me in thinking about the. Yeah. OK, that's really great. So then in that case, OK, so then the, the, the, the, the population is still domestic workers in the UK, I'm. Just thinking aloud, sorry. For for that, domestic workers in the UK and then we're the the, the, the, the, the hidden population are exploited workers within. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's fine. 

Speaker 1 

Exploited domestic workers in the UK, where that exploit measuring that exploitation we do in three different ways. One is this sort of minimal one is maximal and one is this, like you said, the great chain. I love that I think. 

Speaker 2 

The Gray area. 

Speaker 1 

That's why I. Didn't even I didn't really, I didn't. Caroline. OK, good. OK. So in that case, the so, so, so the I guess the one thing I can say. And I think I said the videos. I I'm surprised at how much more confident I am in the estimates from way back when, currently they seem. I'm willing to put my name to them. They seem quite they're. They're they're, in my opinion, they're shockingly high. They're they're very consistently depending on a bunch of model parameters, but sort of 30% is a conservative estimate. So there's something like 30 to 40. 

Speaker 2 

Oh brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Percent. So the interpretation there is. Again, depending on how we think about and measure exploitation 30 to 40% of domestic workers in the UK. Are experiencing some form of exploitation and in fact I can even tell you the the maximal one I was just looking at it is. So was it? It's question 80 is the. Is the the more extreme one? Yeah. 3030.7% is the estimate with the pretty reasonable estimate of uncertainty. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so. So I think this will make our, if you like, our message much more. It sort of turns it down a bit if we talk about exploitation. If we talked about 3040% in modern slavery, that that's very dramatic and we'll we'll be a front page of the Guardian, which we don't necessarily want to be that dramatic. So I think if we talk about labour exposition, it just tones it down slightly and we're acknowledging that. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Modern slavery is an extreme form, but it's not the the sole focus of the topic, so hopefully that makes you feel a bit more comfortable about the size of the problem as well. 

Speaker 1 

It it it it does and and like I said. Thank you I. I'm I'm so glad and I don't know. Feel kind of foolish actually, because like the, the more we talk, the more I realize. Oh, actually, I'm not. I haven't actually been thinking anyway, so like this, this modern slavery versus exploitation business is is. Yeah, no, these these results make a lot of sense. I mean, they're really, really high, but they're they're consistent and. So for example, if. You look at the estimated proportion that are experiencing this extreme form of slavery. It's 12% less than the estimated proportion of those experiencing the mildest form of exploitation, which logically makes perfect sense. And the the intervals. Makes some sense. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah, that that's good. So that's. So I suppose that on what we what I have done when I put the composite together was mixed up these the the dichotomous and the continuous variables. So we need to separate that out now obviously. So we have another stab at that. Celina you did you follow that? The the the logic that Scott sent through about this difference between because I've mixed up. Labour exploitation question 30. Whatever is with the other risk indicators of forced labour, I put it as a weighting at .3 and actually we can't do that well. I can't do that because it that will affect the composite variable calculation, so it won't be accurate the way the way I've currently specified it. 

Speaker 3 

I don't know which document opinion you're referring to. I know there has been the video recording from Doctor Moser and you have responded to it just before this meeting. This is so you sent me an e-mail before. 

Speaker 2 

Right. You know, this was really sort of what came out of Scott's earlier. I can't remember when we discussed it. Let me revise the composite measures and send those through to you. Well, send them through to both of you, but particularly to slim because we'll need to recalculate those composite. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Values based on the understanding that we've I've mixed up a dichotomous variable with it. Continuous risk indication. Fair report if you sent. 

Speaker 3 

Me the the document or whatever I should look at just to double check and recalculate. I can do that. 

Speaker 2 

That recalculating. No problem. Brilliant. I'm sorry it takes to work cuz it means going back and redoing. Something that we've already asked you to do, but. 

Speaker 3 

And that's part of the. Work. 

Speaker 2 

It's much clearer now. I think we're sort of learning as we go. It's heuristic. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. But so hang on, Caroline, I think I'm. About to have a second mental breakthrough for the day, so I understand the composite measure that we made is is like this weighted sum of these various indicators. But what's I missed? What why you think it? What? What's wrong with it? 

Speaker 2 

Because I've included question 36 and I've given it a slightly heavier weighting, but I've included it within the composite risk. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 1 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

So I I think I wasn't very happy when I did it and I think it's probably better if we split it up. Out. And then we then we've got this clarity about these two, the question 36 and the question 80 are clear, clearly illegal activities but at different ends of the scale, right? And the other risk factors provide a composite picture which could be indicative of forced labor. It's much cleaner if we do it that way. 

Speaker 1 

OK, I think I I think I say no. So it's not necessarily the case. That I think again. Thank you so. So I was originally thinking is that OK exploitations on a spectrum? We have these two kind of endpoints question 36 and question 80 and that the composite measure would sort of be in between these two endpoints. But if I'm understanding you, that's not really the right way to think about it we have. So that's one way to interpret. Here's the 2nd way to interpret. Yes, exploitation is on a continuum and here we have indicators for the endpoints. And then separately, we have this this continuous indicator which doesn't necessarily fit in between these two endpoints. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but it's not the case that does that make sense? It's not the case that. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, I think that's more accurate. It's separate. I think it's. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Separate. Yeah. Thank you. So. Much I tested that seriously. That was the 2nd in the last 15 minutes. You've given me two. Yeah. OK, that's very helpful. And actually that will help me in interpreting the I was a bit. Uncertain how to interpret the the estimate of the continuous indicator but but this discussion helps me a lot in in, in. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

In understanding what those results are are are saying relative to the to the dichotomous measures. So thank you. 

Speaker 2 

So. So that was I mean that. That was clear to me from your discussion about this difference between dichotomous variables and and a continuous 1, so that I think if you're happy with that approach, I think that sort of moves us forward, although it means redoing a. Bit of work. 

Speaker 1 

Perfect. And also just to be totally clear, I wasn't aware that's what I was saying. So really you you get credit for that Caroline completely. That's really no, no, that's that's that's awesome. OK, that's that's a huge clarification I do have and I don't want to hijack the conversation at all. I have sort of a big. I guess. Two medium sized questions and then some really kind of obnoxious small but technical questions if. If, if I may, if that's OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. 

Speaker 1 

So the OK, I guess maybe. OK, let me do the small ones first, so. Uh. Right. So the don't know is the deer stuff. Is fine. There's one. Nagging data issue that I still have and it's it's this business about zero, so some people I don't remember, I think I said 17 or something, a handful of people report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK. So you know they're reporting that their network size is 0. Now some of these are clearly an error because then when it comes to the referral question, can you give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK? They provide one. So. So some people who say, I know zero people in the UK then provide a cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK so. So clearly those people are wrong, so I'm comfortable sort of finding them and turning their zeroes into at least one again, that's that's conservative because we know that they've reported at least one, so one. OK, so that's one issue and then two. There's still some extra zeros, some people who say no. I know zero people in. Sorry. I know zero domestic workers in the UK and I've reported zero and I don't exactly know why, but those zeros are messing up the estimators. The estimators can't handle. I'm guessing it's like a divide by zero problem or something like that where? So the question? Is. What to do with the the true zeros? Two options, one is. We just sort of. Gin it up and say let's just add one for everybody, which isn't really. I mean it solves a problem technically, but it's really really sketchy. Or to remove the the true zeros. So what to do with the true zeros is one question and then this. The easier question is. What do we think about turning the zero the the wrong zeros into ones? Are we comfortable with that? Again, we're talking about a handful of of people, but with the sample size of 97, a handful of people is not true, you know? So does that make sense? The two questions make sense. Or am I? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, no, it it does make. And I mean, I'm tempted to say take them out, but I don't know what that. Does to the. That seems because anything else is a fudge, isn't it? 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. Exactly. So what I have been doing is just adding one to everybody and just saying like, you know, just but I completely agree with you that the, the, the what it does is it it it, it does increase our uncertainty and I think it increases. A bit I don't remember exactly, but I agree with you that that sort of that's the most principled, are we OK turning the zeros into ones for people who do nominate or or make a referral or? 

Speaker 2 

Are we? Are we turning them into the number that they nominate? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 2 

So they nominated two people. We turned them into twos. Is that? And then one, did they nominate one? Is that how? 

Speaker 1 

That's right. Exactly, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

We're doing it. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. That's how we could do it, which I. I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we have. 

Speaker 1 

I'm comfortable with that myself. 

Speaker 2 

If if yeah, I think if we take out the ones that are. 

Speaker 1 

If you all are. 

Speaker 2 

Through zeroes. Don't know what the implications of that. Has for the. For how we're sampling, but I mean, if we just say that's what we've done. It's a limitation of the estimating technique really, isn't it? 

Speaker 1 

Yes, that's right. It's not a data limitation, it's not a data limitation, it's an estimation. You're 100% right? Yeah, it's it's an, it's a limitation of the estimation. That's right. 

Speaker 2 

So you have to. 

Speaker 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I think we can probably just say that. So it's. And so we've got 2, two things that we're doing then. So we're taking out. The true the ones that really are zeroes, and for the ones that. Do nominate. We're then increasing their. We we're correcting the data. 

Speaker 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

To reflect that they do know. They do have other people in their other they do have other. Domestic workers in their networks. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, exactly. And I think that's conservative, but I have to say what I mean is I think. What we're doing is we're saying, well, we know we don't know this person's degree size. We know that it's an error, and so we're assigning it a value that's the smallest possible size it could be. If you've nominated two people given 2 cell phone numbers, we know that, you know at least two. But maybe, you know, more that you just have it nominated. So by changing the 0 to a 2IN that case. That's. I think what we're doing we're underestimating that person's network size, which I think is conservative. I think what I mean is I think I think that won't inflate our our estimates. I think I should double check that though. But if if it's, I'm almost sure. But anyway, I'll have, I'll that should be my homework, but if so, then I think that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Perfectly fine, because what? We're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot, really. I mean, so whatever we find is gonna be. Yeah. Is. Yeah. I think it's gonna be fine. So because the degree set. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That's so there's sort of two, two-part solutions to that problem. So we take out the true ones and then we. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Sort of modify the data to reflect the actual sample size for the others. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Good. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, those both sound reasonable to me. Salim, do do. Steve. Does that sound OK? 

Speaker 3 

I have the similar suggestion that you have made based on the number or the amount of people they have provided the phone numbers, so we could take the amount of the phone numbers they have provided although. We have reported in the earlier question that they don't know any other domestic workers in the UK, so modifying it should should make it consistent with the other existing survey findings. 

Speaker 1 

Good. Excellent. Thank you. OK. Yeah, that's what that is excellent. So see, in increasing order of easiness. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Uh, yeah, I'm increasing order of easiness, uh. OK, I'll save this. So what we want to see, but that's at the end. Domestic worker size. So I I went back and double checked and it's it's it's it's it's true. Terms of. So the thing that we're estimating is a proportion. But to do that, one of the one of the inputs into so we have this our data and we have a bunch of parameters and all that's great. One of the inputs that's required for the estimators that I'm currently using, not for the end sum estimator, but for the the RDS estimators is a is a guess is a is a prior belief on the the the size of the population that we're sampling from. So what that means is. We ideally we would know how many domestic workers there are in the UK with the cell phone, so we know we we know the number, we know the size of the population that we're sampling from. Not enough course, not necessarily the number of those experiencing exploitation. This doesn't have to be a hard and fast number. It can be like. Well, here's my best guess. Or here's a range or whatever, whatever. But we need that number, and I've been looking. I kind of just, I thought I thought it would be easy to find. Like. On like a Labor Statistics site or something. And I I I haven't come up with a great number, one that I'm super happy with. My best guess is something like 1.7 million, which sounds a bit high, but then again there's a lot of people in the UK anyway, so if you have suggestions on where to get information on. On reliable information on the number of domestic workers in the UK in the period that we were sampling, that you all were were sampling, that would be great, would have been doing is just making up numbers and. I've just been. I've been making up numbers and sort of increasing them by orders of magnitude. So suppose there's 10,000. Suppose there's 100,000. Suppose there's a million, and seeing how, just as a very crude way, to see how, how the how those inputs affect the outputs. And the the good news is they they seem to affect the outputs not very much. So there is this is great news actually this this means it's our estimates are relatively insensitive to to the prior knowledge namely the the number of domestic workers in the UK that said at some point we'll need to settle on a number that that you know will will use I mean and of course we'll say. See Appendix for robustness. But you know for. The stuff that we report. I'll need a number. Does anyone have any thoughts on where to where I could, where to find information on on that? 

Speaker 2 

Well, the only thing that we've suggested in the past, which may not be very helpful, is the overseas domestic worker visa numbers because that is a fixed statistic that ought to relate to how many visas for a six month period because they they last for six months and then they expire and people. Have to go home. Theory. And I can't remember off the top of my head what that number was, but I think it was around 76,000. 

Speaker 1 

It sounds about right. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So if we, I mean that's my best stabber. An official statistic. I don't know if you've come across anything. 

Speaker 3 

So we have adopted, we have adopted to the most recent. 

Speaker 2 

Addition to that. 

Speaker 3 

With publishing from, I think it must also in the Guardian and it also referred guardian of times that news article and it also referred to the government UK page of UK. Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah. So they regularly publish that. So yeah, it's about 70, something 70 or 80,000 I. 

Speaker 3 

The update. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so I don't know how satisfactory that is. I haven't. I'm not familiar with the web pages you mentioned that you looked. At. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So if you if it's possible to send me the link, I could have a look. And and see if I can. If that sort of turns it into any more robust ideas. But at the moment that the only thing I can suggest which doesn't help us for the non British, sorry for the British nationals, but. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, but it's, I mean, it's fine. It's it. I mean, the the good news is like the, the the qualitative results are really, really again, surprisingly robust, so. You know, we can see here's a number that we can use and we can give a site to and say clearly this is an underestimate. Again, C appendix B for sensitivity analysis. You know I'm I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm I'm perfectly fine with that because the results are. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Again, qualitatively are really consistent, so I'm fine with that. So so no, thank you for that thing for that. OK. I've got two more. One at least one I think is a bit is a bit tricky. So I've been so you can identify three groups, 3 subgroups here. At least I I'm sure you all can probably identify more those by ethnicity. So those coming from the Philippines. Those are easy to identify. Those that come from some Spanish speaking countries. Like Bolivia, Colombia, but also Spain and. And. UK nationals who aren't. One of these. Who aren't in the first two to two categories. Is. The question is, do we want to do anything with that information in in in the following sense? In fact, Caroline you suggested we could perform estimation separately, like completely separately like like, just use this group data. Just use this data. Just use this dating at three different set the the the UK people. I mean it's. Really small so. The main interest would be on the so for the Philippines, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I wanted to get your thoughts on well. So the general question is, do we want to do anything with that information here? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Are some things we could do. Split them up into three groups, perform analysis separately, but especially between the two non UK and national groups. Question mark. If so, how comfortable are we group the Philippine one? The Philippine Group subgroup seems pretty, very straightforward, very justified to me. Are we OK? Lumping Ecuadorians with Bolivians with Spanish, you know, sort of putting all Spanish people coming from Spanish speaking countries together. When I say together, I mean. In the same subgroup. To to which we will. Perform our estimation. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

I don't know what. Sensitivities we might be and the the thing that comes to mind is Burt Burt and his class. Have you? Have you ever read a paper by Cyril Burt about? It's highly controversial racist science. And actually, he lumped people together and measured their brain size, and then concluded that. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

People in certain racial groups have smaller brains. It's got. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

I remember this. Yeah, this is. 

Speaker 2 

And. And there's been a huge critique. Obviously this paper. Yeah, and. It was depicted as racist science because people, because of the assumptions that he made when he grouped people. 

Speaker 3 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 2 

And I don't know what the sensitivities are about grouping Ecuadorians and Spanish people into some sort of larger category. And and I don't know whether that any if we did that, it would. 

Speaker 1 

I don't know either. 

Speaker 2 

Stand the test of time, or whether we might be called out in future for some sort of atrocity that we don't even know we're committing. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So I don't know about that I want is there value in doing the Filipino grouping to me as far as I can predict sounds safer, yeah. Anna, is it? Is it? Does it show any distinction? Any distinct differences from taking the I don't know. 

Speaker 1 

I I I tell take your. Point it's a thank. You. It's a very good I hadn't even thought about the sort of tested time aspect. That's a really, really good point. My wanting my, my reason for doing my reason for. Doing this is twofold. One is just very, very technical because the. The estimators that I'm using have this underlying assumption that truly in the world the social network is connected, which means that there's some path between the Ecuadorian and our sample, and the Philippine and our sample. Somebody this person knows, somebody knows somebody who knows somebody, somebody who knows this person. Fine. We don't have to make that assumption, but it makes my life a lot easier. I think there's reasons to challenge that assumption, namely by by language. For example, you might think that this, that. A group of. Philippine domestic workers are. Are are separate, are separated from other maybe, and maybe that's racist of me to say in the 1st place, but but. 

Speaker 2 

I'm not suggesting we're being racist, I'm just using that as an example, but did when he realized he was making a racist assumption when he did it. Yeah. And I think we just have to be careful if we under we, we might not understand the the assumptions we're making. Yep. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I think I think that's what I'm hearing from you is, is is maybe just. Don't subgroup. Well then the second reason I was I raised this, I wanted to separate. This is because because of these, in my opinion, relatively large estimated proportions, I was curious about heterogeneity, right, like where where are these big numbers coming from? Basically. So that was sort of a more substantive motivation and and and to answer your question. And I don't know. I haven't actually performed. I haven't done the estimation by subgroup, so I don't even know if it's anything interesting there, so maybe I should do that first, and this might be moot. I guess is, I don't know the answer to. Question, but what I'm hearing is like play it safe and don't. Maybe it's not such a good. Maybe we just leave. We leave the analysis at the. Using the entire sample all at once and justice state the assumptions and move on. 

Speaker 2 

I don't know. It's tempting. It's tempting to have a look at it. I mean, particularly for me, for the Filipino group, because we've got quite a large 2/3 of the group is Filipino. So could we somehow test? The distinction between the Filipino group and the broader sample is that that strikes me as being a sort of safe test to initially dip our toe in the water with hopefully out and not offending anybody by by means that we know that we don't understand. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. That's and like I said, that's actually on my end. That's a. That's a much easier data task because identifying that subgroup is just easier. 

Speaker 2 

Nicely, clearly delineated. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So thank you. I I I'll do that and include that my next like I said, I. We haven't. I just haven't done that analysis. But yeah, I'll do that. OK. That sounds great. OK. So the last hard question is. What do we want to present? What? What? What do you do? You want me to make tables? Do you want to make pictures? Do you want me to make P values? Like what? What do we want to? From the results, what do we want to show and how do we want to show it? I don't know if I'm being clear. I'm probably being overly vague, aren't I? So we'll have. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. Yeah, no, I think it's a really reasonable question. It's just one, I don't think that I know the answer to. So I suppose it's tied in to where we think this might be publishable and how technical a journal that is and and whether it's a journal that would require that sort of technical detail. Or if we were publishing in a more lay journal for want of a better way of putting it. Whether that would be a turn off because they just it depends, I suppose. Who's gonna review it and what are they going to expect to see? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Because we talked about various journal articles, sorry, journal outlets. We talked about the Journal of Modern Slavery, where I'm sure I don't think it would be going well. I may not be right. Then it might be going to statistical experts. In whatever technique we, we finally land on. So in in because there is quite a lot of prevalence estimation within the modern slavery literature. So there will be people who do have statistical understanding. But I think you'd also mentioned was IT pros PLOS. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Uh-huh. Uh, huh. 

Speaker 2 

And and really, I don't know anything about what their readership would expect. 

Speaker 1 

They're pretty technical, so modern slavery you're saying, is a pretty technical, or at least they have. Technical competences. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I think there is increasing interest in prevalence within the modern slavery literature. There are recognised practitioners. So I'm thinking of Clifford signs at the unit at Nork and they do a lot of prevalence estimation. They work in the modern slavery field. So I would say if I was suggesting reviewers. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Uh-huh. 

Speaker 2 

That's it's that research group that potentially I'd identifiers being a potential reviewer. 

Speaker 1 

No, I'm. I'm taking notes. Thank you. OK, so. To make my life easy, it sounds like I'll start with with. Just text, you know, point estimates, conference rules, whatever. Personally I'm I'm very very visual, so I think I think pictures are are easier to interpret for me than than than words. But but but it's also more work on my purse. It sounds like I'll start with the point estimates confidence interval. So the the, the, the, the plain Jane so to speak. But now I should say ways of present. Presentation and then we can tweak from if we need to. When we get closer to submission is it? Is that what I'm hearing is that? Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think I don't think I can add anything particularly helpful. To this conversation, and other than just trying to tailor it to whatever outlet we go for. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I I too like diagrams like that and I think Celine's already added a sort of representation of the network. So something along those lines really helps to. To make the. Hard statistics. More understandable. Yeah. So, yeah. Have have I agree with you that diagrams have great explanatory power. 

Speaker 1 

Totally the same. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. OK. OK, I'll. Good, but that sounds good. So. I'll sort of we'll. I'll start and then like if we can revisit this when we get closer to submission, but just no, that's helpful for me. That's very, very helpful for me. I think those are all my questions. Let me. Double check please. Ohh, and and you're right, I do. I haven't this there is this third approach actually of getting increasingly excited by or about that I haven't done, which is this combining the the RDS with the the. Yeah, your .7, Caroline, exactly everything I've done and we've talked about is very off the shelf, which is fine. I'm not at all. I mean, these are. This is absolutely. Proper but but there is this we initially way back when started talking about this he had this very cool idea to do in some estimation and and and talked and thought and Scott thought some more and read some more and confused himself and but yeah there is there definitely is this way to combine the two. I haven't done it. It will be manual, but I'm I'm I'm very excited by it about it because mainly for the comparison, because you know all of these RDS techniques are. Getting qualitatively the same, you know 30 to 40% depending on XYZ, whatever. But they're all this class. Of estimators are all giving. Similar, but in my opinion really high estimates, and I'm really curious to see how this sort of you know, this outsider, this outsider in some method would come. It's also cool because there's a sense. In which it's. It's it's using more information that you already have in your sample, which I think is I'm always a huge fan of. Of that. You know using all the data that you can. So I haven't done that. I don't know what your thoughts on like is that should I make that a priority is that is it is the. Is the RDS enough? Do you have any thoughts? 

Speaker 2 

It sounds really exciting. I mean it's you've got the time to do it. Yeah, well, she's always. We don't. We never have time to do anything. But if you want. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

If you find there is time, then it sounds really exciting and really interesting and that is where we started this journey trying to work out how to do nuisance so to try and if we if we can. If our data can say anything along those lines that would be really exciting to know. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I I. Agree. And even if I'm again, it depends on where we're gonna do it. It's not like. The Journal of the American Statistical Association. I mean, it's not. It's what I'm trying to say. There is a, there is a methodological innovation here. It's not huge. It's sort of. Taking this paper and taking this paper and recognizing that they have the same D and I can use that, I can put them together, but I haven't seen it done. And I think it's, I think it's a very cool idea to to combine these two and like, like you said here like since since. I mean the information's there. It's sitting in our Excel file, right? Like why not? OK, so if we're gonna do that. Then I might. Ask one piece of help from Celine or whoever, and that's to code up the bootstrapping procedure so I can do the estimator. But we'll need to estimate the uncertainty and we know how to do that. It's with the paper that actually you summarized and included Caroline in your bootstrapping doc. Uh. But we'll have to. We'll have to write that up in our. Can you do that, Salim? Or is that not something you're comfortable with? 

Speaker 3 

I I can start looking into it. 

Speaker 1 

OK, that would be. 

Speaker 3 

Great. And I will update you. 

Speaker 1 

Wonderful, the. I'll e-mail you both with the let me make note to your bootstrap it. There's a lot already written. You've got a good head start in that, like there's the paper is pretty readable. They have some supplementary information. They have some R code already. So you you. You're not starting from scratch, but it would. You will need. Well, we will need at some point to implement this for this particular method. It would be a big help to me if. I could do the estimation part and you could work on the bootstrap. Part. And then ****, and then press publish. 

Speaker 3 

Can you can you share this paper again with me? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, absolutely. I'll share the paper and the the supplemental information. There is bootstrap just making notes to myself. But yeah, that's absolutely fine and I'm glad to hear that you're excited about the sum too, Caroline, that, that that's invigorating. That's that, that, that, that, that helps. That helps me. Like I like that. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really good. I think. I think there's one thing we have missed from your from that list and your video, I don't think we've talked about #2. Which was how how we how, how we've dealt with the don't knows in the data at the moment and we perhaps need to to code them slightly differently. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. Good point. 

Speaker 2 

Perhaps as missing, I think that was your suggestion. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. And so I, I and. Please do not take any offense whatsoever. Slam your your your your recoding is is absolutely you know invaluable. But I I did change it a little bit in that. I think and please correct me if I think you had been coding. So, so, so so the issue is there's, there's, there's these different categories that one can answer, of course and. Almost always one of the answers is don't know or not. Don't prefer prefer not to say or what have you and slim you had been coding those replies as an absence of. Exploitation, however, measured in whatever type of exploitation. And. I've recorded those as just missing, so you just take those observations out again. That's a bit conservative because that because by wait is it no, it's anti conservative. So the absence of yeah. So right my bad. That's anti conservative because by removing the. By taking OK two options, people who say they don't know are not experiencing exploitation. People who say don't know are not in our analysis. Here's Salim's initial way. Here's what I what I'm suggesting now that I'm thinking about it, I think my suggested way is is is anti conservative because relatively speaking it'll look like there's more people in exploitation. Using my method in Salim's method. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

Interesting, Caroline, thanks for bringing this up. I I missed this. Yes. So the question is what do we want to do with the donos? That's exactly right. 

Speaker 2 

OK, I'm just following what you're saying about. If you take them out. 

Speaker 1 

I think that's right. 

Speaker 2 

And it makes things look. Plus. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Worse. Worse. Worse, better. Right. Right. I think that's right. Because there's. 

Speaker 2 

They had been coded as not experiencing exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, which is not really what we want to do. I suppose by nature I would be more conservative. And we don't want given that we've already got 30 to 40% of the population. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

You don't want to make it make it. Look even worse. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So we could say that we could say well, here's how we couldn't knows. And by the way that's conservative because yeah, we're because really we're making a judgment call we we just as easily could say well, no actually the don't knows are experiencing exploitation. I mean it's arbitrary right like how how, how, how so in in putting it in the not experiencing. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Exploitation. Counting them as not experiencing exploitation. Yeah, I agree with you, Caroline. It's. It's making our yeah, it's conservative because then. Our estimated proportion of those experiencing, yeah, the estimated proportion would be small. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. My apologies, Selim. I did. I you had it right all along. My bad. 

Speaker 2 

My bad. No, it's really useful clarification that so we and we're just sort of being clear about what we're doing, but it's good that we don't have to recode it, so. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. No, that's great. That's great. 

Speaker 2 

But I I I think we're erring on the side of caution, so that seems to be the right way to to be airing. Agreed. Brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

I've been trying to type up what we've agreed just on the same e-mail. The only one I haven't got anything against is 6. What do we say? Ohh the six is just a statement really. You would just your the current method you've been using for analysis and what it does. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. And so I finally sort of wrapped my head around these RDS sort of in in in a way that I should have ages ago. And I sort of I see what they're all. They're all. They're all doing the same thing and they're all just making a little bit of adjustments differently. And So what I'm thinking of doing is saying, you know, when we review the literature like, OK. Here's. These here's all these various RDS methods and yeah, they have different assumptions and we're going to do all of them, but in the appendix. And here's the one that we're gonna pick to present because. In fact, actually the one I found one even better than the s s RDS or RDSS called the model assisted. I like it better at least, but the point is we have all these sort of related methods. These RDS methods and my thinking is to just pick one. For for presentation in the main text and then say you know see Appendix whatever for for comparison and the. The the things. Really are quite different and and but again for us the numbers are virtually identical. Weirdly so. Yeah, I know, right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that means something about robustness, I think. That's my that's not rigorous, but that's sort of my. My thinking is that. Or it could mean something else, and it could mean that that whole debate and the prevalence literature is is wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles, you know is is, is doesn't really matter, it could. It could mean that the the differences in the assumptions and the the way that the different weights are calculated doesn't really matter very much is what it could mean. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

But regarding .6 is that is that are are we cool with these simply picking one for presentation purposes and then, you know, here's the Boltzmann Hoff estimator. And here's the guile assess estimator. And here's the model assisted estimator. 

Speaker 2 

Interesting. 

Speaker 1 

Blah blah, blah blah blah. Or or should we or alternatively I? Guess we could just. Pick one and and just justify it as strongly as as we can. I don't know. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. I think we have to. We have a reason for picking the one that we picked, but that that's up to us. And I'm happy to be guided by you on that. 

Speaker 1 

That's that's very polite and very clever. If you think that's. Very good girl. But the reason I'm I'm a little bit humming hiding is is there's there's basically two that I think are sort of the clear. UM. 

Speaker 2 

From the city. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly. And and I don't really have a strong preference on either. So that's that's more homework for me, I suppose the. Yeah, yeah, well, the homework bit is is is the justification, right? Like, I've got to pick one. And so right. So two are easy to justify. Which one of the two? I mean, again at the end of the day subsequently doesn't. It's not going to matter because the all but. But you're 100, right? Like we gotta pick one to use in the main text to show the results of. To do the bootstraps for them, whatever. So that's yeah, that's that's. All right, that's on me. That's on me. Very good, very good. Thank you. Bring that up, Caroline. Again. Thank you for bringing that up. It's just you brought up a really great point. So thanks. 

Speaker 2 

Right. I think we're there. Brilliant. It's really exciting. This is a lovely conversation to have on a Friday. We should we should do more often. 

Speaker 1 

I'd love to, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And is it sensible to try and put a a provisional meeting date in the diary just in case it keeps us sort of at least talking about when they can be, even if we find nearer the time that we can't and our Friday is generally OK for everybody, I can generally do a Friday, so then you're nodding and Scott this. 

Speaker 1 

Afternoon, after it would have to be. 

Speaker 2 

Afternoon. 

Speaker 1 

Definitely. After one, uh, likely so this time is fine. Two is totally fine. But yeah, Friday after one at the earliest. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So if I pop another date in in what a months time or sooner? 

Speaker 1 

You know I would, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Then sort of three weeks, 2 weeks. 

Speaker 1 

Slim how much time do you have to? OK. Yeah. Anything's good for me. My well, once I finish marking. 

Speaker 3 

16th. 

Speaker 1 

Anything good with? Me, which should happen this weekend. So yeah, I'll have time this. So so whenever is fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry, what did you say two or three weeks? 

Speaker 3 

Which would be the 16th of February. OK, at 2:00 PM or before noon or before noon time. 

Speaker 2 

OK, 2:00 PM. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's put that in and we'll see what happens when we get there. And we can always tickle it out if we need to. But yeah, that's super. 

Speaker 3 

So for my tasks, before we end conversation, I will do that coding up for the bootstrapping. And Doctor Moser, you said you would share that paper with me and some information for what I should do and how I do it. And Caroline, you mentioned earlier something about checking or rechecking the the composite measures. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, yeah. Recalculating the composite measure. I'll send you A1. Pager of what I think now ought to be in it. 

Speaker 3 

OK, this would be helpful. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I'll try and do that as soon as I can, which probably means I have to try and do it this afternoon and then we'll. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK then. 

Speaker 2 

And then, yeah, if you can just recalculate risk variable 2. If we keep the original, but we we try another column with the revised composite. And then we haven't lost anything. But I think at the moment it's wrong as it stands for, for how we're conceptualizing the data. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Thanks everyone. It's really nice to see you all and and and and happy 2024. So all right, we'll e-mail and talk soon. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. Yeah. Good to see you shot. Yeah, I'll. I'll send the out. The points of the note that I made. So we've all got a copy. Brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Thanks everyone. Talk to you later. 

Speaker 3 

Thank you. Hi. 

 

## Voice 042_sdDW20240308.txt
So I guess just a quick update on my end, so I've been, things are coming along, things
are coming along, but it's just, I just need a lot of electrons, so I just have these big
runs is what's going on right now, so I have a preferred model and then I have like 50,
alternative models for robustness, shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all
the electrons, so that's sort of chugging along. I'm almost done, but haven't finished implementing
the Fihan and Solvnik. How can I, yeah. The insum, the insum, so I'm almost done with that.
They, I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to
re-learn it. There's, so I'm doing that and then when I do that, then we'll get an estimate and do
the bootstraps and that's, I think that'll be pretty neat. There's one weird thing about the data
that I discovered, there's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry, before I get there,
I did subset it by just the people who identified as Philippine O and the estimates are about the
same, they're slightly higher, it's something like 47%, depending on how you measure exploitation,
so, but they're about the same, but slightly higher and I haven't done anything else on that,
the data. So, there are two weird sources of errors. The one is, is these, these true zeros,
remember we talked about from a while ago, so people could say that they don't know any, but
okay, sorry, two other things, I should make notes to myself so I can pop size.
You want to record it, Scott? That's okay, I'm, I take furious notes. Record it somewhere, yeah.
But you feel, I don't object, please feel free to if you want to the
pop size. Oh, so you could, people have reported that they know zero domestic workers in the UK
with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone, so that's, we fixed that up, that's fine.
And then there was another one, which is really weird, which is where they, the number of people
they reported knowing, Q13 I'm pretty sure is the one, I know these things are stuck in my head
now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than the, the,
the number of people they recruit, where recruiting is determined by the node one,
node two, the network structure. So that's really weird. I don't, that one took me a while to sort
of, and it's two people, but those two people really, really messed me up. So, so I fixed that.
So, so now we have a new personal degree size, which is the max of all of those.
So it's, it's the max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the
number of people that you recruit as given by the network structure. And like I said, the last one
sort of a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not,
I'm not super worried about it. And then we have these things this thing, we have these suspicious,
suspicious variable. So we can, we can, what I'm trying to say is like, we can, we can remove
the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat. And that's, that's, that's fine. Okay.
So that's that implementing the FIHAN. And so that's just electricity at this point, like it's
just, it's, it's done. And again, the estimates are very, very, very consistent between 30 and 40
percent, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me, that's shockingly high, but it's,
it's very consistent. So in some I'm working on the bootstrap is working. And I'm almost done with
the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff. So we need the, the size of the frame.
So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year.
We needed that for the, the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that.
The preferred number, thanks to you, Caroline, 980,000, I think, something like that came from
Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah. And again, I've found it out. I use,
I use sample frame sizes from 10,000, 100,000, not in the 980,000, 1.5 million, just again,
for robustness. I should probably add, because I think one of the, I don't know what was called,
I drew it down, the, there are these two occupational classes that you used Caroline from.
And, and one of them was like spot on. And then the other one was sort of, was plausible. But
so what I'm trying to say is I should, I should use, so currently the preferred model uses the
sum of those two numbers. But I should, I should, wait, and that's fine. I'm happy to report that
and everything. But again, for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated
whatever. So that's, that's, that's for me to do. Now, the probalters. So we need to know this,
I only have one, and that's the number of people, you know, who have been referred to
the National Referral Mechanism, or whatever it's called, NRM. So we have that question.
And we, thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people in the UK, like we know the size
of that group. And so, I'm sorry, I'm rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two
population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame, which we needed from before.
And there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the in sum, we also need the
size of these probalter groups. So I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. And it
just sort of, just sort of adds some complexity to, it adds noise really to these estimators. So I
haven't done that. That's going to be more electrons, more electrons to use. So right,
probalter group, that was the other pop size. And I told you about the weird, this thing with the
people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry, I don't know how to count. And that's
where I'm at. So sorry, I didn't, again, sorry, I was coding furiously, hoping I could get it done
before three, but then I thought I didn't know how to read my calendar. So sorry about that. So,
so that's sort of the update on my end. Data is
I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress. And I
suppose the question is, what do you need from us? So I think, I think we're good to
electrons. That's fine. I think we're ready for venue discussion, where we want to submit it.
And Slim, were we able to, did the Zoteros references work for you? I don't know. I sent
it. It did. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So basically, so what I'm trying to say, I think, I think we're,
we're into like, once, while my batch is running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you
know, writing up the results, conclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like, yeah.
Okay, that's fantastic. So in terms of journal targets, I mean, the question is, I suppose,
within the business school, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list.
With ABS? Sorry. If I can, Association of Business School, Journal Quality List,
the school signs up to the Dora principles that it's not all about journal destination,
but it is a factor. So one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal target is
that list. Okay. But I tend to publish anywhere that, so I have not really been following the rules
very strictly. And I don't know what your publication targets might look like. And so I'm
quite happy to be ecumenical about this, and not necessarily pick a journal off that list,
just because that's what you're supposed to do. But, but having said that, there is one journal
potentially, which is a three star journal. So it's not an absolute top quality, but it's
a rectangle called Work Employment and Society, which has a strong theoretical basis. So I don't
know whether, well, that would mean that I would need to do some background work on,
they definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's sort of sociologically focused.
And the advantage is one of the editor-in-chiefs is actually Marek,
Causes Inksteed, who is, yeah, who's obviously at the business school. So I could sound him out
and just say, would you accept a sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated
paper in the domestic workers sphere? Is that something that you think might fall within this
scope of the journal? So that was the target that sort of occurred to me, but I'm very open to
publishing where it would suit you, Scott. I mean, I think the ABS list is a great place to start.
Because I know nothing about this, this field at all. But it sounds like, I mean,
yeah, more stars is better in general for me. But at the same time, like I'm not,
like you, Caroline, like I'm not, I'm not picky about these things. But, you know,
my general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down the tears as the rejection
ladder just come, come in, which in my case, they, they fill up my mailbox. So that would be,
yeah, so I mean, ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are sort of appropriate for, you know,
labor, domestic work, UK, human rights, whatever, and start there and yeah, work our way down would be,
I guess one of the things I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important
is, so the strategy I just articulated is, is a lengthy process. So, so I guess we should talk
about timeline. Are there are people going in for promotion or jobs or other, are there,
is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or?
I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know, how
does that sound for you? Yeah, again, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm okay taking time and doing the, the
start high. And when's the next, do we know when the ref cycle ends? I don't, I don't know. When is it?
Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's ref 2029 now. But when the actual
ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline for paper submissions is, I don't know, but I mean
24, we've got a few, we've got enough time to try a higher journal and then knock down to it. So
we, I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars. If you think we'd like to
start with that. That would be my preference, if that's it. If, if there's, yeah, that would be
my preference. I'd like, I'd like you, I don't, I don't have time constraints. Somewhere like the
British Journal of Management. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view,
a bit of a quantitative bias. So that might work in our favor. And I can have a bit of a
search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But I mean,
the fact that it's UK statistics might be quite appropriate for them. We just,
we just might need to sort of cite it in their literature to sort of see what debates they're,
they're talking about. So that's a bit of work for me to do. And then, yeah, see what I mean,
I asked our Dean and Alex to our terms about this. And he suggested research policy
and science. Okay. Neither of those journals I know anything about. I did look at the
aims and scope and to me, didn't seem to fit. But that was his initial suggestion. I don't know
if you know anything about science. Science is absolutely top. But yeah, it's a strange
fit. I wouldn't, I think of them as doing more like biology kinds of stuff. I mean,
basically, what they do is like really, really high profile stuff, regardless of field. And so
maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is high profile, maybe. But yeah,
it's said to be as an odd, as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you.
Yeah. I've heard of you. Do you know anything about research policy?
No, but I think policy sounds like a good, a good class of journals to maybe target.
Although we don't really have any policy implications currently, but, but that could,
that could be strengthened perhaps. Yeah, that brings to mind another journal called Millbank
Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're
A, B, B, S. That's possible from a policy point of view, but maybe British Journal of Management
is better. Excellent. Yeah. So, and then I suppose work, employment and society, if we fail with
BJM, it's like the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. Good. Excellent. Excellent.
That's great. That's great. That's great. That sounds all right. Sounds great for me.
So if I do a bit of a literature search, the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until
April. That's fine. And I've got seminar weeks coming up. So, and my diary is absolutely chock
block. So the, the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days, I think I could perhaps spend
some time. Actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well. So
I can do, make a start on that then. And then, so at least get you sort of some indication and
yeah, but we, I think British Journal of Management does seem to be quite a good fit. And that's,
that's a good journal. Excellent. If we get into that. Let's, let's start there. Let's start there.
I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week, because like you, the next two to
three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff. But I'm,
reading week has been good and I'm making, so I'm going to make a push to try to get, you know,
the results done. Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team. It's
really, really, really, really great. It's been fantastic working with the both of you. So thank
you. Yeah, so it'd be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah,
if we were to aim to do that for the summer, is that too, is that all right? I think by the time
we sort of tidied everything up. Yeah. And then, yeah. Yeah, June, I think it was a good target.
And July, if we get, if we miss, you know, I think that's a, I think it's very feasible as well.
I mean, like I said, the right sort of April, we'll, we'll be able to come back to it and polish and
then, you know, yeah. And I'm hoping next term might be quite as bad as this term. I'll have a
little bit, it'll be just marking then. Just marking. It just never ends. It just never ends. So
but okay, this is great. I'm going to, I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll, I'll email you
with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the, I'm not expecting any
surprise. So the RDS stuff is done, done. And then the insum, I don't know. I'm not expecting to be
surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. Fantastic. Really, really good. Was there anything from you
Selene that you wanted to share with us? I have two points. First, Dr. Moser, do you have anything
that you need from my side other than the sort of references? Is there anything else? That's it.
And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We started with BigBot. You may have
seen my email that I don't want to be included in the publication for this research. What do you
think about that? I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your, to your PhD advisor, Dr.
Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need, if you want to stay in academia, you need publications.
And in the past, you've mentioned sort of wanting to fortify your quantitative
credentials. And this would certainly help with that. I mean, I think I understand his point.
If I'm not saying this point, it's something like branding, like you don't want to get labeled as
something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just, you need publications
and full stop. So, I wasn't from Dr. Randall. I have to say it's not from Dr. Randall. It's from
the mentor in the US when I spent time there, because I'm still having meetings with the professor
there. And I see he is also the Dean of the department for international relations and politics.
And recently we had another meeting and he told me it would be not good if I have a profile
that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that. And I,
and I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I don't include my name.
I mean, it's one, it's your decision. And of course, I completely, I completely respect that. And
I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was Dr. Randall. You might run by him then in that
case, get his opinion, because he's a proper IR theory person and see what, have you discussed it
with him? No, we'll meet on Tuesday. So I will brace this up then. Okay. Because I was saying
to Celine, we could perhaps acknowledge him. If he's so sure that he doesn't want to be included
in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I just wanted to perhaps it was an Indian idiosyncrasy of the
American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would just caution you to find out, Celine,
whether it's in a matter he's talking from an American's perspective.
When that the same applies in Europe, if that's where you want to end up.
All my supervisors are American. Dr. Mosa, Dr. Randall, also the drug supervisor.
Sorry.
Other than New Carolina.
But for sure. I mean, I think sort of the bottom line is it's your decision, of course. And
I think I can speak truthfully to say that like, you've definitely contributed a lot. And I think,
yeah, you deserve to be credited in some way. And thank you. I mean, you've done a lot to help
with the project. So yeah, thank you. Thank you too that I could learn from both of you. I still
have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will update you both after I speak to my first
supervisor, Dr. Randall. Yeah. Okay. Brilliant. Thanks then. Thanks everyone. Have a great week.
Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on email from now on?
Yeah, I think email is probably good. April. Okay. Yeah.
Right, that's super. Let's stick with that then. Thanks everyone. Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.
Bye. Bye. Bye.

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

Very quick. 

Speaker 2 

Good, good. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Hi. 

Speaker 2 

Hi. Hi, everyone. So I guess just a quick. Update on my end, so I've been. Things are coming along. Things are. Things are. Coming along, it's just. I just need a lot of. Electrons. So I just. Have these just. Big, Big runs is is what's going on right now. So I have a preferred model and then I have like 50, you know, alternative models for robustness. We'll shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all the electrons. So that's sort of chugging along. 

Speaker 

I'm. 

Speaker 2 

Almost done, but haven't finished implementing the the the Feehan and Saul Solnik. 

Speaker 3 

I'm going to, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

The the, the the Insum the insum. So I'm I'm almost done with that, the. I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to relearn it. There's so I'm I'm doing that. And then when I do that, then we'll. Get an estimate and do the bootstraps and that's I think that'll be. That'll be pretty. There's one weird thing about the data that I discovered. There's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry. Before I did there, I did subset it by just the the people who identified as Philippine. Oh, and the estimates are about the same. 

Speaker 3 

Oh yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Slightly higher it's something like 47% depending on how you measure exploitation. So but they're about the same but slightly higher. And I haven't done anything else on that the data so. There are two weird sources of of errors. The one is, is these these true zeroes? Remember we talked about from a while ago so people could say that they don't know any but. OK, sorry. Two other things. I should make. Note to myself so I can pop size. 

Speaker 3 

You want to record it, Scott? 

Speaker 2 

It's OK. I'm I I take furious notes, but. 

Speaker 3 

You've recorded it somewhere, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But you, you. You feel? I don't know. Please feel free to if you want to the. Pop size. Oh, so you could people have reported that they know zero. Domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone so that that's we fixed that up that's fine. And then there was another one which is really weird which is where they. The number of people they reported knowing Q13, I'm pretty sure is the one I I know these things are stuck in my head now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than. The the the number of people they recruit. Where recruiting is determined by the node one node 2 the the the the the the network structure. So that's really weird. I I that one took me a while to sort of and the two people but those two people really, really messed me up so so I fixed that. So so now we have a new. Personal degree size, which is the Max of all of those. So it's it's the Max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the number of people that you recruit as given by the the network structure. And like I said the the last one was from a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not, I'm not super worried about it and we have these things we have these suspicious. This variable so we can we can what I'm trying to say is like we can we can remove the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat and that's that's that's fine. OK so that's that implementing the free hand and so so that's just electricity at this point like it's just it's it's done and and again the the. Estimates are very, very consistent. Between 30 and 40%, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me that's shockingly high. But it's it's very consistent. So in some I'm I'm working on the bootstrap is working and I'm almost done with the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff, so we need this the size of the frame. So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year. We needed that for the the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that the the preferred number. Thanks to you Caroline with 980,000 I think something like that came from. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And again I've I've. Standed out I I I use. I use sample frame sizes from 10/10 thousand 100,009 to 980 thousand 1.5 million just again for robustness I should probably add because I think one of the I don't know what it was called. I threw it down the there are these two occupational. Classes that you used Caroline from and, and one of them was like spot on and then the other one was. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Was plausible, but So what I'm trying to say I should I should use. So currently the preferred model uses the sum of those two numbers, but I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Think so too? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I I should and that's fine. I'm happy to report that everything. But again for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated whatever, so that's that's. That's what I do now. The pro bolsters, so we need to know this. We only have one, and that's the number of people you know who have been referred to the national referral mechanism or whatever it's called in our in our. So we have that question. And we thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people. In the UK, like we, we know the size. Of that group. And so I'm trying rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame which we needed from before, and there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the end sum, we also need the size of these pro bolter groups, so I'd I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. It just sort of just sort of adds. Some complexity to it adds noise really to these estimators, so I haven't done that. There's gonna be more electrons, more electrons to use. So the right pro Balter group that was the other pop size, and I told you about the weird this thing with the people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry. Don't know how to count. And that's where I'm at. So sorry I didn't I. Again, I'm sorry I was. Coding furiously, hoping I could get it done before 3. But then I I. I thought I I didn't know how to read my calendar, so sorry about that. So. So that's where the update on my end date is. 

Speaker 3 

I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress and I there's a question is what do you need from us? 

Speaker 2 

So I think I think we're we're good to. Electrons. That's fine, I think. I think we're ready for uh. Then you discussing where we want to submit it and slim were we able to did the Zotero references work for you? I don't know. I sent one good. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So I'm trying to say I think I think we're we're into like once all my batches running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you know, writing up the results. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that works fine. It works. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Inclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. OK, that sounds fantastic. So in terms of journal targets and then the question is. I suppose within the Business School, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list the it's like an association of business schools journal quality list with the the school. 

Speaker 2 

With ABS, sorry maintenance. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Signed up to the Dora principles, that it's not all about journal destination, but it is a a factor, so one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal targets. Is that list. OK. Well I tend to publish anywhere that so I have not really been following the rules very strictly and and I don't know what. Your publication targets might look like and so I'm quite happy to be ecumenical about this and not necessarily pick a journal off that list just because that's what you're supposed to do. But but having said that. There is one journal potentially, which is a three star Journal, so it's not absolutely top quality, but it's reputable called work, employment and society. 

Speaker 2 

Work with them in society, OK? 

Speaker 3 

Which has a strong theoretical basis. So I I don't know whether well that would mean that I would need to do some background work on. They definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's it's sort of sociologically focused. And and the advantage is one of the editor in chief is actually marrick causes. Who is? Yeah, who's obviously at the Business School. So I could sound him out and just say would you accept her? Sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated paper in the domestic works? 

Speaker 2 

I got them, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Is that something that you think might fall within the scope of the journal? So that that was the target that sort of occurred to me. But I'm very open to publishing where it would suit you, Scott. 

Speaker 2 

I mean I I think the ABS list is a great place to start because I know nothing about this this field at at all. But it sounds like, I mean, yeah, more more stars is better in general for for for me, but but at the same time like I'm not like you, Caroline. Like I'm not. I'm not picky about these things. But you know. My general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down to yours as the rejection letter just come in, which in my case they they fill up my mailbox so that would be yeah. So I mean ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Appropriate for, you know, labor domestic work. You pay human rights, whatever and start there and yeah, and work our way down would be I guess one other thing I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important is. So the strategy I. Just. Articulated is. Is A is a lengthy process so. So I guess we should talk about timeline. Are there are people going for promotion or jobs or other are there are is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or? 

Speaker 3 

I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know how does that sound for you. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Again, I'm. I'm. I'm, I'm. I'm OK taking time and doing the the start high. And when's the next do we know when the rough cycle ends? I don't I don't know when is it. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's REF 2029 now, but when the actual. Not ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline is for paper submissions is I don't know. But I mean 24, we're we've got a few. We've got enough time to try a higher journal. Yeah. And then knock down to it. So I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars if you think we'd like to start with that. 

Speaker 2 

That would be my preference if that's. If if there's. 

Speaker 3 

Right. OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that would be my preference. I I like like you. I don't. I don't have time constraints. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Well, I mean, there's somewhere like the British Journal of. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view, a bit of a quantitative bias, so that might work in our favor and I can have a bit of a search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But it, I mean, the fact that it's UK statistics. Might be quite appropriate for them. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

We just, we just might might need to sort of cite it in their literature. To to sort of see what debates they're they're talking about. So that that's a bit of. Work for me to do. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

And and then, yeah, see what I mean? I asked our Dean and Alex talked about this associating and and he suggested research policy and science. OK, neither of those journals. I know anything about. I did look at the. The. Aims and scope and to me. Didn't seem to fit, but that was his initial suggestion. I don't know if you know anything about science that's an American. 

Speaker 2 

Science is absolutely tough, but I did. Yeah, it's a strange fit. I would. I would, I think of them as doing more like biology, kinds of stuff. Basically what they do is like really, really. 

Speaker 3 

You wouldn't say that. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

High profile stuff. Regardless of field and so maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is is is high profile maybe. But yeah, it strikes me as an odd as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you, I've heard of. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Yeah. I you don't think about research policy? 

Speaker 2 

No, but I think policy sounds like a good a good class of journals to maybe target, although we don't really. Have any policy implications? Currently but but. 

Speaker 3 

But could that could be strengthened? Perhaps. Yeah, that that brings to mind. Another journal called Milbank Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're AB BS. That's possible from a policy point of view. But maybe British Journal of Management is better. 

Speaker 

Excellent. 

Speaker 3 

That's yeah. So and then, I suppose work, employment and society. If we fail with BJM is like at the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. 

Speaker 2 

Perfect. Good, excellent. Excellent. That's great. That's great. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

Does that sound all right? 

Speaker 2 

Sounds great for me. 

Speaker 3 

So if I do a bit of a a literature search that the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until April and I've got seminar weeks coming up so and my diary is absolutely chock block. So the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days I think I could perhaps spend some time. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine. 

Speaker 3 

And actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well, so. I can do make a start on that. Then. And then so at least get you sort of some indication and? Yeah, but we I think this general management does seem to be quite a good fit and that's that's a good journal. If we get into that. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. Let's let's start there. Let's start there. I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week because like you, the. The next two to three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff, but reading week has been good and I'm making so I I'm gonna make a push to try to get, you know. The the results done. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team's gone. It's really, really, really, really great, so. 

Speaker 2 

It's been fantastic working with both of you, so thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So it would be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah, if we were to aim to do that for the summer, yeah. Is that too? No. Is that alright? I think by the time we sort of tidied everything up. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yep, I. 

Speaker 3 

And and then. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, June, I think is a good target and July would be good if we miss. You know, I think that's that's I think it's very feasible as well. I mean like I said the. 

Speaker 3 

And. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Right. So if April will will? Be able to come back to it and Polish and then you know. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I'm hoping next term won't be quite as bad as this term, but I'll have a little bit. We'll be just marking that. 

Speaker 2 

The finance or registered for you? 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. 

Speaker 2 

It doesn't end. It just never ends. It just. Never ends so. But OK, this is great. I'm going to I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll e-mail you with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the I'm not expecting any surprise. So the RDS stuff is done done and then the. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes. 

Speaker 2 

Some. I don't know. I'm. I'm. I'm not expecting to be surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. 

Speaker 3 

To see. Fantastic. Really. Really good that you wanted to. 

Speaker 1 

I have two. 

Speaker 3 

This. 

Speaker 1 

Two points. First, Doctor Moser, do you have anything that you need from my side other than to sort your references? Is there anything else? 

Speaker 2 

That's. 

Speaker 1 

And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We start with speak bot. You may have seen my e-mail that I don't want to be included in the publication for for this research. What do you think about them? 

Speaker 2 

I I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your to your PhD advisor to Doctor Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need if you wanna stay academic, you need publications and and in the past you've mentioned sort of wanting to. Fortify your quantitative credentials and this would certainly help with that. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I I mean I I think I understand his point. I understand his point. It's something like branding. Like you don't want to get labeled as something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just you need publications and full stop. So I I. 

Speaker 1 

That one from Doctor Randall. I have to say it's not from Doctor. It's from the mentor in the in the US. When I spent time there because I'm still having meetings with the professor there and he is also the Dean of the Department for International Relations and Politics. And recently we had another meeting. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. I see. 

Speaker 1 

And he told me. It would be not good if I have a profile that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that and I. And I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but I mean it it. 

Speaker 1 

Don't include my name is Risa. 

Speaker 2 

It one it's your decision. And of course I completely I completely respect that. And I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was doctor little you you might run by him then in that case get his opinion because he's, you know proper IR theory person and. 

Speaker 1 

That that's funny. 

Speaker 2 

And see what have you. Have you discussed it with him? 

Speaker 1 

No, we'll meet on Tuesday, so I will raise this up then. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. But I was saying to silly. We could perhaps acknowledge him in if if he's if he's sure that he doesn't want to be included in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I I just wanna. But perhaps it was an idiosyncrasy of the American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would. 

Speaker 

Of course. 

Speaker 3 

Just caution you to find out, Celine, whether it's an he's talking from an American perspective with that. The same applies in Europe if that's where you want to. To end up. 

Speaker 1 

All my supervisors are American thing to do is protect people other than you, Caroline. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. But but yeah, for sure. I mean I think sort of the the bottom line is is it's your decision of course. And I think I can speak truthfully to say that like you've definitely contributed a lot and I I I think you, yeah, you deserve to be credited in, in in some way and and thank you. I mean you've you've done. You've you've done a lot to to to help with the project, so. Yeah. So thank you. 

Speaker 1 

Take you too, that I could learn from both of you, and I still have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will. I will update you both after I speak to my first supervisor, doctor and. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, OK. Brilliant. Thanks. Then. Yeah. Do we need another date? Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on the e-mail from now on? 

Speaker 2 

Thanks everyone. Have a great weekend. Yeah, I think he most probably good April was probably, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. OK, right. That's super. Let let's stick with that then. Thanks very much. Bye bye bye. 

Speaker 2 

Thanks everyone. Have a great weekend. Bye bye. 

 

## Voice026_sdCE20231110.txt
I can't. I came on last Saturday. Okay.
Hello.
Good afternoon, everybody. How are you?
Good.
Hi. Good to see you.
And you.
Yeah, go ahead, please, Caroline. I'm not prepared.
Yeah, I was going to say, thank you for your email. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking.
It's just a way of trying to keep an aid memoir, isn't it?
Of where we're up to with this, really. So it was really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought.
Yeah, I think so.
We might have a path forward from what you're saying.
Yeah, honestly, that sounds really good.
I had to write everything down because I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that email.
Yeah. No, I'll keep talking while you're looking for it.
Please, thank you.
And interestingly, the Norck paper that you mentioned in it, I think that that is the first of two studies that they've done.
Okay. And we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I shared with you was the second study they've done a cohort study.
So now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional, but we've tried to track down both reports.
Small world, yeah.
But I think we know what they're publishing anyway, and that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the Gile, is it Gile?
Yeah.
But I will read that. And that will be useful for just putting the literature related to RDS together.
Yeah, I think so.
And Selim has done a fantastic job, I think, in actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started.
So I think we've made some pretty good progress this week.
Good.
So I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings.
Yes.
Like that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the email, Scott?
Or do you want to chat with them?
Chat about the risk assessment?
Yeah, if you don't mind, please do. I'm so sorry. Yeah, so sorry, please, please.
Now, we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then.
Right.
So what I tried to do, Selim, as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right, but there are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally.
And Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning weight so that overall they would add up to one.
That's effectively an index of no exploitation through to every form of exploitation we could think of.
And we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there may be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process.
But from what you're saying in your emails, Selim, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation.
Yeah, that's right. So I have gone through these steps that you have sent me in your email last Friday, and they all, 97 people, you know, so we have some level of exploitation.
And if you go to the Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night, you can see when you go to the column, some categories, so you can see that 0.366, 0.2, 0.1, and that continues.
And as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13 categories that we have asked our respondents.
Yeah, so the question that I had, and forgive me if I misunderstood this, but we, when we put the measures together, there were some that were sort of composite measures.
So there were the 13 sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement, where there were two or three together.
So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding, Selim, or have you just done a sort of all or nothing coding?
I've done all or nothing coding. So is this the, I mean, I didn't attend last week the meeting. Is this a complication then?
Well, this is, I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this input.
I mean, definitely, you've answered the first question was how many people in the sample experienced any form of exploitation and we know.
Because of the way we've selected organisations to approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation, and not just generic people working in the sector.
So that I think is good for our clarity of our method.
And I suppose the question is, could we, or do we want to, do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got?
Because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've designed the measures is just purely a cumulative sum.
But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub-totals almost.
I have a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run.
I'm sorry.
How you, how you sort of conceptualise the risk index?
First cup of coffee, so apologies to all, but I'm not exactly, so I see there's what 13 categories, is that right? Some number of categories.
13 categories, and saline's, for each person, saline's indicated the extent to which they fit in that category.
And the categories in the Word document are, oh I see, the categories aren't individual questions, they're compilations of questions.
Is that correct?
In some cases.
In some cases.
It's not always, we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have.
Okay, and then, so sorry, give me a second.
So Saline, how did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet?
So Caroline sent me the email, I think you have been also included in the same email, so I'm just, I think I'm just sharing it, this will solidify the communication.
Can you see that?
Yeah, that's exactly what I have, yeah.
Yeah, so I, so going back to the question, let's start here.
For example, this would be category one, yeah, category one, and we have our question, and for that question we have more answers in this survey.
We don't have only yes, always, often, or sometimes there's also no, never, and so on.
So, but as long as they answer one of these responses, they have been forced to do work against their will.
Right.
Back to the question.
And that will be done, weighted with 0.25.
Yeah.
What do you mean weighted by 0.25?
So it's like 0.25 times 0.025.
0.025.
So that's a proportion of the total index of one. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk, so that there was a sort of cumulative effect.
So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding, silly correctly, when you look at risk category one, silly, that was designed to be those two questions together.
Yeah.
And you see, because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability.
Yeah.
So that would give you a composite weighting.
So if you answered the first question, and in any of those responses, you get 0.25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further 0.25.
Just make 0.05.
Yeah.
Yeah, just what I have done.
Yeah.
So as Karen and I said, we have your two questions.
And if the respondent, our respondent has responded for both of these questions, then they will get a weighting for each 0.025.
And some of this would be, for this question, 0.05. And that continues.
So for all questions, so here, for example, would be, again, 0.05. Here we have, again, two questions.
So it will be 0.025, 0.025.
If they have been part of that indicator for exploitation, then they will get a weighting of 0.05.
And this goes back to the beginning.
So Caroline has let weighting for all our questions in a way that is first 0.35, 0.55.
And at the bottom is also 0.10.
So in total, this makes them one.
Yeah.
So that's what I sort of entered from our conversation last week, Scott.
Yeah.
That's what I creatively designed.
Gotcha.
Thank you.
I'm hoping that I've interpreted it properly.
Right.
And then, yes, and then the, I don't know what you want to cook.
So hang on.
So it's category one.
So I don't want to, I don't know how to describe this to the different.
So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't.
And I just want to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you, you've selected those weights, not 0.35 for category 13.
Yeah.
And you've done that on a qualitatively done on the basis of the extent to which you did indicate exploitation, serious exploitation.
So that we've got the middle block that saline's got on the screen where those are all indicators of forced labor risk.
And there's a sort of cumulative effect.
So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk.
And so I've allowed, there were about 11 of those indicators.
So it just made sense sort of mathematics or arithmetic lead to get a total of 0.55.
By assigning this, these smaller weights to each composite measure.
In addition to that, we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is a more objective measure of exploitation, because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that person is experiencing exploitation.
So we've only got one question on that.
But actually that's a stronger indicator because it applied. It's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that 0.35 on its own.
So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing exploit.
One, which is this, I wanted a point one.
So this is payment below the national living wage.
So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be, it could be a exploitation, but it isn't always.
So that's why I've waited at a lower level.
So I could make a narrative argument for why I put those weightings in.
But there's some convenience in making sure that they will add up to one.
Yeah.
But there is some sort of logic behind it.
Yeah, that's great.
So then just few more questions if I can.
So the.
So category 12 is this is like you were saying is like the suggestive, but not definitive indicator.
But it gets a weight of not point one, which is twice the weight of say, category 11.
Right.
So why that confuses me is if it's if if if category 12 is the loosest, wouldn't we down weight it relative to the other categories.
With the other indicator, it can be illegal.
I suppose this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially illegal exploitation.
That's true.
It's true.
Okay.
Whereas excessive overtime.
Yeah.
Not necessarily illegal.
Okay.
I agree it's arguable.
No, no, but I just, it's fine.
It's fine.
I'm understanding all the, all the, the, the not point fives and sorry, not point not fives.
Excuse me.
And so, so all the category, no, that's not true.
All the categories in the middle block get not point not five.
Yeah.
11 indicators of forced labor and for each indicator, it's not point 05.
And that's where the not point five five comes from is because you're okay.
Good.
And in category 13, it's, it's weighted, it stated it's weighted at not point three five,
but it's also stated it's weighted at not point four.
No, it is, isn't it?
That's true.
Which one of those is wrong?
So, which one did you use?
Did you use the point three five?
I've done that.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's a typo.
That's no problem.
That's no problem.
That's great.
Thank you.
So thank you.
So now I understand this.
So, so now, now I'm able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is,
if I'm understanding it, do you, do you want to combine categories?
Is that what you're, so for example, we have, um, go, sorry, sorry.
I think Salim's done it.
I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these
13 categories.
I'm right on time.
Salim, you have done it that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we have to get the questions, the indica, the quite, yeah, which is the indicators
into those questions.
Good.
Okay.
And we're I'm totally comfortable with that.
Is that is, do we need any other aggregation category?
Sorry.
Sorry.
I apologize to interrupt.
Caroline, do you mean death on the sum category?
No, I'm happy with exactly.
I, I'm, I'm happy with what you've done.
I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures,
but we do.
So that's perfect.
Good.
Okay.
Good. Okay. I'm happy with that. If you all are, I think that's, I think that's great.
Good. Good. So, and then for each of these, we get, there's some distribution of this risk, which is great. No problem. Good. Good.
And there's no, there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level. Is there, so for example, combine categories. That's what I understood your question to be Caroline.
But now I see, I'm mistaken. That's not what you were saying. So, sorry.
You mean if there was evidence of low payment and forced labor and NRM. I mean, we've got that in the summation, haven't we?
Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just, you would just, if you wanted higher levels of irrigation, you just add up those categories on their own. Yep. Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good.
Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it. So that's great.
Yeah, in a week as well. So thank you Salim.
Yeah. Well done. Well done.
I've done it. I've done it. Yes.
It's, it's, it looks great. Like I said, this is totally spot on or looking for.
I was seeing Caroline have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. It's weight with 0.4. So I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.35.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sorry. That's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't.
I just have to change whoever is written 0.04 to 0.35 and then just take everything together. It shouldn't take long.
And it's only category 13. So it's, it's, yeah, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be too bad.
It will impact some category.
Yeah, that's right. Category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great. Good. Good. Good.
I still can't find the email. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to, well, I gotta get more coffee. Sorry.
Okay. Okay.
See if I can share my screen.
Thanks.
Yeah, we can see it.
Can you see it? Yeah.
So we've talked about the papers and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that.
Right. So I started playing around. So one, so the, the trimming. So, yeah, so boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee.
Okay. On point one, there's, there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So,
RDS, the, usually what's done is your, your sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz, but everybody in your sample is, is, is in the population.
And the objective is to calculate the size. It's a size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a, I mean, there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit.
And one of them is, and I don't know why they came up with this because, but it's great for us is, is a proportion estimate.
So you could say, okay, here's this, here's this hidden populace. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population.
And you want to know something about covariate. So for example, you want to know the HIV status among IV drug users.
So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you want to know, you want to know a proportion that are HIV positive say.
So the point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us, it's, are you exposed? So here's take one, take one is there's some indicator, or there's 12 indicators, whatever.
And we, so what I'm trying to say is, is the, the, if we consider our popular, our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being,
are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside, not withstanding, but as a way, then off the shelf methods, we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have, have this trait that are experiencing
the NMS. So why is that sneaky? That's sneaky. So that's straightforward we can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame that we think are experiencing this.
So it's, it's kind of a clever statistical trick where my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually want to know the answer to, and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer, but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in.
I think, I think this kind of fits in that category. So, so I take it as good news though, like I said, I mean, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is, is different from us than the RDS world is we, we have extra we have based on other sources we have
estimates, I think, of, like, for example, the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think, if so, then we can do, I mean, estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear but if so then we could, I'm trying to say we could, we could, we could, we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward,
very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone, then we can, we can, we can gin up a size estimate.
That's pretty cool, I think, so that's, that's, that's one thing. And that requires like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon, like, well, yeah, I could do that this afternoon requires very, very little, little, little work. I mean, like I said,
the uncertainty estimates is going to be a bear, but we'll have to figure that that that's that. Now the risk. Actually, I progress since I wrote this email.
So what I've been describing it is there's, there's like a zero one, your, your, your HIV positive or you're not, but turns out that the same methods actually apply for continuous variable so we can do exactly the same thing with the risk index.
Here the news is not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what, what's the quantity of interest here because so normally we were what we're going to know the size of such and such but with the risk index is that we don't, I don't think
and correct me if I'm wrong, we don't care about like the total.
We don't want a number, we don't want like the sum of everyone's risk indexes. I don't think I think instead of what we want is a distribution we want to know in the population how is this risk distributed are there lots of people with high value, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So that that would be ideally what we want. And I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that they'll give us numbers and confidence intervals.
So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is lots of these you're going to hate me.
So lots of these RDS methods that have been playing with our, our, our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything anybody if not no problem.
Not much.
Absolutely no problem. So, so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistics. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or confidence interval or whatever you can do hypothesis testing.
Great, go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics called Bayesian in which Bayesian say, well, so let me put it differently. So in the frequencies world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population.
We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great.
And Bayesian say, no, there's no six things. Truth doesn't exist. There's only belief and data. And I, the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should adjust your beliefs in the presence of data.
Okay, so why do I, why am I prattling prattling on about this. I'm prattling on about this because in the Bayesian world, what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing.
What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval, it's a shape.
It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in the, in our world, it would be not a size of the hidden population would be a distribution of how hard of our beliefs about the size of the hidden population.
I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. Okay, it's really weird. I mean, it's a very, they're two very, very different ways of thinking about the world and learning from data, basically.
Is it a sort of variability graph? Is that what you would produce?
What you would produce is, is a distribution saying for each value, how likely, how, how confident are we, the analyst, that the size of the hidden population is 8,500.
There's some, there's some belief, there's some probability that we have that the, the size of the hidden population is 8,500 people.
And there's some belief or some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9,500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every, for everything.
Okay. So, so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out a distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions.
So the treacherous bit is we, if we use these Bayesian methods to this RDS risk thing, what we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the, not a, not a distribution of the risk indices,
but a distribution for our beliefs about the total, the sum of the risk indices.
So that's what I'm saying is a little treacherous. Like we, it's a bit like before, we could force a distribution, but it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in.
It's like, it's kind of like the difference between a distribution, a sample distribution, like, so you've got a bunch of X's and you can plot those, or you could plot sample means.
You could take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not, and they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing.
And so, so that's, that's what I'm proposing is sort of a, is like that is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not.
I'm kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a, there's one more paper I need to read to before I rule out the, but, but I mean, I think, I mean, I think, I think I see what we need and I don't, I'm not aware of methods that do that because we want essentially we want, we want a different
network than features of the network that people usually study. Right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always prevalence, size, what have you, and we that's fine, but we want other features of, of the network, like the distribution of this continuous
covariate across across the network.
It's like a one step removed like the mean is as a measure of the song or population, then the belief is a measure of confidence.
I'm not really expressing it very well.
And so that's what exactly, exactly. And that's why it's treacherous because we get the, we get the, we get distribution, but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses the variables whose distribution we do want to come up with this thing.
So, I don't really know it's like I said, it's, it's a bit of mental gymnastics and at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one, there's one other paper I need to check.
Bear with me in that work distribution.
And please correct me if I'm wrong.
If you've either, you know, anything about, you know, Caroline last week he corrected me when I was, and that was wonderful or two weeks ago, whatever it was, but that was great. So, so hopefully I'm.
So anyway, so, so, so point two is kind of a mix, I guess I don't really don't really know what to make of point two.
Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward Dubona has this idea of Poe, doesn't he? And to me this seems like a Poe.
What's Poe?
Poe, it's a, it's a, well, I think about it as a possibility. It could be, this could be possible, but we're sort of holding it up as a possibility rather than a definite something that we know we can do.
So it's an opportunity to engage in this case in discussion.
Oh, I see. I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right.
I don't remember what point three was if there was a point three. I don't. Sorry, I don't remember.
Let me see if I can scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see my screen.
Oh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you.
Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it. Again, I've made some, I've made more progress since I wrote this email, but they're, yeah, they keep,
laptop, yeah, keep crashing. So I've had to switch a bit, but I'm making some progress on that, which is, which is, which is good. Oh, right. And then four, right, right. So then,
so I'm, I'm, I'm, I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two, and, and three is sort of ongoing, which is, which is great.
But then, you know, there's a sense in which this is all we've sort of strayed in a sense, and this is not a criticism of anybody.
This is not a criticism of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. Sorry.
Oh, that was great. Yeah. Lovely. Friday.
Apologies for that.
We sort of strayed in the following sense, at least when I started working with you all, which is awesome.
We're working from the, within the in some literature and trying to use G some and Feehan and all this and, and we've totally straight away from that right this is we're not the techniques that we're describing here don't don't don't scale anything up.
And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data. And, you know, we have the possible.
We could do scale up it's just we don't have this representative sample and that so we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the those. So normally, non random sampling, sort of, how do I say this,
the concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But, but here that's not the case the, the, the, the sampling.
The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people for who are if you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers and other people, then,
it makes sense that your, your, your, your estimate of the count is going to be is going to be off. Okay. Right. So what, so what.
So I was thinking, like, well, okay, we can do one, two and three, but we're sort of relieved. Yeah, we've straight from the flock from the, we've straight from the initial, and we're sort of leaving a lot of juicy information on the table so there's there's
any way that we can, that we can do this and this is where I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this but I think there's a way that I think we can.
So, so what I'm trying to say is, I think we can combine the two. So I think I see how, again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear but the idea is basically you use the ideas from RDS to create to
to use the ideas of RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection.
And I tried to write down the details at least enough that would remind me of where to go in the in the future but it's, it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the fian and Saul and sort of gluing them together and praying.
Absolutely fantastic.
We'll see.
But yeah, I think things were trying to circle in a way.
This is what we were hoping that we would start with start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because this won't work because this won't.
And now, possibly, there's a glimmer.
And I mean, another nice, I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree is that what I'm proposing here is, we'll get, you know, oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see
if is their consistency is there not is there because we will have all these different methods, you know, to throw at this problem and personally I think that's a, I think it's informative.
Either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates that's reassuring a certain sense. And if they don't that's informative that's telling you something about about this so I think, you know, that opinion is not universal
and is not without the tractors but I'm, I'm, I think, I think that's on balance I think that's good news so that's my report, which isn't really really exciting so that that's fantastic if we think that we might be able to circle back to real estate
using some of the end to sell great. Yeah, that's great. That's that's the idea. That's the idea. Yeah, I mean, yeah, let me say I'll try it out the, I'll try it out. I'll try it out.
Yeah.
And I suppose our, our ground our foundation is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so even if this more advanced work doesn't reveal what we want it to we've got a
Yeah, and we're talking about originally about that, what we really wanted was some sort of estimate for this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. Yeah, again with the caveat which is,
I don't know if it's good or bad but it's an important caveat that the thing that we're estimating is a proportion and not account. Yeah, yeah with that with that caveat we're solid we're very, very solid.
Brilliant. Now I was reading a paper which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up.
And yeah, that's, that's great. I mean this I'm going to ask a really stupid question now.
If we have a proportion, and we have an estimator of the total population size. Can we not produce a scale up. Exactly. So that's right it's exactly so that we absolutely can't say what if we like if we want a number, we can produce a number.
There's two.
So here's a con the pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of because, you know, one sample. I mean, again, no distraction from anybody is anything but more information the better so if there's other sources of of data that we can incorporate
this the pro the con is reflecting uncertainty in that world.
I have to think about, because
unless we had like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then, then there's uncertainty in that estimate and I, it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty.
If it's possible, I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee.
But yeah, exactly. If you if we, if we, if we want a number we can get a number.
Now, just be, yeah, it wouldn't be that confidence is something. Yeah, it would be tough to. Yeah, it'll just be, and we could just report that I mean we could just say look here's here's the, here's the estimate.
There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty and we can for the other and here's it would just be a front of it and say, you know, or even more straightforward.
Here's our point estimate and because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry, so I take it or leave it, you know.
Yeah, yeah.
You tell me, Caroline, from like a policy perspective or impact perspective is, I would think that a proportion would be.
I mean, I know like, at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from my home office is that at the government level they do want numbers they want counts but it.
I would think that a proportion would be of abuse.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at the moment at the moment we've just got descriptive statistics. So to have a proportion is a real step forward.
That's great. I will, yeah, I will get another couple I will do that this afternoon.
That would be fantastic. Yeah.
That's really really good. Do you need anything more from us?
I mean, you write my lecture slides for for next week, please. That's the number one thing I need.
Seriously, but that's no no well.
Celine, please just share when you get the category 13 thing fixed up which is, I'm not worried about it.
Just send it around again and I'll, I will do it after the meeting.
That's great. That's great. And shouldn't take long. No, it shouldn't and I will.
I'll do the, I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon at least I'll, I'll, I'll try to and see, see what comes out.
And then I'm afraid I'm going to have to park it again because teaching is going to be horrible.
But I think we've really made some good progress here. And I've got, I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft up.
I'm making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using. So I want to consolidate that into a draft and I can share that with you.
That's a great idea.
So that'll be a couple of weeks time.
No rush. No rush on my end.
So that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. I think we're in a position where we can start to do that.
I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think, I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really if I, I mean, I don't know this literature as well as you all do, but, but it seems like there's a possibility to make a real contribution.
I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity.
It's good. Yeah.
Yeah, really good.
Right. Well, given that you've got lectures, I'm not proposing to detain you.
Only longer than we have to. And slim was anything else from your side that we needed to cover today.
This, I mean, there's just the category 13. Yeah, that I'm sorry about that.
I have also more attention. So I will just be not the category 13 and then recalculate the sound category and then shared with suppose of you.
Yeah, is there anything else that I can help with?
Let me I'm just looking at the.
Right. No, it's as long as I've got the node one, the node two, that that's important. No, it looks like the what's weather exploitation.
You've mentioned the email.
I'm sorry.
Because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited.
Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some form of reverie. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
So they are all exploited.
Gotcha.
Right.
Which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got the note. Yep. Nope.
Right.
Oh, well, there is one of them. I think we've already covered it. And that is, what are the if I'm going to do that. Yeah, there is one very important thing.
Thank you for, thank you for that, Caroline.
It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think a set would be great, but which if I wanted to dichotomize and say, yes, you're in experiencing minor slavery. No, you're not.
What questions plural, what are you, what question should I use? And if there's one of the one question that's fine, which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM seems like a pretty gold standard.
Yeah, that's cool. So the good and the forced labor ones as well are more indicative of forced one slavery. It's that last, the point one one, which is a potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labor, not necessarily modern slavery.
So you probably exclude people who had just that indicator.
It could be exploited. It's labor exploitation, but it isn't.
It isn't modern slavery. Okay. And that's Q365B1.
And so I should use that one and the NRM.
Question mark.
Yeah, the NRM is definitely well as definitely as you can be. Yeah, yeah.
Modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. Yeah, good point. And it's a time to get anything else. Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable?
Not that I can think of, Salim. Have you got anything you want to mention?
I'm looking at the document. I don't think so. Okay, great.
Thanks for my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. Okay. Thanks. As always, everyone.
Yeah, do you want to meet next week or when do you want to catch up again?
Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so sorry.
What's the next ride, isn't it?
For the next two weeks, until the 22nd, I might be not rainbow because my annual review is coming up.
Okay.
I'm in the process of putting everything together.
Right. Okay. Now that's fine.
It might be as well to have, well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again probably at the beginning of December.
When is your annual review?
On the 28th.
28th, so the beginning of December.
29th or 29th of November.
Any day after that.
Right. Okay.
First of December.
Is that a Friday again? Yeah.
Let me find my calendar too.
Sorry about that. Fire alarm business.
Oh, okay. So we're suggesting Scott, perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the first of December.
That works. Just if you don't mind sending me a team to invite that would be great.
Yeah. And I'm 12 o'clock. Is that still a good time?
Yeah, I'm flexible. So whatever.
If another time works better for you all that's that's fine for me.
Well, Charles, all right for me. What about you, Salim?
11 or 12 this time.
Okay, let's go for 11 and I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft.
So, probably the week before, whatever stage it's in, I'll circulate it.
And then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well.
Great. Sounds great. Thanks everyone.
Right. Good. Good to speak to you.
And you all have a nice weekend.
Yeah, me too.
Talk to you later.
Thank you. Bye.

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

And I came on last Saturday. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Hello, docomo. 

Speaker 3 

Hello, good afternoon everybody. How are you? 

Speaker 2 

Hi, good to see you. 

Speaker 

And you. 

Speaker 2 

I would. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, go ahead, please. Caroline, I'm not prepared. So. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I was gonna say thank you for your e-mail. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking. It's just a way of trying to keep an aide memoir, isn't it? Of of where we're up to with this, really. So it's really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. 

Speaker 2 

We might, we might have a path forward. From what you're saying. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, honestly, I I had to write everything down cause I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that e-mail, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That sounds really good. Yeah. No. And I keep talking while you're looking for it. So interestingly, the Nook paper that you mentioned in it, I think that there that is the first of two studies that they've done and we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I showed with you was the second study. 

Speaker 3 

Please. Thank you. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

They should have done a cohorts study. And so now we've got. Both, so that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional that we've managed to track down both. 

Speaker 3 

Reports small world. Yeah, but. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think we know what we're where they're where they're publishing anyway and so that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the the guile. Is it guile? You pronounce her surname. But I will read that and that will be useful for just putting the literature review related to RDS together. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. And then. 

Speaker 2 

Selim has done a fantastic job of thinking actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started. So I think we've made some, some pretty good progress this week. So I, I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings. So that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the e-mail, Scott? Would you want to chat with them? Chat about the risk assessment and everything? 

Speaker 3 

Still can't find it. Yeah, if you don't mind. Please do. I'm so sorry. I. Yeah, so sorry. Please. Please. 

Speaker 2 

Now we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then, right. So what I tried to do, slim as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right. There are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally, and Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning a weight so that overall they would add up to 1. So we had effectively an index of of. No exploitation through to in every form of exploitation we could think of. And and we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there might be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process. But from what you're saying in your e-mail system, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. So I have, I have gone through gone through these steps that you have sent me in your e-mail last Friday and they all 97 people. You know, so you have some level of exploitation and if you go to the? Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night. You can see when you go to. The column some categories so you can see that 0.3660.20.1 and that continues so and as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13. Categories that we have asked our respondents. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So the question that I had and forgive me if I. Misunderstood this, but we when we put the the measures together, there was some that were sort of composite measures. So there, there would be thirteen sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement where there were two or three together. So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding slim or have you just done a a sort of all or nothing coding? 

Speaker 1 

I've done it all on nothing coding, so is this the? I mean I didn't. I can't. Last week the the meeting that you had, it is it's just a complication then. 

Speaker 2 

Well, this is I. I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this we've got. I mean definitely you've answered the first question was that how many people in this sample we experienced any form of exploitation and we know. Because of the way we've selected organizations. To approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation and not just generic. People working in the sector. So that I think. Is good for our the clarity of our method. And and I suppose the question is, could we or do we want to do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got, because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've. Design the measures is it is just purely A cumulative sum. But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub. Totals almost. I suppose that's a question for Scott in terms of what we can do. When we run. 

Speaker 3 

Little, I'm sorry. 

Speaker 2 

How how are you? No. How you how you sort of conceptualize the risk index? 

Speaker 3 

First cup of coffee, so apologies to all but I'm not exactly so I I see there's what 13 categories. Is that right? Some number of categories? Yeah, 13 categories and celines for each person. Celine indicated the extent to which they. Fit in that category and the categories in the Word document are. Oh, I see the the categories aren't individual questions, they're. Compilations of questions. Is that correct? 

Speaker 2 

In some cases. 

Speaker 3 

In some cases. 

Speaker 2 

It's not always we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And then? So so sorry. Give me a second. So so, so lean. How did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet? 

Speaker 1 

So Caroline sent me the e-mail. I I think you have been. Also including the. Same e-mail so. I'm just. I think I'm just sharing it this slit communication. Can you see? That, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's exactly what I have. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. So I. So going back. To the question. Let's start here. For example, this would be category one, yeah? Category one and we have our question. And for that question, we have more answers in this survey. We don't have only yes, always, often or sometimes. There's also no. But and and so on so, but as long as they answer one of these. Responses they have been forced to do work against their will and back to the question, and that will be done weighted with 0.25. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, and. 

Speaker 3 

What do you mean weighted by 0.2? So it's like 0.25 times. 

Speaker 1 

0.0250.02. 

Speaker 2 

Five. So that's the proportion of the total index of 1. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk so that there was a sort of cumulative effect. So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding silly correctly when you. Look at this category. One silly that was designed to be those two questions together. Yeah. Can you see because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability? Yeah. So. That would give you a composite weighting. So if you answered the first question and in any of those responses you get point nought, 25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further point. Nought, 25, do you use the maximum? 

Speaker 1 

And this makes 0.05. Yeah, yeah, this is what I have done. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's super. So. 

Speaker 1 

As Caroline said, you have your two questions and. If the respondent our ID, our respondent has. Responded for. Responded for both of these questions. Then they will get a waiting for each 0.025 sum this would be. For this question 0.05 and that continues. So for all questions. So for here for example would be again 0.05. Here we have again. Two questions. So it will be 0.0250.025 if they have been out of that. Indicator for exploitation. Then they will get the weighting of 0.05 and this goes back. At the beginning so. Caroline has let waiting for all our questions in a way that pays 1st 0.35. Zero point. 55. And at the bottom. Is also 0.10 so. In total, this makes then one for 100% so percent. 

Speaker 2 

So that's what I sort of interrupt from our conversation last week. Scott, that's what I. Creatively designed and hoping that I've interpreted it properly. 

Speaker 3 

Gotcha. Thank you. Right. And then yes and then the the I don't want. So hang on. So it's category one category. So I don't want, I don't know how to describe this. So the different. So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't and differs across and. Just to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you you've selected those weights, not .35 for for category 13 and you've done that on qualitatively done on the basis of. 

Speaker 2 

I have some. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

The extent to which. You. You. 

Speaker 2 

Which indicates exploitation, serious exploitation, so that we've got that the middle block that Celine's got on the screen where and those are all indications of forced labour risk. And there's a sort of cumulative effect. So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk. 

Speaker 3 

Right it it. 

Speaker 2 

And so I've had allowed there were about eleven of those indicators. So it just made sense sort of mathematic arithmetically to to get a total of .55 those. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks for waiting, waiting. I think it's it. 

Speaker 2 

By assigning this these smaller weights to each composite measure, then in addition to. That we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is more objective measure of exploitation because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that, that person is experiencing expectation. So we've only got one question on that. It's actually that's a stronger indicator because it a flight, it's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that .35 on its own. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing explain. One which is this A which is at .1. So this is payment below the national living wage. So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be. It could be a exploitation, but it isn't always right. So that's why I've waited it at a. Lower level so. I could make a a narrative argument for why I've I've put those weightings in, but there's some convenience in making sure that they all add up to one, but there is some sort of a logic behind it. 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. Yeah. No, that makes. Yeah, that's great. So then just a few more follow up questions if I can. So the the. So category 12 is this is like you're saying, is like the suggestive. But not definitive indicator, but it gets a weight of not .1. Which is twice the weight of say category 11. 

Speaker 2 

It is. 

Speaker 3 

Right. Why that confuses me is is if it's if if if if category the 12 is the. Loosest, wouldn't we? Down. Weight it relative to the other categories. 

Speaker 2 

And with the other indicator, it can be illegal. I suppose that this this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially an illegal exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. OK, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Whereas excessive overtime. It's not necessarily illegal, I I agree, it's arguable. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

No, no. But I just, it's fine. It's fine. I just want. To make sure I'm understanding all the all the the. The not point fives and and sorry not point, not fives. Excuse me? And so so all the category. No, that's not true. All the categories in the middle block get not point not 5. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So there are 11 indicators of force labor and for each indicator, it's nought point nought, 5. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's where the not .55 comes from is because you're OK, good. Just one other question then in category 13. It's it's weighted, it's stated it's weighted at not .35, but it's also stated it's weighted at. Not .4. 

Speaker 2 

No, it is, isn't it? That's true. So one of those is wrong. So then which one did you use? Did you use the .35? 

Speaker 1 

I've done that with 0.35. 

Speaker 3 

OK, that's fine. That's fine. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So that's that's in typo. 

Speaker 3 

That's no problem. That's no problem. That's great. OK. No, no. So thank you. So now I understand this. So. 

Speaker 2 

My bad, OK. 

Speaker 3 

So now I'm. Able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is if I'm understanding it, do you do you want to combine categories? Is that what you're so? For example, we have? No, I said. Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

I think kilian's done it. I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these 13 categories. I'm right, aren't I? Celine? You have done it that way. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you can mind the questions. The yeah, which is. 

Speaker 2 

The indicators into third question. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. And we're, I'm. I'm totally comfortable with that is that? Do we need any other aggregation? 

Speaker 1 

Some some category. Sorry. I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one the same category? 

Speaker 2 

Now I'm happy with exactly I'm I'm happy with what you've done. I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures, but we do. So that's perfect. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. I'm. I'm, I'm. Happy with that if if you all are, I think that's I think that's great. Good, good. So and then for each of these we get, there's some distribution of this risk which is. Great, no problem. Good. Good. And there's no there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level is is there so. So for example combined categories, that's what I understood your question to be, Caroline. But now I say I I'm mistaken, that's not what you were saying. So sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ah, OK. You mean if there was? Evidence of low payment and forced labour and NRN. I mean we've got that in the. Summation, haven't we? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just you would just if you wanted higher levels of validation you would just add up those categories on their own. Yep, Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good. Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it, so that's great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. In a week as well. So thank you, Celine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, well done. Well done. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it yesterday. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's it's it looks great. It's like. I said this. Is totally spot on. We're we're looking for. 

Speaker 1 

What I'm seeing, Carla, I have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. Its weight was 0.4, so I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.3. 

Speaker 2 

Five. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Sorry, that's that's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't and obviously. 

Speaker 1 

I I'm saying so. Probably try. I just have to change whatever. Is written 0.040.35. And then just. Take everything together. This shouldn't take long, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And it's only category 13, so it's it's. Yeah, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't. Be too bad. 

Speaker 1 

It will impact some category but it. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's right, category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great, good, good. I still can't find the e-mail. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to? I get more coffee, sorry. 

Speaker 2 

OK. See if I can. And my screen. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we can't see. 

Speaker 3 

All right. 

Speaker 2 

It can. You see it? Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

N7 OK, papers right. Good. 

Speaker 2 

So we talked about the papers and and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that. 

Speaker 3 

That's. That's cool, right? So I started playing around so one so the the trimming so. Yeah. So uh boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee. OK, on on .1. There's there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So uhm. So. So in RDS the usually what's done is you're you're sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz. But everybody and your sample is is. Is in the in population and the objective is to calculate the size. Is the size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit and one of them is. This, and I don't know why they came up with this because but it's it's great for us is is a proportion estimate. So you could say, OK, here's this here's this hidden populate. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population and you want to know something about covariant. So for example you wanna know the HIV status among. IV drug users. So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you wanna know you wanna know proportion that are HIV positive say so. The point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us it's are you exposed so to to take one take one is there's some indicator. Where there's 12 indicators, whatever. And we So what I'm trying to say is is the. If we consider our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being, have you 01 have? Are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside notwithstanding, but there's a way then. Off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have this trait that are experiencing mass. So why is that sneaky that sneaky? So that's straightforward. We can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame. That we think are experiencing this. So it's kind of clever statistical trick where it might my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually know the. Answer to and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in, and I think this kind of fits in. That category so. So I take it as good news though. Like I said, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is different from us than the RDS world is we. We have ex. We have based on other sources, we have estimates I think. Of like for example the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think if so then we can do I mean estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear. But if so then we could. I'm trying to say is we could we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of. Domestic workers in the UK with the cell phone. Then we can we can. We can gin up a size estimate, so that's pretty cool. I think so. That's that's one thing. And that requires, like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon. Well, yeah, I could do that. This. Afternoon requires very little. Little little work. I mean, like I said, uncertainty estimates is going to be a bare, but we'll have to figure out that now the risk actually progress since I wrote this e-mail. So really I've been describing it is there's there's like a 01 your, your your HIV positive or you're not. But it turns out that the same methods actually applies for continuous variables. So we can do exactly the same thing with the Risk Index now. Here the news is. Not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what's the quantity of interest here? Because so normally we were what we want to know the size of section size, but with the risk index, we don't, I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, we don't. Care about like the total. We don't want a number. We don't want, like the sum of everyone's risk indices. I don't think I think. Instead what we want is the distribution. We want to know in the population. How is this risk distributed? Are there lots of people if I value, etc. Etcetera. So that would be ideally what we'd want and I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that. They'll give us numbers and confidence intervals. So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is. Lots of these. You're gonna hate me. So lots of these RDS methods that I've been playing. With our our. Our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything to anybody if? Not no problem. Bayesian so. 

Speaker 2 

Not much. I heard the term, but I don't know that. 

Speaker 3 

I am absolutely no problem. So so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistic. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or conference interval or whatever you can. Do hypothesis testing. Great, go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics. Like Bayesian, in which? Bayesian, say. Well, so let me put it in. So in the frequentist world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population. We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great. The bayesians say no, there's no such thing as truth. Doesn't exist. There's only belief and data, and I the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should. Adjust your beliefs in the presence of data. OK, so why do I? What am I addling on about this? I'm adding on about this because in the Bayesian world what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing. What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval. It's a shape. It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in in our world it would be not a size of the hidden population, it would be a distribution of how. Of our beliefs about the size of. The hidden population. That makes sense. 

Speaker 2 

I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. 

Speaker 3 

OK. It's it's really weird. I mean it's a very there are two very, very different ways of thinking about. The world and learning from data, basically. 

Speaker 2 

So is it a sort of? A variability graph is that what you would produce. 

Speaker 3 

What you would produce is is a distribution saying for each. Value. How likely? How confident are we the analyst? That the the size of the hidden population is 8500. There's some. There's some belief there's some probability that we have that the the size of hidden population is 8500 people, and there's some belief there's some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every for everything. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out of distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions, so the tractor split is we. If we use these Bayesian method. Leads to this RDS risk thing. What we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the not a distribution of the risk indices, but a distribution. For our beliefs. About the total, the sum of the risk indices. So it's saying a little treacherous, like it's a bit like before we could force a distribution, but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in. It's like the it's kind of like the difference between a sample distribution. So you've got a bunch of X's. And you can plot. Those or you could plot sample means, so take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two different distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not. And they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing. And so that's that's what I'm proposing is sort of. Is like. That is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not. I was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a there's one more paper I. Need to read. To before I ruled out the the. But but I mean, I think it's, I mean I think I think I see what we need and and I don't I'm not aware of methods that that do that. We want essentially we want, we want a different feature of the network than features of the network that people usually study, right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always, yeah. Prevalence size, what have you and that's fine. But we want other features of the network like. The distribution of this continuous covariant across across the network. 

Speaker 2 

It's sort of like a one step removed, like the mean is as as a measure of the. Some or population. Then the belief is a measure of confidence and I'm not really expressing. 

Speaker 3 

Is that the? 

Speaker 2 

It very well. 

Speaker 3 

No, no, you got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. And so that's exactly exactly that's why it's treacherous. Cause we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses. The variables whose. Distribution, we do want to come up with this thing, so. I don't really know. Like I said, it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics. And at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one. There's one other paper I need to check. Bear with me in network distribution. And please correct me if I'm wrong. If either you know anything about, you know Caroline, last week he corrected me when it was. And that was wonderful. Or two weeks ago, whatever it was. But that was great. So. So hopefully I'm. So anyway, so so so .2 is kind of a mix I guess. I don't really. I don't really know what to make of. .2 and I don't remember what point. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward de Bono has this idea of. Poe doesn't he and to? Me this seems like a. Poe, like Poe, it's a it's a. 

Speaker 3 

Wait, what's the code? 

Speaker 2 

Well, I I think about it as a a possibility. It could be it could be possible, but we we're sort of holding. It up as a. A possibility rather than a definite something that we know. We can do. So it's an opportunity to engage in this Bayesian discussion. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh I see, I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't remember. What .3 was, if there was a .3? I don't. Sorry I don't remember. 

Speaker 2 

Let me see if I can Scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see. My screen properly. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you. Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it again. I've made some. I've made more progress since I wrote this e-mail, but they're yeah, they keep. One of my laptop. 

Speaker 2 

I think. 

Speaker 3 

Keeps crash. Yeah, keeps crashing. So I've I've had to switch a bit, but I'm. I'm making some progress on that, which is which is, which is good, right. And then four. Right, right. So then. So I'm I'm I'm I'm. I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great, but then there's a sense in which. This is we sort. Of strayed, in a sense, and this is not a criticism of anybody. This is not a criticism of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh that was great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, lovely. Friday. Apologies for that. We we sort. Of strayed in in the following sense, at least when I. Started working with you all, which again is awesome. We're working from. Within the in some literature and trying to use Gsom and Feehan and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right. The techniques that we're describing here don't scale anything up. And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data and we have the. We could do scale up. It's just we don't have this representative sample and that. So we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the so normally. Non random sampling sort of. How do I say this? The usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But but here that's not the case. The the the, the, the. The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates, but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people. Or who? If you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers than other people, then OK, that sort of makes sense. That your your. Your estimate of the count is gonna be is gonna be OK. Right. So what? So what? So I was thinking like, well, OK, we can do 1-2 and three, but we're sort of we're leaving. Yeah, we've, we've, we've straight from the flock from the we're straight from the initial. And we're sort. Of we're leaving a lot of juicy information on the table, so is there. Is there any way that we can do this? And this is where. I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this, but I think there's a way that. I I think we can. So sorry, what I'm trying to say is. I think we can combine the two, so I and I think I see how. Again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear, but the idea is. Basically you use the ideas from RDS to. Use the ideas of. RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection. And I tried to write. Down the details, at least enough that would remind me of of of where to go in the future. But it's it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the. And and saw and sort of gluing them together and praying so again. 

Speaker 2 

For anyone else. That sounds absolutely fantastic and yeah. 

Speaker 3 

We'll see, but I think it's I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, we sort of come full circle in a way. This is what we were hoping that we would try. We'd start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because. 

Speaker 3 

Think it's worth trying. 

Speaker 2 

This won't work. Because this won't be and now. Possibly, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I mean another nice I I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree. Is that what I'm proposing here is we'll get oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see is there consistency, is there not is there. You have all these different methods to throw at this problem and. Personally, I think that's a I think it's informative either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates, that's reassuring in a certain sense. And if they don't, that's informative. That's telling you something about it about this. So I think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without detractors. But I'm. I'm. I'm a I think I think that's. On balance, I think that's good news. So that's my report, which isn't. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really, really exciting. So that that's fantastic. If we think that that we might be able to circle back to real estate, Newsome using some of the and then to sell great. Yeah, that's great. 

Speaker 3 

That's that's the idea. That's the idea. I mean. Yeah, let's say I'll try it out the I'll try it out. I'll. Try it out, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And I suppose our. Our ground, our foundation, is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so. Even if this yeah, more advanced work. Doesn't reveal what we want it to. We've got a when we're talking about originally about the what we really wanted was some sort of estimate of this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Again with with the caveat which. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it's an important caveat that the thing we're estimating is a proportion or not a count. But yeah, with that, with that caveat, we're we're solid. We're very, very solid. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Now I I was reading a paper which which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up. And and yeah, that's. That's great. I mean this, I'm. Gonna ask a really stupid question now. But if we have a proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size, can we not produce a scale up? 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. So that's right. Exactly. So we absolutely can we like if we if we want a number we can produce a number, there's two. Here's a pro. Here's a con. The Pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of. Cuz 1 sample. I mean again, there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better. So if there's other sources of data that we can incorporate, that's great. That's the pro the con is. Reflecting uncertainty in that world. I'll have to think about because. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Unless we had, like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then. Then there's uncertainty in that estimate, and I it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty. It's gotta be possible. I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee. But yeah, exactly. If if we if we want a number. 

Speaker 2 

No. OK. 

Speaker 3 

We can get a number. 

Speaker 2 

We just be. Yeah, it wouldn't be that. 

Speaker 3 

Confidence is something. Yeah. It would be tough to it. It would just be and we could just report that. I mean, we could just say, look, here's here's the estimate. There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty. And we can't for the other. 

Speaker 2 

It could be that confidence in that number. 

Speaker 3 

And here's it would just be upfront about it and say or even more straightforward. Here's our point estimate. And because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry. So take it or leave it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. But the and you tell me, Caroline, from, like, a policy perspective or impact perspective is I would say that a. Proportion would be. I mean, I know like at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from the Home Office is that. At the government level, they they do want numbers they want. Counts but it. I would say that a proportion would be of use question mark or. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so, yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at the. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Moment at the. Moment, we've just got descriptive statistics, so to have a proportion is a real step forward. 

Speaker 1 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. I can. I will. Yeah, I will get another couple. I will do that this afternoon actually. 

Speaker 2 

That would be fantastic. That. No, that's really, really good. Do you need anything? More from us, Scott at this stage. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Can you write my lecture slides for next week, please? That's the number one thing I need. Seriously with this. No. Well, just when you get to category 13 saying fixed up, which is I'm not worried about it. It's trivial. Just send it around again and I'll. 

Speaker 1 

I will. I will do it after the meeting. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. That's great. And and. Take long. No, it shouldn't. And I will. Yeah, yeah, I'll do the. I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon, at least I'll try to and see what comes out, and then I'm afraid we have to park it again because teaching is gonna be. 

Speaker 

No, but I. 

Speaker 2 

Think we've really made some good progress here and I've got. I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft. Stop the I've been making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using, so I want to consolidate that into the draft and I can share that with you. So that will be in a couple of weeks time and but I've got some time, but. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. That's a great idea. Oh, no, no, no, that's no rush. No rush. On my end please. 

Speaker 2 

Time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. We're in a position where we can start to do that. 

Speaker 3 

I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think. I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really, if I. I mean I I don't know this literature as well as they all do, but but it seems like. There's a possibility to make a real contribution, I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, very. Yeah, that is good. Yeah. Yeah, really good. 

Speaker 3 

Very cool. 

Speaker 2 

Right. Well, given that you've got exercises, I'm not proposing to detain. Yeah, you don't get any longer than we have to and slim with everything. Else from your side that we needed to cover. 

Speaker 1 

Today, I mean, there's just the categories that I've not done, I have to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that. My deliberate mistake. 

Speaker 1 

I I can also pay more attention to it. So I I will. Clean up the categories 13 and then recalculate the sum category and then share it with. Dispose of you and yeah. Is there anything else that I can help with? Doctor Moser? 

Speaker 3 

Let me I'm just looking at the. Right now, as long as I've got the node one and the node 2, that's important. Now it looks like the what's weather exploitation. You've mentioned a new e-mail type of. 

Speaker 1 

Whether they have been, but whether they have because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some fame, right? Right. OK. Thank you. Thank you. So. 

Speaker 1 

By looking at that. It's that. They are all exploited some degree. 

Speaker 3 

Got you. Right, which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got. The Yep. Nope. Bye. Ohh well there is one of them. I think we've already covered it. And that is what are the. It it if I'm gonna do that? Yeah, there is one. Very important thing. Thank you for. Thank you for that, Caroline. It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think book is set would be great, but which? If I wanted to dichotomize and say yes, you're in experiencing modern slavery. No, you're not. What questions? Plural, would I? What question should I use and and if there's more than one question, that's fine. Which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM. Seems like a pretty gold standard. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's good. So they got and the forced labour ones as well are more indicative of forced of once slavery. It's that last the point. 11 which is it potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labour? Not necessarily modern slavery, so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator, they they could be exploited. It's labour exploitation, but it isn't. It isn't modern slavery. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's Q 36 five B1? And so I should use that one. And the NRM. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the only one is definitely well, as definitely as. You can be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Within our data, modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, good point. And the 2 * 2. Anything else? Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable? 

Speaker 2 

Not that I can think of. Still him. Have you got any anything you want to? Mention anything common? Use. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I I'm looking at the. Document I I don't think so. 

Speaker 3 

OK, great. Good. Makes my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. OK. Thanks. Thanks as always everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, brilliant. Do you want to meet next week or give it? When do you want to? Catch up again. 

Speaker 3 

Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so. Sorry, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Are you around next Friday today? 

Speaker 1 

I for the next two weeks until the 22nd I might be not. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Because my annual review is coming up. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'm. I'm in the process of. Putting everything together. 

Speaker 2 

Right, OK, now that's fine. So it would be as well to have well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again. Probably at the beginning of December, when is your annual review. 

Speaker 

I can't. 

Speaker 1 

On the 28. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

The 28th, so the beginning. Of December would be aware. 

Speaker 1 

29 or 29th of November. Any day off on that one? 

Speaker 2 

Right. OK. 

Speaker 1 

3rd of December, since it's a Friday, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Is that a Friday again? Let me find my calendar too. 

Speaker 3 

Sorry about that. Fire alarm business. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh OK, so we're suggesting Scott. Perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the 1st of December. 

Speaker 3 

That works just if you don't mind sending me a team invite. That would be that would be great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, and and 12:00, is that still a good time? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I'm flexible, so whatever. If another time works better for you. All that's that's fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

That's alright for me. What about you, silly? 

Speaker 1 

11 or 12 is fine. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's go for 11, then I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft. So we've got some probably in the week before whatever stage it's in. I'll circulate it and and then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well. 

Speaker 1 

No. Ohh good. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

Sounds great. Thanks everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, good. Good to speak to. You thank you getting fire alarm sorted out, OK. 

Speaker 3 

All have a nice weekend. Yeah, me too. Talk to you later and you. Thank you. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Have a good weekend.

Transcript 

Speaker 2 

Hi, can you hear me? 

Speaker 1 

Yes, we can hear you, yes. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. Sorry I'm late. I slipped my mind. I was at the coffee shop and then popped up. Anyway, sorry I'm late. Sorry, nice to see you all. How are you? Staying warm, I hope. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, great. How are you doing? Cause you were, I think you had a doctor's appointment last week. Are you OK? 

Speaker 2 

Health better. Thank you. Yeah, I'm cold, but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it. But yeah, I've been marking hell. So how are you all? 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thank you. Yes. Been doing a little bit of teaching, but just a couple of skills days for social policy. Social workers. So yeah, most of my teaching takes place next term, so I've got. I'll be buried next in semester 2. 

Speaker 3 

I'm good. 

Speaker 2 

Well, so yeah. I I'm I'm. I'm I'm I'm I'm the opposite. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but yes, enjoy. Enjoy while you can. I haven't touched anything since we last talked, but that said it's still probably a good idea to touch base and see. What's next or what's where? Where we are just so we don't sort of get off track. Thanks a ton for the draft, I. I found the the sources and I gave it a quick read, but I haven't really done anything. I'm sorry, I've just been buried with teaching and grading so sorry. 

Speaker 1 

No, that's OK. I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it. So it is. It is a first draft, it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and Selim might be able to contribute like sections of text. So hopefully I'm not asking you to put in anything that. You're not not able and willing to contribute. 

Speaker 2 

No. Yes, of course. Thank you. I missed that though. Can you? What? What? I don't have it open. What? So I mean, obviously the the result, the methods and the results. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Yeah. So I've got some methodology down there, but there's obviously you you're closer to the detail of what you're doing. So yeah, methodology and results, that's it. And then once we've got that in and we can revisit the discuss. 

Speaker 2 

That's great. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And I've put some points down, but there will obviously be more coming out when we've got a A for the paper to work with. The other thing I'm aware that is outstanding is you'd asked us if they're given the quite high proportion that we're coming out with, whether we could just look at some simple statistics to see whether. That proportion seemed sensible and wondering Selim, have you seen that e-mail? Is that something you might be able to do? 

Speaker 3 

For us, you mean the article? 

Speaker 1 

No, the Scott's last e-mail about taking, just doing a sense check against the proportion figure that he's finding. 

Speaker 3 

No, I didn't. I I told you just now. But also for you doctor model. So I had in the last 2-3 weeks my annual review, the preparation and also the exam. That's why I didn't time with anything else. But it went well. So I passed a new review and yeah, so just update me quickly. Caroline, please. 

Speaker 1 

So I'll forward you the e-mail from Scott cause I've got it and then if you can just take it. It's not a big job, I don't think. But if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your findings. I mean Scott's very kindly indicated which questions it relates to. So it's it's literally a, a percentage, I think isn't it's got. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, the issue is just that the so we've got these like fancy schmancy techniques which are great and very preliminarily, I, I and this was weeks ago, I I I. Sup. Since then and I only had One Cup of coffee today, so this is all danger. But the the sort of where I parked it mentally is we have some initial estimates using these. These sort of next generation snowball samples, for lack of a better phrase, and that is not a very good phrase. And doing that gave some really high at least it seemed to me, really high in numbers and so. I was just thinking aloud to to to Caroline, and I'd welcome any and all inputs. Is is. Just as like, what if we don't do fancy smancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the the proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern slavery? Like what is that number? I don't know that number. And whatever that number is, it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have random sample etc etc etc. But just as a something to compare to. The I don't remember the exact numbers. Caroline do. Do you remember? It was. It was in the thousands, though, wasn't it in? 

Speaker 1 

The well, it was a proportion that you gave us, wasn't it was sort of 30% or something. 

Speaker 2 

Is it proportionate? That's right. That's right. Yeah, which just sounds. Really high. I mean, again, is the proportion of. Of my of domestic workers who I I think, yeah, plausibly we can say even a subset of those that are that are from the Philippines or from Latin America I think because that. We're not explicitly sampling that population, but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population. I think so. And so that the percentage just seemed to sound high to me, but I don't know anything about this, so. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Well, it's possible because they have no protection. And yeah, and and that's what I I think it is possible I think it, but I think it and I think it would attract interest. So it would be good to be as sure as we can about what we're saying because this seems to be quite a an interest. There's a lot of interest in this topic when. Jim and I published the preliminary report just looking at the descriptive. Sticks. We got a lot of media attention for that. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's great. 

Speaker 1 

So that was not really as exciting as what we're doing here. So I'm sure there would be continued interest from, I mean there's Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today, he's sort of following our work at the Rights lab. He always keeps an idea, an eye on what press releases we create. So he would. I'm sure pick it up again. That's great. Yeah, it is. I mean, from a an impact point of view, it's. It's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd include ours in that, but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has produced a report, but it's just descriptive statistics like us. So this really does move the conversation forward and I think. 

Speaker 2 

But that's great if there's if the. I'm sorry, you're. 

Speaker 1 

Good, now it says like with the change of government, if we presumably we get the change of government, then there there's a task force which is charged with looking at this issue within the first hundred days. So it's potentially got policy impact. So I think some Andrea Rain is leading something. This that a colleague at Nottingham Trent mentioned to me, so this is the sort of thing that her team would be interested in picking up as well. So it could be really timely. 

Speaker 2 

This is bent. This I really want to be done with grading and get back to this. This is really exciting. And that's what I was gonna say is the the. I wasn't aware of these. We're advocacy groups. I wasn't aware of sort of the specificity that like you mentioned, there's like a what was a Latin American women's. You know, that's great if if we can can and obviously you are connected to that, but that's that would be like you said. 

Speaker 1 

When it's right started, yes. 

Speaker 2 

That would be. Yeah, I mean, the more now we're. Having conversation and the. Once we start sort of subsetting it down the the the the proportion, the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this conversation, so that's very exciting. If OK, there's a big caveat. The big caveat there is. So thank you, Caroline again for the opportunity and I completely agree with you that like if we can do some quantity stuff with this, yeah, that would be, you know like way better than I did. But like that's that's a contribution. It makes you a little bit anxious because it makes me think like, OK, well, we really got to get these numbers right then because like this isn't, you know, this isn't something that. There's sort of other. It's like there's a a pool of of this kind of quantity prevalence estimation that we can sort of, you know, well we're close or we're not so close. So we differ. But here's why like it's. Pretty new, so just. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I agree. And when Bernard Silverman produced the stats, the initial stats for modern slavery in the UK, he used multiple systems estimation to do that. And he produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by policymakers. Which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end, in that the the the situation was far worse than his estimation suggested. So I think you're just talking, you're part of the conversation, but the conversation keeps evolving. Yeah. And the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that are not. Correct, but that are. A way of engaging people in the debate. So I think as long as we're clear about what we've done, how we've got to that, I think we're OK. 

Speaker 

That's a really. 

Speaker 2 

I think that's thank you for that, Karen. That's a really great perspective and and not one that I. Had so. So just to paraphrase, you're saying like. Well, I mean. I mean essentially like that's how science works is you, you make some mess and you do some research and then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed or whatever. And I I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly kind of like, well, I gotta make sure this number is, you know, right or this method is really justified. And I think you're right. That's. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Sort of not. That's a luxury we don't have in this particular research domain, and that's just that's that's that, right? That's that's that's not. It's not a sin against us. That's a nice perspective. I like that. That's thank you for that, Caroline. That's a good one. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. I mean, I think it's just listening to Bernard talked about his experience and yeah, I mean, I think he said that the number of slaves were between 11 and 13,000 and then later estimates suggested up to 148,000. So I mean, that was quite a significant change in the number, but. 

Speaker 2 

Right. I just, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

His his paper started that conversation and yeah. So I think it's just viewing it as this is a contribution to the debate based on these particular methods. 

Speaker 2 

Right, right. Sounds good. OK, so when I get time when? When I'm out of marking hell. What's the what's the? What's the next step or help reorient me, please. As to what? What, what? 

Speaker 1 

Revealed that. Yeah. So I think it's trying to flesh out that draft, so I'll I can go back to it and Polish up what I've written and make sure that it cause it's not a bit less stream of consciousness and but actually it needs input from you and Celine as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's. 

Speaker 2 

I can do. 

Speaker 1 

The the skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit. Once you've had a chance to have a look at, it's got perhaps where you think. We might target it and whether it needs. The the sort of context setting to to appeal to the audience. That's the journal that we think we. 

Speaker 

Good point. 

Speaker 1 

Want to go for? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Good. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Thank you. That's helpful. 

Speaker 1 

And I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in. My mind that a. Lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in Word and I think you you do understand latex, don't you? So it might be better actually to write it in latex, which I've never used. But perhaps if we can get the draft up to a certain standard, you would be able to then transfer it for us. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, absolutely. No, it's fine, actually. And there's there's. So back in the day, you're right that in. Fact one of my early collab. Craters. So I use latex and he didn't and we had this project and he early on he was. He was like we're never gonna publish this because we just we're just gonna clash. And so anyway I'm trying to say back in the day there was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions. It's really pretty straightforward to convert. So we can. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, are they OK, good. So we could still. 

Speaker 2 

We can still, we can still we still talk to each other should be. Should be OK. 

Speaker 1 

That's right. That's right. 

Speaker 2 

But yeah, that's a good point. Salem, do you mind taking a step? I don't know. What? What let review in terms of like the methods, needs, needs or is desired, but do you feel comfortable taking a stab at that so you know the? Basically, I think I've sent along at this point troll the troll, the trove of emails I've sent. I think there's A and Caroline as well. A number of papers that that address the kinds of methods that we're using, question mark. 

Speaker 3 

So I I have written down for now. And the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the methods section in the article that Caroline sent and the second task is the forwarded e-mail. So it seems there are some task I I just had a glance into it. Look into the e-mail that Caroline just now forwarded and then asked that. For you, Doctor Mose, you're asking for some information from my end, so I will look into that. And what else is there? 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, the method section of the paper I've already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies. Yeah, so? OK, so there there is a method section there. And and then. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but it's gonna be very sharp, right? 

Speaker 1 

It's OK. I mean, the whole paper is 4000 words. Currently, I don't know quite what we're we're targeting, what length we're targeting, but I've asked you specifically if you could add the network structure graphic. You remember that we put that that actually visualizes the structure of the network. And and the way the extent to which it's constructed. Of different waves. So that was that section. That, yeah, if you could put that section in. And then I've asked, Scott, if he could include the point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated. And then. The bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft. Because you know what you've done? Not so. That's those those areas are indicated in the paper. I'll just put them in. They're indicated at the moment in just normal text. I've just put them in bold. So you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier. 

Speaker 

Thank you. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

And then obviously I'll I can Polish up the text, but I I don't want to spend too much time. Doing that until. Yeah, until we know. What the over whether it sort of hangs together as an overall narrative, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you very much, Carolina. See it. It's it's. I see what has to be done and I don't have time to do it today. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, that's the big the big problem. 

Speaker 3 

Isn't it? I could do my part. Or what the? Weekend and also in in in the beginning of next week. So I'm I'm more free. 

Speaker 2 

Now, great. Excellent. 

Speaker 1 

Is your. Did your timetable get a bit better in the new year then Scott? Is that going to be, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it it gets. It gets better until about I have one of these intensive things and and I plan to work. So things will get a lot better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Fiercely then. But. Yeah, for about. Not quite a week, but essentially next week I'm. I'm yeah. Anyway, it's. I mean, I see what has to be done. I can't wait to do it. And and I'm so sorry, but I simply can't right now, right. 

Speaker 1 

No, no, that's, I mean, I completely understand the teaching is something you can't ignore. 

Speaker 2 

And and and marking is just so many and the oh so many, so many, so many. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I feel your pain. 

Speaker 2 

Will you be? I'll sadly, or I don't know. For better. So I'll. I'll probably work over parts of the break probably until late December and e-mail and what I'm trying to say is. I'll. I'll work on this likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope you're with your families. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'll try not to, I must admit. But my January is not too bad. So if if we can. 

Speaker 2 

In June. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

And reconvene, perhaps in January. Does that suit you too, Celine? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I could do online because or even in person I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week, but we could also meet online. So there's. No problem. Yeah. Online or doesn't matter. 

Speaker 1 

So would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've got something to in the diary to work to? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, let's do so. Ideally before the 15th of January maybe. 

Speaker 1 

What? What? 

Speaker 2 

And then agreed. 

Speaker 1 

Do you want to pick a is Friday still going to be? Good for you, Scott. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, until teaching start, I think I don't even know my timetable for next next term, but the yeah, Fridays should be should be fine. So I I do something before the before the 15th, but after the 4th would be good for me. I think I'll. I think I'll be traveling until the 4th. So I don't know maybe. 

Speaker 3 

Add the 12th Friday the 12th June. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, the 12, what's that like? Yeah. And does this time work? 

Speaker 2 

Looks great for me. 

Speaker 1 

This, this, this a meeting at this time work. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, it works for me. 11:00 AM again. 

Speaker 2 

Great, good. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, let's put that in and then we'll see where we are. I'll just do. 

Speaker 2 

That's it. That's great. That's that's that's a great deadline and that the plan gives me enough time to. That's great. That's a great deadline for me. Thank you. That's. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

And still in if you just add your section into the current document and that's in the shared file, then we've got 1 shared copy that we're all working on. That would be great. 

Speaker 3 

We have done that before, so should. 

Speaker 

Be fine. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. We sort of know what we're doing with. That so? 

Speaker 

That's great. 

Speaker 2 

Oh yeah, since it's on the share or the OneDrive. Is that right? OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, it is. It's it's not in the folder that you set up those spots cause I don't seem to have access to put things in there, but it is it's. On the OneDrive. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. Thanks. 

Speaker 1 

The links in the e-mail I can resend it if you think that would be useful. 

Speaker 2 

Couldn't hurt you. Couldn't hurt. I'm sure. I'm sure I have it. But if you don't mind, that would be great. Yeah. Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

Alright, let me see if I can hunt it out. 

Speaker 2 

Or don't worry about. It I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we'll just see if I can find it. Here we are. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Right. I just resent the the e-mail, so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your inbox now. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Thanks a ton. Thanks a ton. Oh, good. That's great. So like I said, I like this deadline. And now I must return to marking, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Smoking. Yes, and he might need more coffee. 

Speaker 2 

I absolutely do. So please, please, please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because vicariously is the only way. I will get to enjoy it so. 

Speaker 3 

So, doctor, more than I have been told by another academic staff when I told, they told me during these two weeks of marking treaties. Now eat the candies, eat fast food, or just to treat yourself from the marking, marking stress. 

Speaker 2 

That's great. I I will thank you. That's great. I'll, I'll. I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well. That's. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Should do some fantastic. 

Speaker 1 

Guys, OK. Won't hold you anymore. Then stop. Good catch up. I'm glad you're feeling better. 

Speaker 2 

Really great to see you all and and and and. Yeah, I look forward to. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Let's see if we can get something in the. New year. Good. See you. 

Speaker 3 

And then. I see your. 

Speaker 2 

Bye. Happy holidays, everyone. Take care. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Thank you. Bye. Bye then. 

 

## Voice040_sd20240223_DWinUK.txt
Yeah, all good. Thank you. Good. Just discussing the some question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns. Yeah.
It just never ends. It's just, it's just, yeah. Anyway.
We feel your pain from the previous term.
Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to college. It seems that you're in the majority of Carolina that at least among people I talked to that this term is the heavy term compared to last term.
So I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. And I'm very glad mine is over so or yeah, you know.
Yeah, so I saw your email Scott say thank you for prompting us. I think we still even I would just discussing the like a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting.
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah.
That won't really help us.
But so there are two issues that the clean data that you need to be able to do anything.
And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything.
Are those the two main issues for you?
Yes, that's exactly right. And for whatever it's worth. I feel like we're really close.
But yeah, that's that's exactly right, Caroline.
So Dr. Moses, you have sent me last time and you taught me to do that bootstrapping.
And so I also told us to Caroline. Yeah.
When we're waiting. I didn't do anything. That's okay.
When I saw your Tuesday, I said to you, I will send you something. Yeah, but I couldn't get. Yeah.
Yeah, I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person like me and you so that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together.
Yeah, I will be on Monday on campus. Would you have time then to Monday?
Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon three or four.
Can you do before 1pm or before noon?
No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1pm. I think hang on.
I can't do it 1pm until 2pm and then from 3pm until 4pm and then from 5pm until 6pm.
So I could do from 1pm until no from I could do from 2pm until 3pm.
2pm should work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that should work.
On Monday. Yeah.
Do you mind sending me a team's invite? We can meet where we can meet my office, your office, coffee.
We can meet in your office. That's fine. That's fine.
But the main thing, the most urgent thing I think is this data issues is the, I just don't understand what's, did my question make sense or am I just confused?
Which question? Yeah, exactly. Right. My question about the, about the data and the code books.
You asked something about the code book and I think the code book that I had sent in end of November, beginning of end of November, this is also the latest one.
Okay, good.
This should be the most recent updated code book that we have. Good.
And then you had also a question about the referrals to phone numbers, 10 or 5.
Yeah, it's, well, yeah, yeah, because the data, yeah, exactly.
Yeah, so for that is, in our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or 10, but we said we will only accept up to five.
Yeah, just the first thing. Okay.
Second information is, even if people have referred, let's say, seven people, five, it does mean they have been successful.
No, of course, right, of course. So that's why, in order to understand how many referrals we had eventually, we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID, and at the wave, so that we can identify which I, which person ID recruiter has successfully recruited or referred people.
I got that. And of course, really, the successful recruit referrals aren't the same as referrals, and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The issue is really just one of variables.
It looks like some people refer up to nine people, and that's, or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine.
Up to 10, yeah. But then there are these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be three phone numbers, and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number.
So on the survey, people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone, and some other people could only refer three or four people.
That doesn't explain the gap.
Let me share my screen if you don't mind, and probably easier to just look at it.
I have to figure out how to share my name screen. Let's try that. Hopefully that's working. Can you see my Excel?
Yeah.
These are great examples.
Okay, so first let me pop over to the code book, and there's no coding after Q90.
My understanding is that Q105 here, up to Q110, were the referrals that were used. So those were the coupons that were given.
And then you've got this person who refers nine people. That's fine. That makes sense. But look at this person.
This person refers three phone numbers, and then they refer six nothings, and then there's a phone number way over here.
Or take this person. Their Q105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I just don't understand how this happens.
Yeah.
So for starters, is my understanding correct that this is the possible set of phone numbers?
Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five, that we don't actually give the coupons, and that's great.
And that's actually super helpful.
But the reason I'm asking is because at our last meeting, we had this observation. I think Caroline had a great suggestion.
But there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people.
And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should fix that up. And that's right.
And then I was thinking, well, hang on. That logic applies to everybody.
So if you say you know two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give five phone numbers, that same logic applies.
And we should still fix up that number.
And so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give.
And I, like, so for this row, what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is it four?
Or can we not tell?
In that case that you have highlighted before.
Okay, good. Thank you.
Okay, that's excellent. That's what I understand. And so and likewise, so this for this row, the number would be nine.
Yeah, nine.
Okay, so basically I shouldn't worry about the or the gaps or the ordering.
I think you shouldn't worry about gaps in between the phone number referrals.
And if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the printed survey from the just system.
So you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer.
People were filled out.
Wonderful. Yes. Thank you. That's that's super wonderful.
But now even even this conversation is super helpful because now I know the the number of phone numbers that a person gave.
And that was the missing piece that I was I was.
Yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess, but but so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can.
Oh, I'm going to take this off.
And and that's great news. Thank you. I will.
How do I stop? I will.
I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff.
And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're we're we're we're virtually ready to go. Oh, oh, the population estimate. Yes, Caroline, what were your thoughts on on that?
So I've been tracking the Europeans on this and they have a category that they call personal household services PHS.
And they've started to collect data on this.
And it comprises two elements.
So there's the just jotted down the details that I found.
And they work without accommodation, which has a NAC code 88. And then they have an activities of households as employees of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97.
Now that is also a sick code for the UK, this activities. So that's very closely linked to domestic workers that second one is tightly bounded.
An analysis that included UK figures from 2017. So it's not too far away.
And it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. Yeah. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000 respectively.
The social work without accommodation is that bigger figure. And then the activities of households as employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure.
Excellent. So the paper, they've got some trends for other countries and they, I mean, I think we could make an argument that they're broadly static.
Okay, if you're saying we're not very sensitive.
Yeah.
So the question then is, for us, do we want to combine them to have this that gives you the one million figure that I think, or roughly a million, or do we want to take this smaller lower number of 51,000 that's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure
number is larger than that. It's 79,000.
So.
So hang on. I think I misread you. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000.
929,000.
Oh, wow. Okay. My mistake.
And what were the codes again? I'm sorry. NEC? I don't know this.
N-A-C-E. I don't know what it stands for. But N-A-C-E-88.
Okay.
Which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an email. So,
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.
That's all right. And N-A-C-E-97, which is this activities of households as employers of domestic personnel.
So I think that probably can now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through Eurostat and try and pull out something more recent. But if, yeah, that's what I was hoping.
I agree.
Yeah.
But that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range.
Yeah.
From we've got lower and upper limits, haven't we?
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
But perhaps is the most.
Yep. I think that's a great idea.
Conservative approach.
Yes. I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the, the, I don't know what I'm sorry. I don't know where the 1.7 million came from.
The, it's really, it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all.
I haven't played with things as small as 50, 51,000. But I will. And I think you're right. I think the range, I think we say, you know, here's the number that we're using site, site, site.
In the appendix, here's the robot, here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change. And I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said, it was like from 900 to a million to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher, like nothing changes.
So, so I, and I don't know about the lower. So I'll, but I'll play with this. So I think this is, please don't spend any more time on, I mean, please do save the citation.
We can, we can, you know, site the site the site.
I've got, yeah, I've logged it across in an email to you.
Really? What I've just told you now. So we've got, we've got the link to the numbers.
Good. Okay. Well, I can, I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon.
Should we meet next week or if, if Selene can get the, well, that's not entirely off.
I can have, I can have everything except the in some polished by next Friday and depending on how our meeting goes on Monday, Selene. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer. I don't know.
But, but, but, but the, just from the, just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure.
Okay. Would a three o'clock meeting next week be all right?
Sure.
I've got something in for two.
No problem.
Already.
Yeah.
Does that work for you, Selene?
Yeah, as long as it's after afternoon is fine.
Yeah. So we said three.
Yeah, it's fine for me.
I'll send something across.
I also sent a meeting link.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so how, how do you, how should I prepare for this meeting? What are you?
Yeah.
I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions. Yeah.
And some small questions.
So that's fine.
You can guide me.
Sure.
So you don't need to prepare anything.
Just about that.
Okay. Okay.
He said, he said, okay.
All right.
All right.
Sounds good.
And thanks for, like I said, this was.
This is very helpful for me.
So thanks.
That's great.
Yeah.
No, it's just, it just is tantalizing now, isn't it?
Cause it was, I think we, we get it.
As you say, we're getting close.
So close.
It's really just, just delivering now.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean it critically, Selene.
Not at all.
And in fact, I was, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, I'm not saying anything critical.
It's just, I, I, I'm with Caroline.
Like we just, let's get it done.
Let's get it done.
We can, we can, we can do it.
So thanks.
Thanks so much.
And I hope you have.
Find some time to enjoy the weekend.
And we'll talk in a week.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Good to see you.
Thanks very much.
Bye everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn but I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.
My master's gone away.
That's the lyric.
Okay.
Here we go again.
Same French guy.
All right, sir.

Speaker 3 

Yeah, all good. Thank you. Just this lovely and the question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns. 

Speaker 2 

Good. How are you? Good. Yeah, it just never ends. It just it's just. Yeah, yeah. Anyway. 

Speaker 3 

We we feel your pain from the previous term anyway. 

Speaker 2 

Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to call it, it seems that you're in the majority of Caroline. That at least among people I talked to the the this term is the heavier term compared to last term. So I'm sorry, I'm very sorry and I'm very glad mine is over. So or. Yeah, you know. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So I I saw your e-mail, Scott said. Thank you for prompting us. I think we, Celine and I were just discussing that like a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting and I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah, that won't really help us. 

Speaker 2 

Great. 

Speaker 3 

But so there are two issues. There's there's the the clean data that you need. To be able to do anything. And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything. Are those the two main issues for you? 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, that's exactly right. And and for whatever it's worth, I feel like we're really close the but, but but yeah, that's that. That's exactly right. Caroline the the. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So, Doctor Moser, you have sent me last time and you. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And taught me to do that bootstrapping, and so I also. Told to Caroline. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

While we're waiting, I didn't do anything when I saw you on Tuesday, I said to you, I I will send you something Thursday, but I couldn't get. I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person, like me and you. 

Speaker 2 

That's OK. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together, so I will be on Monday. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

On campus, would you have timed them to me? 

Speaker 2 

Monday. Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon. Three or four. 

Speaker 1 

Can you do before 1:00 PM or before noon? 

Speaker 2 

No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1:00 PM, I think. Hang on. No. OK, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

One 1:00 PM. I can't do it. 1:00 PM until 2:00. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then from three until 4:00, and then from 5:00 until 6:00. So I could do from 1:00 until no. From I could do from 2:00 PM until 3:00 PM. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Uh, 2:00 PM should work, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that should work. 

Speaker 1 

This Monday on like on Monday 2:00 PM. Yeah, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Do you mind sending me a a. A teams invite? We can meet where we can meet my office. Your office? Or coffee or. 

Speaker 1 

Let's meet in your office. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine. That's fine. It's the, but the the main thing, the most urgent thing, I think, is this. Data issue is the is the. I just don't understand what's. Did my question make sense or am I just confused? 

Speaker 1 

Which question? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly right. My question about the about the data and the code books. 

Speaker 1 

So you you have, you have asked some of the code and I say the code book that I had sent in end of November beginning of end of November, this is also the latest one. So this should be the most recent updated code book that we have. And then you had also a question about. 

Speaker 2 

Uh-huh. OK, good. Good. 

Speaker 1 

The the the referrals. The phone numbers? Yeah, 4:50. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it's well, yeah, because the data. Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So for that is. In our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or 10. But we said we will only accept up to five. Yeah, just the first thing. The second information is. 

Speaker 2 

Uh-huh. OK. 

Speaker 1 

Even if people have referred, let's say, seven people or five, it doesn't mean they have been successful with Pharrell. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. That's right. No, of course. Right, of course. 

Speaker 1 

So that's why in order to. And. How many referrals we had? Eventually we we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID and at the wave so that we can identify which I which person or ideal recruiter has successfully recruited. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. 

Speaker 1 

Will refer to people. 

Speaker 2 

You know, I I got that. And you're, of course you're right that that the the successful recruiting referrals aren't the same as referrals is and and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The the the issue is is is really just one of the variables it looks like. Some people refer up to 99 people, and that's or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine up to 10. Yeah, but then. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

There's these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be 3 phone numbers and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number. So like. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So. Some underserved you people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone. And some other people could only refer three or four people, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. That's right. No, but but the. 

Speaker 3 

That doesn't explain the gap talking about. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Let let me share share my screen if you don't mind, and it's probably easier to to just look at it. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, please. 

Speaker 2 

If I have to figure. Out how to share my? Screen. Let's try that. Hopefully that's working. Can you? The. Like so, so, so so, like here. This is. These are like, great examples. So I'm OK. So first, let me pop over to the code book and there, there, there is. There's no coding after Q90. My understanding is that Q 105 here. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Up to Q110 were the referrals that were used, so those were the cube coupons that were given. But then you've got this person who refers, you know, nine people. That's fine, that makes sense. But look at this person. This person refers 3 phone numbers and then. They refer 6 nothings and then they refer and then there's a phone number way over here or take this person. Their Q 105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I I just don't understand how this happens. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So for starters. Is my understanding correct that that this? Is the possible set of phone numbers. Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five that we don't have to give the coupons, and that's great. And that's actually super helpful. But the the reason I'm asking is because our last our last meeting we had this. We we had this observation, I think Caroline had a great suggestion. I don't remember, but there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people. And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should we should, we should fix that up. And that's right. And then I was thinking, well, hang on, that logic applies to everybody. So if you say, you know, two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give 5 phone numbers. That same logic applies, and we should still fix up that that, that number, and so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give. And and I and I like so for this row. What what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is? It. Four or can we not tell? 

Speaker 1 

In in that case that you have highlighted. It would before. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

444 people. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's excellent that I understand. And so and and likewise so this for this other number would be 9. Yeah. OK, so basically I shouldn't worry about the OR the gaps or the ordering? 

Speaker 1 

949. I think you shouldn't worry about the gaps in between the phone number referrals and if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the the printed survey from the jest system so you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer. So. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

That would be. 

Speaker 1 

The people were. 

Speaker 2 

That would be wonderful. Yes, thank you. That's that's super wonderful. But now even even this conversation is super helpful, because now I know the. 

Speaker 1 

Service. 

Speaker 2 

The number of phone numbers that a person gave, and that was the missing piece that I was. I was, yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess. But. But so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can. Oh, I'm going to take this off and and that's great news. Thank. You. I will, I will. How do I stop? I will. I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff. And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're we're we're we're virtually ready. Oh, the the population estimate. Yes. Caroline, what your thoughts on on that? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So I've been tracking the Europeans on this and they have a category that they call personal household services, PHS, and they've started to collect data on this. And it comprises 2 elements. So there's the I just jotted down the details that I found so they have social work without accommodation, which has an NAACP code 88, and then they have an activities of households as employers of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97 now. That is also a sick. Code for the UK this activity, so that's very closely linked to domestic workers. That second one is tightly bounded and then I found a. 

Speaker 

Hmm. 

Speaker 3 

An analysis that included UK figures from 2017, so it's not too far away and and it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Respectively. So the social work without accommodation is that bigger figure and then the activities of households and employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. 

Speaker 3 

So the the paper they they've got some trends for other countries and they I mean I think we can make an argument that. They're broadly static. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

You're saying we're not very sensitive, so the question then is. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

For us, do we want to combine them right to have this that gives you the 1,000,000 figure that I think or roughly a million or do we want to take this smaller lower number than 51,000? That's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure number is larger than that, it's 79,000. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

So. 

Speaker 2 

So I'm I think I'm surgery. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000. 

Speaker 3 

929,000. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, wow. OK my mistake and and what were the codes again? I'm sorry, NBC, I don't know this. 

Speaker 3 

N A/C EI don't know what it stands for, but N A/C E 88 which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an e-mail, so you've got this. 

Speaker 2 

OK. OK. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. OK, good. 

Speaker 3 

That's right. And N A/C E 97, which is this activities households as employers of domestic personnel. 

Speaker 2 

Which is that? Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

So think that probably could now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through your stat and try and pull out something more recent, but if? Yeah, I was like, yeah, I agree. Yeah. So but that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range. Yeah, from. We've got lower and upper limits, haven't we and? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

That, perhaps is the most. 

Speaker 2 

Yep, I think that's a great idea and. 

Speaker 3 

Conservative approach. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the uh, the, I don't know what. I'm sorry, I don't know where the 1.7 million came from, but the. It's really. It it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like, once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all. I haven't played with things as as small as 5051 thousand, but I, I well and I think you're right. I think the I think we say you know, here's the number that we're using. 

Speaker 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 2 

Site site site in the appendix. Here's the robot. Here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change, and I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said. Like from 900 to 1,000,000 to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher like nothing changes. So so I I don't know about the lower so but I'll play with this. So I think this is please don't spend any more. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Time on I. Mean please do save the citation so we can we can, you know, cite the. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes, I've got. Yeah, I've. I've logged it across in an e-mail to you. What? What I've just told you now. So we've got you. We've got the link. 

Speaker 2 

Say the same thing. 

Speaker 1 

Brilliant. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. OK. Well, I can. I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon. 

Speaker 3 

Some of the numbers. 

Speaker 2 

Should we meet next week or if, if Salim can get the well, that's that entire. I can have. I can have everything except the in sum. Polished by next Friday and depending on how our meeting goes on Monday. Celine. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer, I don't know, but but the just from the just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. Would a 3:00 meeting next week be alright? And got something in for two already? Yeah. Does that work for you? 

Speaker 2 

Sure. No problem. 

Speaker 3 

Celine. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, as long as it's after. Afternoon is fine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So we said three. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it's fine. It's fine for. 

Speaker 3 

Me. I'll send something across. 

Speaker 2 

Sounds great. 

Speaker 1 

I also sent meeting. Link Dr. Moser just now for 2:00 PM. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And so how do you how should I prepare for this meeting? What do you? Yeah, how should? 

Speaker 1 

I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions here and some small questions there so that you can guide me so you don't need to prepare this one then it will be just about that. 

Speaker 3 

Sure, that's fine. 

Speaker 2 

Sure, sure, sure. Well, OK, OK. You said you said OK, alright, alright. Sounds, sounds sounds good. And thanks. Like I said, this is. It's very helpful for me. So thanks. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. No, it's it's just it just it's tantalising now isn't it cause it was I think we're guessing as you say we're getting close. So it's really just just delivering. 

Speaker 2 

Close, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Now I think it was. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, no, no. I didn't mean it critically silly. I'm not at all. In fact, I was. No, no, no. I'm not saying anything critical. It's just I was just, let's get it done. Let's get it done. We can we can. We can do it. So thanks. Thanks so much. And I hope you have find some time to enjoy the weekend and we'll talk in. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Yeah, I don't sleep good to see you soon. 

Speaker 1 

Thanks guys. See. 

Speaker 2 

You. Sorry. See you. Thanks very much. Bye everybody. 

Speaker 4 

I don't care. Jimmy crack corn and I don't care corn and I don't care Jimmy crack corn, but I don't. Care. Ohh, Jimmy. Good morning. I don't care. My master's gone away. That's the lyric. OK, already Lordy, here we go. Again, we go again. 

Speaker 

Same French guy. Alright, Sir. Hey. Ohh, hold on. Problem alright. 6:00 AM. OK.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah, all good. Thank you. Just discussing the some question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns.

**ScottM:**  
Good. How are you? Good. Yeah, it just never ends. It's just, it's just, yeah. Anyway.

**CarolineE:**  
We feel your pain from the previous term anyway.

**ScottM:**  
Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to colleagues, it seems that you're in the majority of Carolina that at least among people I talked to, this term is the heavy term compared to last term. So I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. And I'm very glad mine is over, so or yeah, you know.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah. So I saw your email, Scott. Thank you for prompting us. I think Celine and I were just discussing a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah, that won't really help us.

**ScottM:**  
Great.

**CarolineE:**  
But so there are two issues. There's the clean data that you need to be able to do anything. And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything. Are those the two main issues for you?

**ScottM:**  
Yes, that's exactly right. And for whatever it's worth, I feel like we're really close. But yeah, that's exactly right, Caroline.

**SelimY:**  
So, Doctor Moser, you have sent me last time and you taught me to do that bootstrapping. And so I also told to Caroline.

**Speaker:**  
Yeah.

**SelimY:**  
While we're waiting, I didn't do anything. When I saw your Tuesday, I said to you, I will send you something. Yeah, but I couldn't get. I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person like me and you.

**ScottM:**  
That's okay.

**SelimY:**  
So that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together. I will be on Monday on campus. Would you have time then?

**ScottM:**  
Monday. Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon three or four.

**SelimY:**  
Can you do before 1 PM or before noon?

**ScottM:**  
No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1 PM. I think, hang on. I can't do it 1 PM until 2 PM and then from 3 PM until 4 PM and then from 5 PM until 6 PM. So I could do from 2 PM until 3 PM.

**ScottM:**  
2 PM should work, yeah.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, that should work. On Monday.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, do you mind sending me a team's invite? We can meet where we can meet, my office, your office, coffee.

**SelimY:**  
Let's meet in your office.

**ScottM:**  
That's fine. But the main thing, the most urgent thing, I think, is this data issue. I just don't understand what's, did my question make sense or am I just confused?

**SelimY:**  
Which question?

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, exactly right. My question about the data and the code books.

**SelimY:**  
You asked something about the code book and I think the code book that I had sent in end of November, this is also the latest one. This should be the most recent updated code book that we have. And then you had also a question about the referrals to phone numbers.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, it's, well, yeah, because the data, yeah, exactly.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, so for that is, in our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or ten, but we said we will only accept up to five. Yeah, just the first thing. The second information is, even if people have referred, let's say, seven people, five, it doesn't mean they have been successful.

**ScottM:**  
No, of course. Right, of course.

**SelimY:**  
So that's why, in order to understand how many referrals we had eventually, we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID, and at the wave, so that we can identify which person ID recruiter has successfully recruited or referred people.

**ScottM:**  
I got that. And of course, really, the successful recruit referrals aren't the same as referrals, and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The issue is really just one of variables. It looks like some people refer up to nine people, and that's, or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine.

**SelimY:**  
Up to ten, yeah.

**ScottM:**  
But then there are these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be three phone numbers, and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, so on the survey, people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone, and some other people could only refer three or four people.

**ScottM:**  
That doesn't explain the gap.

**CarolineE:**  
Let me share my screen if you don't mind, and probably easier to just look at it.

**SelimY:**  
Please.

**ScottM:**  
I have to figure out how to share my screen. Let's try that. Hopefully, that's working. Can you see my Excel?

**SelimY:**  
Yeah.

**ScottM:**  
These are great examples. Okay, so first let me pop over to the code book, and there's no coding after Q90. My understanding is that Q105 here, up to Q110, were the referrals that were used. So those were the coupons that were given. But then you've got this person who refers nine people. That's fine. That makes sense. But look at this person. This person refers three phone numbers, and then they refer six nothings, and then there's a phone number way over here. Or take this person. Their Q105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I just don't understand how this happens.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah.

Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five, that we don't actually give the coupons, and that's great. And that's actually super helpful.

And I, like, so for this row, what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is it four? Or can we not tell?

**SelimY:**  
In that case that you have highlighted before.

**ScottM:**  
Okay, good. Thank you.

**SelimY:**  
It would be four people.

**ScottM:**  
Okay, that's excellent. That's what I understand. And so and likewise so this for this other number would be nine. Yeah. Okay, so basically I shouldn't worry about the or the gaps or the ordering?

**SelimY:**  
I think you shouldn't worry about gaps in between the phone number referrals. And if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the printed survey from the just system. So you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer. People were filled out.

**ScottM:**  
That would be wonderful. Yes. Thank you. That's super wonderful. But now even this conversation is super helpful because now I know the number of phone numbers that a person gave. And that was the missing piece that I was I was. Yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess. But so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can. Oh, I'm going to take this off. And and that's great news. Thank you. I will. I will. How do I stop? I will. I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff. And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're virtually ready to go. Oh, the population estimate. Yes, Caroline, what were your thoughts on on that?

**CarolineE:**  
I've been tracking the Europeans on this, and they have a category that they call personal household services PHS. And they've started to collect data on this. And it comprises two elements. So there's the just jotted down the details that I found. And they have social work without accommodation, which has a NAC code 88. And then they have an activities of households as employees of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97. Now that is also a sick code for the UK, this activities. So that's very closely linked to domestic workers. That second one is tightly bounded.

 An analysis that included UK figures from 2017. So it's not too far away. And it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000 respectively. The social work without accommodation is that bigger figure. And then the activities of households as employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure.

**ScottM:**  
Excellent.

**CarolineE:**  
So the paper, they've got some trends for other countries, and they, I mean, I think we could make an argument that they're broadly static.

**ScottM:**  
Okay.

**CarolineE:**  
You're saying we're not very sensitive. So the question then is, for us, do we want to combine them to have this that gives you the one million figure that I think, or roughly a million, or do we want to take this smaller lower number of 51,000 that's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure number is larger than that. It's 79,000.

**ScottM:**  
Right.

**CarolineE:**  
So.

**ScottM:**  
So hang on. I think I misread you. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000.

**CarolineE:**  
929,000.

**ScottM:**  
Oh, wow. Okay. My mistake. And what were the codes again? I'm sorry. NAC? I don't know this.

**CarolineE:**  
N-A-C-E. I don't know what it stands for. But N-A-C-E-88.

**ScottM:**  
Okay.

**CarolineE:**  
Which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an email. So,

**ScottM:**  
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.

**CarolineE:**  
That's all right. And N-A-C-E-97, which is this activities of households as employers of domestic personnel.

**ScottM:**  
Which is that, yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
So I think that probably can now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through Eurostat and try and pull out something more recent. But if, yeah, that's what I was hoping.

**ScottM:**  
I agree.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
But that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
From we've got lower and upper limits, haven't we?

**ScottM:**  
Yeah, exactly.

**CarolineE:**  
But perhaps is the most.

**ScottM:**  
Yep, I think that's a great idea.

**CarolineE:**  
Conservative approach.

**ScottM:**  
Yes, I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the, I don't know what, I'm sorry. I don't know where the 1.7 million came from. The, it's really, it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all. I haven't played with things as small as 50, 51,000. But I will. And I think you're right. I think the range, I think we say, you know, here's the number that we're using, site, site, site. In the appendix, here's the robot, here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change. And I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said, it was like from 900 to a million to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher, like nothing changes. So, so I, and I don't know about the lower. So I'll, but I'll play with this. So I think this is, please don't spend any more time on, I mean, please do save the citation. We can, we can, you know, site the site the site.

**CarolineE:**  
Yes, I've logged it across in an email to you. Really, what I've just told you now. So we've got, we've got the link to the numbers.

**ScottM:**  
Good. Okay. Well, I can, I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon. Should we meet next week or if, if Selene can get the, well, that's not entirely off. I can have everything except the in some polished by next Friday. And depending on how our meeting goes on Monday, Selene. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer. I don't know. But, but with the input, just from the input, just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure.

**CarolineE:**  
That's great. Would a three o'clock meeting next week be all right?

**ScottM:**  
Sure.

**CarolineE:**  
I've got something in for two.

**ScottM:**  
No problem.

**CarolineE:**  
Already.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
Does that work for you, Selene?

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, as long as it's after afternoon is fine.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah, so we said three.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah, it's all right. It's fine for me.

**CarolineE:**  
I'll send something across.

**SelimY:**  
I also sent a meeting link.

**ScottM:**  
Thank you.

**SelimY:**  
Yeah.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah. And so how, how do you, how should I prepare for this meeting? What are you?

**SelimY:**  
I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions. Yeah. And some small questions. So that's fine. You can guide me. Sure. So you don't need to prepare anything. Just about that.

**CarolineE:**  
Sure, that's fine.

**ScottM:**  
Sure, sure, sure. Okay. All right. All right. Sounds, sounds sounds good. And thanks for, like I said, this was very helpful for me. So thanks. That's great.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah. No, it's just, it just is tantalizing now, isn't it? Cause it was, I think we, we get it, as you say, we're getting close. So close. It's really just, just delivering now.

**ScottM:**  
Yeah.

**CarolineE:**  
Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean it critically, Selene. Not at all. And in fact, I was, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything critical. It's just, I, I'm with Caroline, like we just, let's get it done. Let's get it done. We can, we can, we can do it. So thanks. Thanks so much. And I hope you have find some time to enjoy the weekend. And we'll talk in a week.

**CarolineE:**  
Yeah, good to see you.

**SelimY:**  
Thanks, guys.

**ScottM:**  
See you.

**SelimY:**  
Bye, everybody.

**Speaker 4:**  
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care. Jimmie crack corn and I don't care. Jimmie crack corn, but I don't care. Oh, Jimmie crack corn and I don't care. My master's gone away. That's the lyrics. Oh, okay. Lordy, Lordy. Here we go again. You're going again. Same French guy. All right, sir. Hey, Oh, oh. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Oh man. This is your first probability at the 10 I was here, I've been here until 6 AM.

**Speaker:**  
Okay. You could shut up and have a draw.

---
Hello. Hi, Carolyn. This is Scott, obviously. I'm really sorry for missing our Monday meeting
I've been and am in administrative duties hell Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then
I returned to marking hell. So I have done work and I wanted to try and update you and
my typing is quite poor and my spelling is even worse. So I thought one quickly would
just be to send you a recording. So here's a somewhat, I tried to organize my thoughts,
but right. Here's a suit. Here's where I'm at and what I was hoping to have discussed
with you on Monday, but again, I missed it. So I'm, I'm, I'm sorry about that. Okay.
So, bring it up. Here we go. I think the first thing for me when approaching when
re-approaching this, and I think I've got my head around, I've re got my, I've got my head
re around these things. So I start with conceptualization and population, which let me call the setting.
So the first question is what is the population? I think we have a very clear answer to that
is domestic workers in the UK, more technically it is domestic workers in the UK that have
a mobile phone during survey fielding. Maybe that have had a cert that have had a mobile
phone in the calendar year proceeding the survey fielding, something like that. Okay.
So if that's the population, which I think that we're sampling from, which I believe
it is, and I think that's very well defined and that's fantastic. I think the target population,
this hidden population, so to speak, are domestic workers in the UK that have a cell
phone that have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There's
a few ways that we can operationalize that. You and Salim, and me a little bit, but really
it was all you, I think have come up with three very principled ways to do this. The
first two are dichotomies. So this would be a question 36 dichotomized. This is the simply
do you get paid less than the legal minimum wage. And question 80 also dichotomized, which
is have you been through the national referral mechanism, or have you been referred to the
national referral? To my mind, these are both very high bars. Like if people answer yes
truthfully to either of those questions, I think, and I'm not a subject of that expertise
whatsoever, but I think we can be very confident that yes, that person counts as a member of
the hidden population. I think that's true. We also discussed and you and Salim, mainly
you developed a continuous measure. So here the idea, I think, is conceptually different.
So in this third idea, which I think is called, sorry, I took notes and clearly I can, this
is like the some categories or some cut. The idea is you developed a series of indicators,
it sounds like eight or 12 or 16. And we just sort of normalize them and said, you know,
how many of these indicators, and actually there was a waiting to them, do you satisfied,
and then we're going to come up with some number between zero and one that represents your
exposure to the risk of experiencing modern slavery. So this can, if we use that as a
measurement, as a separate measurement, as a continuous measurement of not experiencing
modern slavery, but risk of experiencing modern slavery, that might sound like I'm splitting
hairs, but I think both methodologically in terms of dichotomies versus continuous,
but more importantly, I think conceptually, those are quite different, because in the latter
case, if we're, if we claim that we're measuring risk of exposure, then, then I think the population
is to be a little bit re, well, then the hidden population definitely needs to be redefined.
So the V population that we're sampling premise still domestic workers in the UK that have
a cell phone, yada, yada, yada. But in this third continuous operationalization of experiencing
modern slavery or more formally risk, let's call it a risk index, and I've called it like
24 different things, and I'm sorry. But in that world, we're asserting that everyone in
the population has some value of this variable. That is to say, everyone in the population,
domestic workers in the UK that we're sampling from, have some risk of experiencing modern
slavery, then that risk might be zero. Okay, fine. So, but, but again, conceptually, I think
that's important. Okay. So one, don't know if that's correct or not, but that's where I'm,
that's one, that's where I started with. Okay. So then, so we've got the population, we've got
the target population. So now how are we sampling? So where is this data coming from? So this, we
sort of spent a few rounds and months on this, but I think it was productive, although perhaps not
what you wanted to hear or I wanted to hear or whatnot. But I think where we landed was, well,
look, what do we have? We have a convenient sample. We have an RDS sample, a respondent-driven
survey in which the respondents are members of the population. We're sampling from domestic workers
in the UK that have a cell phone, right? Yada, yada, yada. We're sampling from that population.
Initially, there are seeds and then we're doing an RDS with five coupons to,
to, to branch out, to do the, the RDS or the, the, the modified snowballs, not exactly snowballs,
whatever. Okay. Again, these are my beliefs. So please, right, correct me if, if, if, if I'm
wrong. Okay. So that's the data that we have to work with. So now the question is, what do we
do with that data? I want to add one additional aspect to the, the data, the, the sample I should
say, let me separate that from the data we're talking about in a second. In, in that functionally,
the sample, again, none of this is criticism whatsoever, but functionally, the sample comes from
three groups or we're sampling from three subgroups within the population of domestic
workers in the UK that have a cell phone. Those are people from the Philippines, maybe they're here
on a visa, maybe they just identify as Philippine, no, Filipina. Latinx, again, by self-identified
origin, ethnicity, I don't remember the exact wording and other, and, and British born. And
that one, British born, I think pretty sure is a, is a, is actually asked. I don't have the question
number on, on me. So if we wanted to, we could say, okay, well, look, there's really within this
here sample, there's three distinct clusters by say, nationality. I think we, I think we could
assert that with veracity. It's been a long few days and it's only Tuesday. I'm sorry. Okay. So
that these natural three subgroups or clusters, Latinx, Filipino a and, and British born, I think.
Okay. All right. So that's the sample. So then let me, we've got, I hope you're drinking a lot of tea
or coffee and pausing and or deleting this video. Okay. So then before I get to analysis, I want to do
a few data issues. So, so one, do we know anything about these sizes? So do we know anything about
estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK? So I found two websites once
one's official UK is nationalcareers.service.gov.uk job groups. So they sort of,
I'm guessing it's census based, but they're, they're these job groupings. And another is from
some organization in the UK called BICS. I've already forgotten what that stands for. But
it looks like there's some maybe a sense of the number of domestic workers in the UK. It depends
on how you count like these, you know, is this home cleaning? Is it daycare? Is it institutionalized?
Is it not? And like I said, this is just a very preliminary thing. Okay. So that's one numbers.
One A numbers. Well, actually, we could estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from
your very clever sample because of the RDS nature. So one of the questions in the survey is how many
other domestic workers do you know in the UK? And then ask for some, some recruitment information.
But just asking the how many. So basically what I'm saying is we're sampling from the population
of domestic workers in the UK. And one of the questions is how many other people in this
population do you know? So we can use that information to estimate the size of the population
where the population means domestic workers in the UK. Okay. So that's another that's I'm exploring
that currently as a possible additional source of information. By the way, that is using older,
I'm just saying this for the record. Sorry. So that's using sort of the the
uh, guile at all, but the early stuff. So 2010, 2011, uh, stuff that the stuff we'll talk about
in a second. The for analysis is a bit later 2014, 2015, a bit later. Okay. So what I'm saying is
the population, we can try and estimate the size of the number of domestic workers in the UK,
which might be of interest for a number of reasons. For me is of interest because we need that number
for later calculations and that can come from a few sources. I found two online, maybe they're
valid, maybe they're not. The third is we could try and estimate that from your survey. I'm working
on that currently, but it's giving weird answers. Like it's way too small and it's taking way too
long to run. So whatever, I'm just saying that for the record. Okay. Now I don't remember what number
we're up to. Analysis. Uh, so step one, let's just take it from the literature. Let's do the
guile at all. So this is the so-called SSPS. So this is the successive sampling population size
estimates. And uh, Krista Guile, who again, small world, we were neighbors at it in our postdoc at
doctor comes up with this very clever way of exploiting additional information within RDS
samples that essentially takes into account. What's really cool about it is that it uses
when, at which wave did you appear in the sample as an additional piece of information?
And the idea being that those with larger personal networks, so if I'm a seed and I give two recruits,
odds are those two recruits have bigger social networks than say the other people
that I didn't recruit. Basically, that's the idea and, and so on and so forth. Okay. So it uses this
idea, which overcomes it. It mitigates a lot of biases that were in so-called RDA1 and RDA2,
sorry, RDS1 and RDS2. I've also seen it called RDSA and RDSB volts, etc, etc, etc. So this SSPSC
seems to be, as far as I can tell, pretty, pretty state of the art. Okay. So we can just take that
from the literature. We can do estimation. There's a few hiccups, but nothing that we can't overcome.
And we get proportions. We get proportions of the population, which currently we don't know the
size of, but we can come up with some sensible ways of estimating it that are experiencing,
that are in the hidden population, that are experiencing modern slavery, however defined,
via Q36 or Q80, both dichotomized, which again, to my mind, are very sort of high bars. Like,
if you're saying yes to either Q36 or Q80, again, dichotomized, like, there's very good,
if you're answering honestly, there's very, very good reasons to think that
you're a member of the hidden population, that you're a domestic worker in the UK with a cell
phone, mobile phone, sorry, American, that is being exploited, that is, that is experiencing
modern slavery. Okay. So we can do that. And then there's, there's some sort of very, very recent,
most recent I found was the McLaughlin at all, 2023. I don't even know if I've sent it around.
Sorry if I haven't. That says, yeah, yeah, that's great. But essentially, the number of people that
I report, it's really clever. It says basically, the number, I might not know the number of people
that I know. And so the number of people that I report shouldn't be taken too literally. Essentially,
you should be taken, sort of what they do is they just add a measurement error components. They say,
yeah, well, you might not actually know, you might not truthfully report the number of people that
you know that, that are in your personal network, that are in our world, that are domestic workers
in the UK that have such and such characteristics. Okay, so we can do all that. And I have done,
done that. And, and the answer is really high proportions, something like 30 to 40%.
Depending on a few, you know, which question we use, priors, which model, etc, etc. But
pretty consistently 30 to 40%. Sorry, let me say differently.
And concurrent with the preliminary stuff I sent, whatever it was, months ago,
something like 30, 40% of domestic workers in the UK, if that's the population,
we are estimating to be experiencing modern slavery again, depending on how we're defining it.
It's one of these two dichotomous, dichotomous variables. And, and again, you know, those
caveats, however, I will say this, I was worried about a few things. Because when I first saw that,
I thought, wow, that's really high. I thought. So maybe there's some convergence issues,
doesn't look like it looks like the things have converged pretty well.
This is embarrassing, I got, this reminds me that when I was younger, my parents would
call me the voicemail and sometimes my dad especially would just ramble and the voicemail
would cut off, he would have expired the maximal amount.
I think that just happened to me, I've been rambling at you for more than the allotted
time that Microsoft is letting me and yet here I go again.
So I'll do my best to try and send along some kind of summary transcript.
I'm sorry, this is me trying desperately to stay current and catch up on research of which
this is literally the number one priority and you see it that I'm already falling behind.
So I'm really sorry about that.
Okay, right, blah, blah, blah.
Where were we?
So there are these estimates and they seem, I believe them more than I did when I first
sent the preliminaries around.
Now there's still stuff to do, there's still robustness, this, that and the other, but these
numbers seem pretty high.
Okay, again, 30 to 40%, something like that.
Now there's a few caveats here, well I need to say caveats, there's a few things I need
to say.
The first is, I should have said earlier, isn't about the analysis, it's about the data
and data cleaning, so one thing and much appreciation to Salim, he's done a ton of work, but one
is, and this turns out to be a bit of a subtle issue at least in political science, so one
is how do you deal with the don't knows?
So some of the questions, for example, one of the questions, one of our indicator questions
about are you in this hidden population, how are you experiencing modern slavery, is
about referral to the national referral mechanism.
And one of the response answers is, for I don't know.
So the issue is, how do you deal with those?
And those I don't know sort of pop up and obviously in lots of other questions.
Currently in Salim's formulation, they're being coded as in the negative, no I'm not
whatever the question is asking, something just happened, oh my god, I feel like I'm
like one of the worst colleagues, I'm so sorry.
So an alternative approach is to classify them as missing, so essentially you say, well
look, if a person reports, I don't know if I've been referred to the national referral
mechanism, we're just going to ignore you for purposes of analysis.
We're not going to count you as no I haven't been referred.
So doing that actually weirdly increases very slightly the estimates of domestic workers
in the UK experiencing modern slavery.
So Salim's descriptive statistics were, if you do what I'm suggesting, which is to
treat the don't knows differently from either an affirmative or a negative, you get ever
so slightly higher descriptive statistics, higher proportions just raw from the sample
data.
And it's something, you know, it's like 42 to 44, 42 to 43 or something like this, I
mean it's not, they're not huge.
That's one issue too, this one's a bit trickier, 17 out of 97 people in the sample report knowing
zero domestic workers in the UK.
So that one of the questions that, in fact the question, I should be more clear, I'm
sorry Caroline, I'll try and clean up in the transcript, in the summary of the transcript,
say I know zero people in the population, which we've defined to be, if I'm thinking
about this correctly, domestic workers in the UK.
Right.
Okay.
Okay, so maybe they do, maybe that's true or maybe they don't, but then in terms of
this data cleaning business, but then some of them make referrals.
So among the 17 that say I know zero domestic workers in the UK, there's another question
that says, please give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK that you know,
where no is defined properly per your survey, and they'll give a cell phone number or two.
Which again, this is like a logical inconsistency, if you report a referral, and a referral
must be a domestic worker in the UK, then you cannot know zero domestic workers in the
UK.
So there's a few people in the survey like that.
So those zero, essentially what I'm saying is those zeros should actually be something
positive.
We don't actually know, but a conservative answer would be turn those zeros into ones.
So I haven't done that, but it's a handful of people.
I can't imagine it's going to matter, but there's a larger issue which is what to do
with these zeros.
So if you claim that you know zero, if a person in the sample claims they know zero domestic
workers in the UK, and like I said, there's 17 or so out of 97, so it's not nothing.
What do we do with those?
And the reason I say that is because the estimators that I've been using essentially
can't handle the zeros.
And the reason for that I hadn't thought very deeply about, but I guess kind of makes sense
in the following way.
The estimators that we're dealing with just extensively rely on social network information.
And so if there's a person in your sample that says essentially I have, I don't have
a social network, zero, then that causes some problems because the entire estimation
strategy of these different techniques are to exploit, are to use whatever social network
there is.
But if that's zero, then something breaks.
And to be honest, I haven't worked through the math.
So what do we do with those?
We could remove them.
Turns out that doesn't really matter too much.
We could try other techniques.
I haven't fully explored that.
I've explored that a little, and I don't really know what to make of it.
Or we could just really add hawk, like just add one to everybody's reported degree.
So all the zeros turn into ones, all the fives turn into sixes.
That's not principled whatsoever.
But it's another approach.
Okay.
So that's data stuff.
All right.
Now, with regard to results, which again, I've completely misordered this and hopefully
it will be temporarily correct in the accompanying outline should I get around to producing it.
So this 30, 40% business that I mentioned earlier, like I said, I believe it more than
I did when I sent you the initial plumber results, which were relatively similar.
The little convergence results, so we have this estimate that's doing a lot of math.
And the idea is it comes up with lots and lots and lots of estimates.
But when all these estimates get very, very close to each other, the algorithm stops and
says, okay, here it is.
And so you can look and see, you know, does it actually do that?
And the answer is yes.
It converges.
Okay.
So I'm relatively, I'm more confident in the numbers on resolve that.
Okay.
So what am I, I'm sorry, I need to look at, right.
So the number one is just, do we believe these results?
I've checked convergence preliminarily, it looks pretty good.
We could do sensitivity analysis.
That would be on me.
I've done a little bit of that.
And again, it seems, in my opinion, surprisingly robust, like, I don't remember my discussion
about frequentist versus Bayesian, but the idea is you put some prior information into
this, into this, into this estimator, like, for example, how many domestic workers are
there in the UK?
What is the size of the population?
Now, we don't know that number, but we have some belief about it.
The beliefs I've been using are something like 1.74 million, say 2 million, whatever.
So you can change that number.
And the resulting estimates are very, very similar, again, in this 30, 40% range.
There are other techniques.
So the techniques I've been using all assume that the graph is connected.
So what that means is that if we were to know everybody's social network, which we don't,
but if we were to know all of it, it's connected.
So functioning with that means is that if there's a Ecuadorian in our sample, that truly,
if we had the entire social network of all domestic workers in the UK, which we don't,
if we did, there'd be some path for that there domestic worker from Ecuador to any other
person, any other domestic worker in the UK, in particular to the Filipino worker who might
be in our sample or might not, to the British born, the British national, whatever.
So truly, they're all connected.
Now, I think I mentioned this, but there's, I think there's some reasons to think that
might not be true, that there really, there might be clusters or subgroups here, primarily
around language, I would guess, again, this isn't, I'm not a subject of expert, but that's,
so that's fine.
There are techniques to deal with that.
So we could, and I haven't, but we could pretty straightforwardly deal with, well, maybe there's
a Filipino, Filipino, a network, and maybe there's a Spanish speaking network, or maybe
there's a UK born network, and maybe those are different.
Maybe they're not, maybe they're all connected.
But we could, one might say, well, I don't really think that they're all connected.
So that's fine.
We can deal with that.
I haven't, but, but, but we can.
Okay.
So that's one thing.
So disaggregate by origin.
We got that.
Yeah.
Like I said, it's, it's, in my opinion, shockingly high.
And so, you know, there's the whole, do we believe it?
Oh, and then, right.
Okay.
So then there's a, there's, there's an entirely separate, to my mind, this is a third sort
of approach or strata estimation strategy, which is so far everything I've talked about
is sort of off the shelf RDS.
It's very sophisticated and involves tweaks, like visibility and measurement error, yada,
yada, yada, yada, yada, but it's very, our sample is RDS.
And we're trying to estimate the size of some population slash hidden population slash members
of the population with some particular categorical attribute, et cetera, which again, perfectly
fine fits the data fantastically.
It's not at all what I thought we initially started this project with, which was some
variant of in summer or network scale up in particular, you're very, very cool and very
novel idea to use the generalized GN sum here.
So the question is, can we use the data that we have to do some kind of in some ish estimation?
And the reason I'm sort of pushing this or advocating for this is because I think it's
much more.
My guess is it's going to be much more powerful because in some is using more information.
And it's not just, it's not just counting the number of, well, how do I say this?
So in some is very, very powerful.
The issue is if you don't have a random sample, what do you do about that?
And the answer is lots of weird math that essentially boils down to the linchpin for
us is what's called inclusion probabilities.
So we don't have a random sample we acknowledge that that's fine.
So how, what statistical tricks can we do to the data that we have in sample so as to
be able to justify and use techniques that are meant for analysis of random samples like
in some.
Okay, so there's an answer to that and the answer is waiting.
And I think there's some really, really nice intersections here and really pretty straightforward.
I haven't implemented them, but essentially we can use, we can derive weights from these
RDS estimators and logic and packages and R to come up with these inclusion probabilities.
And again, we can do a few robustness whatever and then throw use those in the in some calculations.
I haven't done that, but I'm really excited to do that because I think my hunch is that's
going to be much more powerful in that it's just it's sort of taking the best, it's squeezing
all the information that at least I am aware of out of the data that we that we actually
have.
Okay, I've been rambling the combined with that.
So I haven't done that.
So, so me, Scott Moser to do bootstraps, I've done some, I haven't done all of them.
Since the analysis against some, not a bunch, this, this third way, this in some plus RDS
weights, I'm very excited about, haven't touched it, I haven't touched it practically.
I have thought about it and have notes, which are a mess.
Okay, next topic presentation.
What do we want to present?
And how do we want to present it?
Cables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian plus series, what?
I don't know.
And if I'm being perfectly honest with Caroline, I don't, you know, I'm not really right now,
I'm not in a huge position to sort of produce like publication ready graphics or what have
you.
But I think that's a discussion that would help me at least.
Okay, I think I'm about to get cut off again.
So I'm going to stop.
This is what I was hoping to report, discuss, talk about with you on Monday.
And like I said, I had early failed.
Hopefully this has some meaning.
Hello. Hi, Carolyn. This is Scott, obviously. I'm really sorry for missing our Monday meeting
I've been and am in administrative duties hell Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then
I returned to marking hell. So I have done work and I wanted to try and update you and
my typing is quite poor and my spelling is even worse. So I thought one quickly would
just be to send you a recording. So here's a somewhat, I tried to organize my thoughts,
but right. Here's a suit. Here's where I'm at and what I was hoping to have discussed
with you on Monday, but again, I missed it. So I'm, I'm, I'm sorry about that. Okay.
So, bring it up. Here we go. I think the first thing for me when approaching when
re-approaching this, and I think I've got my head around, I've re got my, I've got my head
re around these things. So I start with conceptualization and population, which let me call the setting.
So the first question is what is the population? I think we have a very clear answer to that
is domestic workers in the UK, more technically it is domestic workers in the UK that have
a mobile phone during survey fielding. Maybe that have had a cert that have had a mobile
phone in the calendar year proceeding the survey fielding, something like that. Okay.
So if that's the population, which I think that we're sampling from, which I believe
it is, and I think that's very well defined and that's fantastic. I think the target population,
this hidden population, so to speak, are domestic workers in the UK that have a cell
phone that have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There's
a few ways that we can operationalize that. You and Salim, and me a little bit, but really
it was all you, I think have come up with three very principled ways to do this. The
first two are dichotomies. So this would be a question 36 dichotomized. This is the simply
do you get paid less than the legal minimum wage. And question 80 also dichotomized, which
is have you been through the national referral mechanism, or have you been referred to the
national referral? To my mind, these are both very high bars. Like if people answer yes
truthfully to either of those questions, I think, and I'm not a subject of that expertise
whatsoever, but I think we can be very confident that yes, that person counts as a member of
the hidden population. I think that's true. We also discussed and you and Salim, mainly
you developed a continuous measure. So here the idea, I think, is conceptually different.
So in this third idea, which I think is called, sorry, I took notes and clearly I can, this
is like the some categories or some cut. The idea is you developed a series of indicators,
it sounds like eight or 12 or 16. And we just sort of normalize them and said, you know,
how many of these indicators, and actually there was a waiting to them, do you satisfied,
and then we're going to come up with some number between zero and one that represents your
exposure to the risk of experiencing modern slavery. So this can, if we use that as a
measurement, as a separate measurement, as a continuous measurement of not experiencing
modern slavery, but risk of experiencing modern slavery, that might sound like I'm splitting
hairs, but I think both methodologically in terms of dichotomies versus continuous,
but more importantly, I think conceptually, those are quite different, because in the latter
case, if we're, if we claim that we're measuring risk of exposure, then, then I think the population
is to be a little bit re, well, then the hidden population definitely needs to be redefined.
So the V population that we're sampling premise still domestic workers in the UK that have
a cell phone, yada, yada, yada. But in this third continuous operationalization of experiencing
modern slavery or more formally risk, let's call it a risk index, and I've called it like
24 different things, and I'm sorry. But in that world, we're asserting that everyone in
the population has some value of this variable. That is to say, everyone in the population,
domestic workers in the UK that we're sampling from, have some risk of experiencing modern
slavery, then that risk might be zero. Okay, fine. So, but, but again, conceptually, I think
that's important. Okay. So one, don't know if that's correct or not, but that's where I'm,
that's one, that's where I started with. Okay. So then, so we've got the population, we've got
the target population. So now how are we sampling? So where is this data coming from? So this, we
sort of spent a few rounds and months on this, but I think it was productive, although perhaps not
what you wanted to hear or I wanted to hear or whatnot. But I think where we landed was, well,
look, what do we have? We have a convenient sample. We have an RDS sample, a respondent-driven
survey in which the respondents are members of the population. We're sampling from domestic workers
in the UK that have a cell phone, right? Yada, yada, yada. We're sampling from that population.
Initially, there are seeds and then we're doing an RDS with five coupons to,
to, to branch out, to do the, the RDS or the, the, the modified snowballs, not exactly snowballs,
whatever. Okay. Again, these are my beliefs. So please, right, correct me if, if, if, if I'm
wrong. Okay. So that's the data that we have to work with. So now the question is, what do we
do with that data? I want to add one additional aspect to the, the data, the, the sample I should
say, let me separate that from the data we're talking about in a second. In, in that functionally,
the sample, again, none of this is criticism whatsoever, but functionally, the sample comes from
three groups or we're sampling from three subgroups within the population of domestic
workers in the UK that have a cell phone. Those are people from the Philippines, maybe they're here
on a visa, maybe they just identify as Philippine, no, Filipina. Latinx, again, by self-identified
origin, ethnicity, I don't remember the exact wording and other, and, and British born. And
that one, British born, I think pretty sure is a, is a, is actually asked. I don't have the question
number on, on me. So if we wanted to, we could say, okay, well, look, there's really within this
here sample, there's three distinct clusters by say, nationality. I think we, I think we could
assert that with veracity. It's been a long few days and it's only Tuesday. I'm sorry. Okay. So
that these natural three subgroups or clusters, Latinx, Filipino a and, and British born, I think.
Okay. All right. So that's the sample. So then let me, we've got, I hope you're drinking a lot of tea
or coffee and pausing and or deleting this video. Okay. So then before I get to analysis, I want to do
a few data issues. So, so one, do we know anything about these sizes? So do we know anything about
estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK? So I found two websites once
one's official UK is nationalcareers.service.gov.uk job groups. So they sort of,
I'm guessing it's census based, but they're, they're these job groupings. And another is from
some organization in the UK called BICS. I've already forgotten what that stands for. But
it looks like there's some maybe a sense of the number of domestic workers in the UK. It depends
on how you count like these, you know, is this home cleaning? Is it daycare? Is it institutionalized?
Is it not? And like I said, this is just a very preliminary thing. Okay. So that's one numbers.
One A numbers. Well, actually, we could estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from
your very clever sample because of the RDS nature. So one of the questions in the survey is how many
other domestic workers do you know in the UK? And then ask for some, some recruitment information.
But just asking the how many. So basically what I'm saying is we're sampling from the population
of domestic workers in the UK. And one of the questions is how many other people in this
population do you know? So we can use that information to estimate the size of the population
where the population means domestic workers in the UK. Okay. So that's another that's I'm exploring
that currently as a possible additional source of information. By the way, that is using older,
I'm just saying this for the record. Sorry. So that's using sort of the the
uh, guile at all, but the early stuff. So 2010, 2011, uh, stuff that the stuff we'll talk about
in a second. The for analysis is a bit later 2014, 2015, a bit later. Okay. So what I'm saying is
the population, we can try and estimate the size of the number of domestic workers in the UK,
which might be of interest for a number of reasons. For me is of interest because we need that number
for later calculations and that can come from a few sources. I found two online, maybe they're
valid, maybe they're not. The third is we could try and estimate that from your survey. I'm working
on that currently, but it's giving weird answers. Like it's way too small and it's taking way too
long to run. So whatever, I'm just saying that for the record. Okay. Now I don't remember what number
we're up to. Analysis. Uh, so step one, let's just take it from the literature. Let's do the
guile at all. So this is the so-called SSPS. So this is the successive sampling population size
estimates. And uh, Krista Guile, who again, small world, we were neighbors at it in our postdoc at
doctor comes up with this very clever way of exploiting additional information within RDS
samples that essentially takes into account. What's really cool about it is that it uses
when, at which wave did you appear in the sample as an additional piece of information?
And the idea being that those with larger personal networks, so if I'm a seed and I give two recruits,
odds are those two recruits have bigger social networks than say the other people
that I didn't recruit. Basically, that's the idea and, and so on and so forth. Okay. So it uses this
idea, which overcomes it. It mitigates a lot of biases that were in so-called RDA1 and RDA2,
sorry, RDS1 and RDS2. I've also seen it called RDSA and RDSB volts, etc, etc, etc. So this SSPSC
seems to be, as far as I can tell, pretty, pretty state of the art. Okay. So we can just take that
from the literature. We can do estimation. There's a few hiccups, but nothing that we can't overcome.
And we get proportions. We get proportions of the population, which currently we don't know the
size of, but we can come up with some sensible ways of estimating it that are experiencing,
that are in the hidden population, that are experiencing modern slavery, however defined,
via Q36 or Q80, both dichotomized, which again, to my mind, are very sort of high bars. Like,
if you're saying yes to either Q36 or Q80, again, dichotomized, like, there's very good,
if you're answering honestly, there's very, very good reasons to think that
you're a member of the hidden population, that you're a domestic worker in the UK with a cell
phone, mobile phone, sorry, American, that is being exploited, that is, that is experiencing
modern slavery. Okay. So we can do that. And then there's, there's some sort of very, very recent,
most recent I found was the McLaughlin at all, 2023. I don't even know if I've sent it around.
Sorry if I haven't. That says, yeah, yeah, that's great. But essentially, the number of people that
I report, it's really clever. It says basically, the number, I might not know the number of people
that I know. And so the number of people that I report shouldn't be taken too literally. Essentially,
you should be taken, sort of what they do is they just add a measurement error components. They say,
yeah, well, you might not actually know, you might not truthfully report the number of people that
you know that, that are in your personal network, that are in our world, that are domestic workers
in the UK that have such and such characteristics. Okay, so we can do all that. And I have done,
done that. And, and the answer is really high proportions, something like 30 to 40%.
Depending on a few, you know, which question we use, priors, which model, etc, etc. But
pretty consistently 30 to 40%. Sorry, let me say differently.
And concurrent with the preliminary stuff I sent, whatever it was, months ago,
something like 30, 40% of domestic workers in the UK, if that's the population,
we are estimating to be experiencing modern slavery again, depending on how we're defining it.
It's one of these two dichotomous, dichotomous variables. And, and again, you know, those
caveats, however, I will say this, I was worried about a few things. Because when I first saw that,
I thought, wow, that's really high. I thought. So maybe there's some convergence issues,
doesn't look like it looks like the things have converged pretty well.

This is embarrassing, I got, this reminds me that when I was younger, my parents would
call me the voicemail and sometimes my dad especially would just ramble and the voicemail
would cut off, he would have expired the maximal amount.
I think that just happened to me, I've been rambling at you for more than the allotted
time that Microsoft is letting me and yet here I go again.
So I'll do my best to try and send along some kind of summary transcript.
I'm sorry, this is me trying desperately to stay current and catch up on research of which
this is literally the number one priority and you see it that I'm already falling behind.
So I'm really sorry about that.
Okay, right, blah, blah, blah.
Where were we?
So there are these estimates and they seem, I believe them more than I did when I first
sent the preliminaries around.
Now there's still stuff to do, there's still robustness, this, that and the other, but these
numbers seem pretty high.
Okay, again, 30 to 40%, something like that.
Now there's a few caveats here, well I need to say caveats, there's a few things I need
to say.
The first is, I should have said earlier, isn't about the analysis, it's about the data
and data cleaning, so one thing and much appreciation to Salim, he's done a ton of work, but one
is, and this turns out to be a bit of a subtle issue at least in political science, so one
is how do you deal with the don't knows?
So some of the questions, for example, one of the questions, one of our indicator questions
about are you in this hidden population, how are you experiencing modern slavery, is
about referral to the national referral mechanism.
And one of the response answers is, for I don't know.
So the issue is, how do you deal with those?
And those I don't know sort of pop up and obviously in lots of other questions.
Currently in Salim's formulation, they're being coded as in the negative, no I'm not
whatever the question is asking, something just happened, oh my god, I feel like I'm
like one of the worst colleagues, I'm so sorry.
So an alternative approach is to classify them as missing, so essentially you say, well
look, if a person reports, I don't know if I've been referred to the national referral
mechanism, we're just going to ignore you for purposes of analysis.
We're not going to count you as no I haven't been referred.
So doing that actually weirdly increases very slightly the estimates of domestic workers
in the UK experiencing modern slavery.
So Salim's descriptive statistics were, if you do what I'm suggesting, which is to
treat the don't knows differently from either an affirmative or a negative, you get ever
so slightly higher descriptive statistics, higher proportions just raw from the sample
data.
And it's something, you know, it's like 42 to 44, 42 to 43 or something like this, I
mean it's not, they're not huge.
That's one issue too, this one's a bit trickier, 17 out of 97 people in the sample report knowing
zero domestic workers in the UK.
So that one of the questions that, in fact the question, I should be more clear, I'm
sorry Caroline, I'll try and clean up in the transcript, in the summary of the transcript,
say I know zero people in the population, which we've defined to be, if I'm thinking
about this correctly, domestic workers in the UK.
Right.
Okay.
Okay, so maybe they do, maybe that's true or maybe they don't, but then in terms of
this data cleaning business, but then some of them make referrals.
So among the 17 that say I know zero domestic workers in the UK, there's another question
that says, please give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK that you know,
where no is defined properly per your survey, and they'll give a cell phone number or two.
Which again, this is like a logical inconsistency, if you report a referral, and a referral
must be a domestic worker in the UK, then you cannot know zero domestic workers in the
UK.
So there's a few people in the survey like that.
So those zero, essentially what I'm saying is those zeros should actually be something
positive.
We don't actually know, but a conservative answer would be turn those zeros into ones.
So I haven't done that, but it's a handful of people.
I can't imagine it's going to matter, but there's a larger issue which is what to do
with these zeros.
So if you claim that you know zero, if a person in the sample claims they know zero domestic
workers in the UK, and like I said, there's 17 or so out of 97, so it's not nothing.
What do we do with those?
And the reason I say that is because the estimators that I've been using essentially
can't handle the zeros.
And the reason for that I hadn't thought very deeply about, but I guess kind of makes sense
in the following way.
The estimators that we're dealing with just extensively rely on social network information.
And so if there's a person in your sample that says essentially I have, I don't have
a social network, zero, then that causes some problems because the entire estimation
strategy of these different techniques are to exploit, are to use whatever social network
there is.
But if that's zero, then something breaks.
And to be honest, I haven't worked through the math.
So what do we do with those?
We could remove them.
Turns out that doesn't really matter too much.
We could try other techniques.
I haven't fully explored that.
I've explored that a little, and I don't really know what to make of it.
Or we could just really add hawk, like just add one to everybody's reported degree.
So all the zeros turn into ones, all the fives turn into sixes.
That's not principled whatsoever.
But it's another approach.
Okay.
So that's data stuff.
All right.
Now, with regard to results, which again, I've completely misordered this and hopefully
it will be temporarily correct in the accompanying outline should I get around to producing it.
So this 30, 40% business that I mentioned earlier, like I said, I believe it more than
I did when I sent you the initial plumber results, which were relatively similar.
The little convergence results, so we have this estimate that's doing a lot of math.
And the idea is it comes up with lots and lots and lots of estimates.
But when all these estimates get very, very close to each other, the algorithm stops and
says, okay, here it is.
And so you can look and see, you know, does it actually do that?
And the answer is yes.
It converges.
Okay.
So I'm relatively, I'm more confident in the numbers on resolve that.
Okay.
So what am I, I'm sorry, I need to look at, right.
So the number one is just, do we believe these results?
I've checked convergence preliminarily, it looks pretty good.
We could do sensitivity analysis.
That would be on me.
I've done a little bit of that.
And again, it seems, in my opinion, surprisingly robust, like, I don't remember my discussion
about frequentist versus Bayesian, but the idea is you put some prior information into
this, into this, into this estimator, like, for example, how many domestic workers are
there in the UK?
What is the size of the population?
Now, we don't know that number, but we have some belief about it.
The beliefs I've been using are something like 1.74 million, say 2 million, whatever.
So you can change that number.
And the resulting estimates are very, very similar, again, in this 30, 40% range.
There are other techniques.
So the techniques I've been using all assume that the graph is connected.
So what that means is that if we were to know everybody's social network, which we don't,
but if we were to know all of it, it's connected.
So functioning with that means is that if there's a Ecuadorian in our sample, that truly,
if we had the entire social network of all domestic workers in the UK, which we don't,
if we did, there'd be some path for that there domestic worker from Ecuador to any other
person, any other domestic worker in the UK, in particular to the Filipino worker who might
be in our sample or might not, to the British born, the British national, whatever.
So truly, they're all connected.
Now, I think I mentioned this, but there's, I think there's some reasons to think that
might not be true, that there really, there might be clusters or subgroups here, primarily
around language, I would guess, again, this isn't, I'm not a subject of expert, but that's,
so that's fine.
There are techniques to deal with that.
So we could, and I haven't, but we could pretty straightforwardly deal with, well, maybe there's
a Filipino, Filipino, a network, and maybe there's a Spanish speaking network, or maybe
there's a UK born network, and maybe those are different.
Maybe they're not, maybe they're all connected.
But we could, one might say, well, I don't really think that they're all connected.
So that's fine.
We can deal with that.
I haven't, but, but, but we can.
Okay.
So that's one thing.
So disaggregate by origin.
We got that.
Yeah.
Like I said, it's, it's, in my opinion, shockingly high.
And so, you know, there's the whole, do we believe it?
Oh, and then, right.
Okay.
So then there's a, there's, there's an entirely separate, to my mind, this is a third sort
of approach or strata estimation strategy, which is so far everything I've talked about
is sort of off the shelf RDS.
It's very sophisticated and involves tweaks, like visibility and measurement error, yada,
yada, yada, yada, yada, but it's very, our sample is RDS.
And we're trying to estimate the size of some population slash hidden population slash members
of the population with some particular categorical attribute, et cetera, which again, perfectly
fine fits the data fantastically.
It's not at all what I thought we initially started this project with, which was some
variant of in summer or network scale up in particular, you're very, very cool and very
novel idea to use the generalized GN sum here.
So the question is, can we use the data that we have to do some kind of in some ish estimation?
And the reason I'm sort of pushing this or advocating for this is because I think it's
much more.
My guess is it's going to be much more powerful because in some is using more information.
And it's not just, it's not just counting the number of, well, how do I say this?
So in some is very, very powerful.
The issue is if you don't have a random sample, what do you do about that?
And the answer is lots of weird math that essentially boils down to the linchpin for
us is what's called inclusion probabilities.
So we don't have a random sample we acknowledge that that's fine.
So how, what statistical tricks can we do to the data that we have in sample so as to
be able to justify and use techniques that are meant for analysis of random samples like
in some.
Okay, so there's an answer to that and the answer is waiting.
And I think there's some really, really nice intersections here and really pretty straightforward.
I haven't implemented them, but essentially we can use, we can derive weights from these
RDS estimators and logic and packages and R to come up with these inclusion probabilities.
And again, we can do a few robustness whatever and then throw use those in the in some calculations.
I haven't done that, but I'm really excited to do that because I think my hunch is that's
going to be much more powerful in that it's just it's sort of taking the best, it's squeezing
all the information that at least I am aware of out of the data that we that we actually
have.
Okay, I've been rambling the combined with that.
So I haven't done that.
So, so me, Scott Moser to do bootstraps, I've done some, I haven't done all of them.
Since the analysis against some, not a bunch, this, this third way, this in some plus RDS
weights, I'm very excited about, haven't touched it, I haven't touched it practically.
I have thought about it and have notes, which are a mess.
Okay, next topic presentation.
What do we want to present?
And how do we want to present it?
Cables, graphs, distributions, confidence intervals, Bayesian plus series, what?
I don't know.
And if I'm being perfectly honest with Caroline, I don't, you know, I'm not really right now,
I'm not in a huge position to sort of produce like publication ready graphics or what have
you.
But I think that's a discussion that would help me at least.
Okay, I think I'm about to get cut off again.
So I'm going to stop.
This is what I was hoping to report, discuss, talk about with you on Monday.
And like I said, I had early failed.
Hopefully this has some meaning.

I can't. I came on last Saturday. Okay.
Hello.
Good afternoon, everybody. How are you?
Good.
Hi. Good to see you.
And you.
Yeah, go ahead, please, Caroline. I'm not prepared.
Yeah, I was going to say, thank you for your email. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking.
It's just a way of trying to keep an aid memoir, isn't it?
Of where we're up to with this, really. So it was really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought.
Yeah, I think so.
We might have a path forward from what you're saying.
Yeah, honestly, that sounds really good.
I had to write everything down because I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that email.
Yeah. No, I'll keep talking while you're looking for it.
Please, thank you.
And interestingly, the Norck paper that you mentioned in it, I think that that is the first of two studies that they've done.
Okay. And we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I shared with you was the second study they've done a cohort study.
So now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional, but we've tried to track down both reports.
Small world, yeah.
But I think we know what they're publishing anyway, and that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the Gile, is it Gile?
Yeah.
But I will read that. And that will be useful for just putting the literature related to RDS together.
Yeah, I think so.
And Selim has done a fantastic job, I think, in actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started.
So I think we've made some pretty good progress this week.
Good.
So I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings.
Yes.
Like that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the email, Scott?
Or do you want to chat with them?
Chat about the risk assessment?
Yeah, if you don't mind, please do. I'm so sorry. Yeah, so sorry, please, please.
Now, we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then.
Right.
So what I tried to do, Selim, as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right, but there are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally.
And Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning weight so that overall they would add up to one.
That's effectively an index of no exploitation through to every form of exploitation we could think of.
And we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there may be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process.
But from what you're saying in your emails, Selim, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation.
Yeah, that's right. So I have gone through these steps that you have sent me in your email last Friday, and they all, 97 people, you know, so we have some level of exploitation.
And if you go to the Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night, you can see when you go to the column, some categories, so you can see that 0.366, 0.2, 0.1, and that continues.
And as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13 categories that we have asked our respondents.
Yeah, so the question that I had, and forgive me if I misunderstood this, but we, when we put the measures together, there were some that were sort of composite measures.
So there were the 13 sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement, where there were two or three together.
So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding, Selim, or have you just done a sort of all or nothing coding?
I've done all or nothing coding. So is this the, I mean, I didn't attend last week the meeting. Is this a complication then?
Well, this is, I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this input.
I mean, definitely, you've answered the first question was how many people in the sample experienced any form of exploitation and we know.
Because of the way we've selected organisations to approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation, and not just generic people working in the sector.
So that I think is good for our clarity of our method.
And I suppose the question is, could we, or do we want to, do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got?
Because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've designed the measures is just purely a cumulative sum.
But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub-totals almost.
I have a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run.
I'm sorry.
How you, how you sort of conceptualise the risk index?
First cup of coffee, so apologies to all, but I'm not exactly, so I see there's what 13 categories, is that right? Some number of categories.
13 categories, and saline's, for each person, saline's indicated the extent to which they fit in that category.
And the categories in the Word document are, oh I see, the categories aren't individual questions, they're compilations of questions.
Is that correct?
In some cases.
In some cases.
It's not always, we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have.
Okay, and then, so sorry, give me a second.
So Saline, how did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet?
So Caroline sent me the email, I think you have been also included in the same email, so I'm just, I think I'm just sharing it, this will solidify the communication.
Can you see that?
Yeah, that's exactly what I have, yeah.
Yeah, so I, so going back to the question, let's start here.
For example, this would be category one, yeah, category one, and we have our question, and for that question we have more answers in this survey.
We don't have only yes, always, often, or sometimes there's also no, never, and so on.
So, but as long as they answer one of these responses, they have been forced to do work against their will.
Right.
Back to the question.
And that will be done, weighted with 0.25.
Yeah.
What do you mean weighted by 0.25?
So it's like 0.25 times 0.025.
0.025.
So that's a proportion of the total index of one. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk, so that there was a sort of cumulative effect.
So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding, silly correctly, when you look at risk category one, silly, that was designed to be those two questions together.
Yeah.
And you see, because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability.
Yeah.
So that would give you a composite weighting.
So if you answered the first question, and in any of those responses, you get 0.25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further 0.25.
Just make 0.05.
Yeah.
Yeah, just what I have done.
Yeah.
So as Karen and I said, we have your two questions.
And if the respondent, our respondent has responded for both of these questions, then they will get a weighting for each 0.025.
And some of this would be, for this question, 0.05. And that continues.
So for all questions, so here, for example, would be, again, 0.05. Here we have, again, two questions.
So it will be 0.025, 0.025.
If they have been part of that indicator for exploitation, then they will get a weighting of 0.05.
And this goes back to the beginning.
So Caroline has let weighting for all our questions in a way that is first 0.35, 0.55.
And at the bottom is also 0.10.
So in total, this makes them one.
Yeah.
So that's what I sort of entered from our conversation last week, Scott.
Yeah.
That's what I creatively designed.
Gotcha.
Thank you.
I'm hoping that I've interpreted it properly.
Right.
And then, yes, and then the, I don't know what you want to cook.
So hang on.
So it's category one.
So I don't want to, I don't know how to describe this to the different.
So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't.
And I just want to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you, you've selected those weights, not 0.35 for category 13.
Yeah.
And you've done that on a qualitatively done on the basis of the extent to which you did indicate exploitation, serious exploitation.
So that we've got the middle block that saline's got on the screen where those are all indicators of forced labor risk.
And there's a sort of cumulative effect.
So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk.
And so I've allowed, there were about 11 of those indicators.
So it just made sense sort of mathematics or arithmetic lead to get a total of 0.55.
By assigning this, these smaller weights to each composite measure.
In addition to that, we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is a more objective measure of exploitation, because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that person is experiencing exploitation.
So we've only got one question on that.
But actually that's a stronger indicator because it applied. It's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that 0.35 on its own.
So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing exploit.
One, which is this, I wanted a point one.
So this is payment below the national living wage.
So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be, it could be a exploitation, but it isn't always.
So that's why I've waited at a lower level.
So I could make a narrative argument for why I put those weightings in.
But there's some convenience in making sure that they will add up to one.
Yeah.
But there is some sort of logic behind it.
Yeah, that's great.
So then just few more questions if I can.
So the.
So category 12 is this is like you were saying is like the suggestive, but not definitive indicator.
But it gets a weight of not point one, which is twice the weight of say, category 11.
Right.
So why that confuses me is if it's if if if category 12 is the loosest, wouldn't we down weight it relative to the other categories.
With the other indicator, it can be illegal.
I suppose this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially illegal exploitation.
That's true.
It's true.
Okay.
Whereas excessive overtime.
Yeah.
Not necessarily illegal.
Okay.
I agree it's arguable.
No, no, but I just, it's fine.
It's fine.
I'm understanding all the, all the, the, the not point fives and sorry, not point not fives.
Excuse me.
And so, so all the category, no, that's not true.
All the categories in the middle block get not point not five.
Yeah.
11 indicators of forced labor and for each indicator, it's not point 05.
And that's where the not point five five comes from is because you're okay.
Good.
And in category 13, it's, it's weighted, it stated it's weighted at not point three five,
but it's also stated it's weighted at not point four.
No, it is, isn't it?
That's true.
Which one of those is wrong?
So, which one did you use?
Did you use the point three five?
I've done that.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's a typo.
That's no problem.
That's no problem.
That's great.
Thank you.
So thank you.
So now I understand this.
So, so now, now I'm able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is,
if I'm understanding it, do you, do you want to combine categories?
Is that what you're, so for example, we have, um, go, sorry, sorry.
I think Salim's done it.
I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these
13 categories.
I'm right on time.
Salim, you have done it that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that's a good question.
The, the, the, yeah.
The indicators into those questions.
Good.
Okay.
And we're, I'm totally comfortable with that.
Is that as, do we need any other aggregation?
Sorry.
I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one?
Some category.
No, I'm happy with exactly, I'm happy with what you've done.
I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite
measures, but we do.
So that's perfect.
Good.
Okay.
I'm, I'm happy with that.
If you all are, I think that's, I think that's great.
Um, good, good.
So, and then for each of these, we get, there's some distribution of this
risk, which is great.
No problem.
Good.
Good.
And there's no, there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level.
Is there.
So, for example, combine categories.
That's what I understood your question to be Caroline.
But now I see, I, I'm mistaken.
That's not what you were saying.
So, sorry.
You mean if there was, um, evidence of low payment and forced labor and
NRM, I mean, we've got that in the summation, haven't we?
Yeah, you're right.
All the information's there.
You could just, you would just, if you wanted higher levels of
aggregation, you would just add up those categories on their own.
Yep.
Yep.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.
Got it.
That's good.
That's good.
Good.
Thank you.
Good game.
This is the data that we need.
And you have provided it.
So that's great.
Yeah.
In a week as well.
So thank you.
Well done.
I've done it.
I've done it.
Yeah.
It's, it's, it looks great.
Just like I said, this is totally spot on.
We're looking for.
I'm seeing.
Caroline.
I have to go back and correct.
I didn't weigh it was 0.35.
It's way.
It was 0.4.
these uh the sum category again by changing it to 0.35. Yeah I think so yeah sorry that's my mistake
I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't or I just have to change whatever is written
0.04 to 0.35 and then just take everything together this shouldn't take long. And it's only category
13 so it's yeah it shouldn't be it shouldn't be too bad. It will impact the sum category. Yeah that's
right category 13 in the sum that's right that's all excellent great good good good I still can't
find the email do you mind sharing your screen Caroline or or Celine or somebody to well I
might get more coffee sorry okay um
see if I can
share my screen
thanks
yeah we can see it can you see it yeah number seven okay um
um papers right good so we've talked about the papers and and thank you for the rds paper as well
I will read that that's cool right so I started playing around so one so the uh the trimming so um
yeah so uh boy how do I start I start by drinking more coffee um okay on on point one
there's there's something sneaky we can do there's a bit of a cheat so um
um so so in rds the usually what's done is your your sampling from the hidden population but
with convenience and snowball and all this jazz but everybody in your sample is is
is in the hidden population and the objective is to calculate the size it's a size estimation
so our setting is a little different but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of
tools in the rds toolkit and one of them is and I don't know why they they came up with this
because but it's per it's great for us is um is a proportion estimate so you could say okay here's
this here's this hidden populate so we're in the classical rds world which says everyone is in a
hidden population and you want to know something about uh covariate so for example um you want to
know the hiv status among iv drug users so iv drug users is your hidden population you can do an
rds but you want to know you want a proportion that are hiv positive say so the point is there's
some dichotomous variable that you can sample so for us it's are you exposed so here's take one take
one is there's some indicator or there's 12 indicators whatever um and we so what i'm trying
to say is is the the if we consider our popular hidden population to be the set of domestic workers
in the uk with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being have you zero one have are you
experiencing modern slavery yes or no again all the operationalization issues aside not with standing
but there's a way then off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in
our frame that have have this trait that are experiencing ms so why is that sneaky that sneak
so that's straightforward we can do but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number
it tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame that we think are experiencing this
so it's it's it's kind of a clever statistical trick where where in my opinion of statisticians
is that they take questions that you actually want to know the answer to and turn them into
questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're
interested in and i think i think this kind of fits in that category so um so i take it as good
news though like i said i mean one other sneaky thing we could do which is is different from us
than the rds world is we we have x we have based on other sources we have estimates i think of
like for example the size of domestic workers in the uk i think if so then we can do i mean
estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear but if so then we could i'm trying to say we could we could
we could we could force a number if we if we wanted to we can get a proportion using very
straightforward very proper methods if we have an estimate for the size of domestic workers in
the uk with a cell phone then we can we can we can gin up a size estimate so that's pretty cool i
think so that's that's that's one thing and that requires like i mean i could do that this afternoon
that get well yeah i could do that this afternoon requires very very little little little work i
mean like i said uncertainty estimates is going to be a bear but we'll have to figure that that
that's that now the risk uh actually i progressed since i wrote this email um so really i've been
describing it is there's there's like a zero one your your your hib positive where you're not but
turns out the the same methods actually apply for continuous variables so we can do exactly the same
thing with the risk uh uh uh index now here the news is not as good and a little bit treacherous um
so i was thinking about this what what's the quantity of interest here because so normally we
were we're going to know the size of section such but with the risk index is that we don't i don't
think and correct me if i'm wrong we don't care about like the total we don't want a number we don't
want like the sum of everyone's risk indices i don't think i think instead what we want is a
distribution we want to know in the population how is this risk distributed are there lots of
people with high value you know etc etc etc so that that would be ideally what we'd want
and i'm not aware of rds methods that will do that they'll give us numbers and confidence intervals
um so that's not great now here's the treacherous bit is um lots of these you're gonna hate me
so lots of these rds methods that have been playing with our our our Bayesian methods does that
mean anything anybody if not no problem not much i heard the term but i don't know that i
understand what it means absolutely no problem so so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the
statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistics so the idea there is you get
an estimate and you get a standard error or confidence interval or whatever you can do hypothesis
testing great go there's a whole other way of doing statistics called Bayesian in which um
um the Bayesians say um well so let me put it differently so in the frequencies world there is
truth there is some true size of this hidden population we just don't know it and our goal
is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great the Bayesians say
no there's no such thing as truth doesn't exist there's only belief and data and i the good
reverend bayes can tell you how you should adjust your beliefs in the presence of data okay so why
do i why am i prattling on about this i'm prattling on about this because in the Bayesian world what
you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing what you get out
is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions so what you get
out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval it's a shape it's a it's a
posterior distribution of the quantity of interest so in the in our world it would be not a size of
the hidden population it would be a distribution of how hard of our beliefs about the size of
of the hidden population does that make sense i'm thinking about it okay it's really weird i mean
it's a very they're two very very different ways of thinking about uh the world and learning from
data basically is it a sort of variability graph is that what you would produce what you would produce
is is a distribution saying for each value how likely how how confident are we the analyst
that the the size of the hidden population is 8500 there's some there's some belief there's some
probability that we have that the the size of the hidden population is 8500 people and there's some
belief or some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people that's some other
number and so on and so forth for every for everything okay so so why is it somewhat treacherous
this is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out a distribution when these rds
methods don't really produce distributions so the the treacherous bit is we if we use these Bayesian
methods to this rds risk thing what we would get out is a distribution but not a distribution
but not a distribution for the not not a distribution of the risk indices but a
distribution for our beliefs about the total the the sum of the risk indices
so that's what i'm saying it's a little treacherous like we it's a bit like before
we could force a distribution but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested
in it's like it's it's kind of like the difference between a distribution a sample distribution like
so you've got a bunch of x's and you can plot those or you could plot a sample means so take a
bunch of samples calculate a mean for each one and plot those so those are two distributions but
they're different they're not they're not and they both come from the variable x but they're
definitely not the same thing um and so so that's that's what i'm proposing is sort of a
it's like that it's very similar to the difference between that i just described um
so again i don't know if that's useful or not um i was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't
a there's one more paper i need to read to before i ruled out the but but i mean i think
i mean i think i i think i see what we need and and i don't i'm not aware of methods that
that do that because we want essentially we want we want a different feature of the network than
features of the network that people usually study right people usually study things like
maybe degree distribution but almost always yeah prevalence size what have you and we that's fine
but we want other features of of the network like uh the distribution of this continuous
covariate across across the network it's sort of like a one step removed like the mean is a
as a measure of the sample population exactly then the belief is a measure of confidence
i'm not really expressing it very well you got it exactly right you got it exactly right you got
exactly right and and so that's what exactly exactly and that's why it's treacherous because
we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want
but it kind of uses the variables whose distribution we do want to come up with this thing so
i don't really know it's like i said it's it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics and at the end
of the day i don't know how useful that would be but um let me write that down i do need one
there's one other paper i need to check um let's bear with me in that work distribution
and please correct me if i'm wrong if you if you either you know anything about uh
you know caroline last week he corrected me when i was and that was wonderful or two weeks ago
whatever it was but that was great so so uh hopefully um so anyway so so so point two is
kind of a mix i guess i don't really don't really know what to make of point two um and i don't
remember what i put it down as a possibility i think edward de bono has this idea of po doesn't
hear you and to me this seems like a po what's po po it's a it's a well i think about it as a
possibility it could be this could be possible but we we're sort of holding it up as a um a
possibility rather than a definite something that we know we can do so it's an opportunity
to engage in this pleasing discussion oh i see i see i understand i'm sorry i see yeah that's right
that's right um i don't remember what point three was if there was a point three i don't
i'm sorry i don't remember let me see if i can scroll down a bit further for you i'm hoping
that you can see my screen oh yeah it's perfect it's absolutely fine yeah thank you uh off the shelf
yeah um yeah there's there's software out there i've been playing with it again i've made some
i've made more progress since i wrote this uh email but they're yeah they keep
laptop yeah i keep crashing so i've had to switch a bit but i'm making some progress on that which is
which is um which is good oh right and then four right right so then so i'm i'm i'm i mean i think
we're solid on points uh one one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great but
then you know there's a sense in which this is all we've sort of strayed in a sense and this is not
a criticism of anybody this is not a criticism of anybody's data anybody's data gathering strategy
no no no no no sorry oh that was great yeah lovely friday apologies for that um um we we sort of
strayed in the following sense but we at least when i started working with you all which again is
awesome um we're working from the within the in some literature and trying to use g-sum and and
fian and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right it's just we're not the
techniques that we're describing here don't don't don't scale anything up um and that's kind of
unfortunate because we have all this we have this cool data and you know we have the possible
we could do scale up it's just we don't have this representative sample and that's so we're
worried about that um and it's especially bad because the those so normally uh non-random
sampling sort of how do i say this the usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty
estimates but but here that's not the case the the the the sampling uh the selection mechanism
affects not only the uncertainty estimates but actually the raw counts as well which kind of
makes sense because if you are picking people for who are if you're picking people who scale up to
bigger numbers and other people then okay that sort of makes sense that your your your your your
estimate of the count is going to be is going to be off okay right so what so what so i was thinking
like well okay we can do one two and three but we're sort of we're leaving yeah we've we've
straight from the flock from the we've straight from the initial and we're sort of we're leaving a lot
of juicy information on the table so is there is there any way that we can that we can do this and
this is where i had to start writing things down because i knew for a fact i would not at all remember
how to choose this but i i i think there's a way that um i i think we can i so sorry so what i'm
trying to say is um i think we can combine the two so i and i think i see how um again uncertainty
is going to be a real bear but the idea is basically you use the ideas from rds to to to
use the ideas of rds when doing the scale up to account for the non-random selection
and i tried to write down the details at least enough that would remind me of of where to go
in the in the future but it's it's it's basically taking equations from the
guile article and the fian and and sol sol and sort of gluing them together
and and praying so again sounds absolutely fantastic and we'll see um but yeah i think
i think it's worth trying circle in a way because this is what we were hoping that we would start
off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going no it won't work because this won't work because
this won't and now possibly there's a glimmer yep and i mean another nice i i think it's a
nice thing that you all might disagree is that what i'm proposing here is we'll get you know
oodles of estimates which i think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see
if is their consistency is their not is there because we will have all these different methods
you know to to throw at this problem and personally i think that's a i think it's informative
either way if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates that's
reassuring in a certain sense and if they don't that's informative that's telling you something
about about this so i think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without
detractors but i'm i'm i'm i think i think that's on balance i think that's good news so
that's my report which isn't really really exciting so that's fantastic if we think that
that we might be able to circle back to reinstate new sim using summer fian and to sell
yeah that's great that's that's the idea that's the idea yeah i mean i i yeah let me say i'll
try it out the um i'll try it out i'll try it out yeah um and i suppose our our ground our
foundation is that we can use the rds methods to get an estimator so estimator so even if this
yeah more advanced work doesn't reveal what we wanted to we've got a yeah when we're talking
about originally about that what we really wanted was some sort of estimate for this
and we feel that we can now achieve that yeah again with with the caveat which is
i don't know if it's good or bad but it's an important caveat that the thing that we're
estimating is a proportion and not a count yeah um yeah with that with that caveat we're solid
we're very very solid brilliant now i was reading a paper which was talking about this
difference between proportion and counts so um we can include that in the write up um and yeah
that's that's great i mean this i'm going to ask a really stupid question now but if we have a
proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size can we not produce a scale up
exactly we so that's right it's exactly so that we absolutely can't say what if we like if we
want a number we can produce a number um there's two here's a pro here's a con the pro is we're
bringing in outside information which i'm generally a fan of because you know one sample i mean
again there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better so if
there's other sources of of of data that we can incorporate that's great uh there's the pro the
con is um reflecting uncertainty in that world i'll have to think about um because
unless we had like a census count of domestic workers in the uk which i don't think we do then
then there's uncertainty in that estimate and i it's not immediately obvious to me how to combine
those two sources of uncertainty it's got to be possible i just have to sit down i'll have to
have another cup of coffee but yeah exactly if you if we if we if we want a number we can get a number
now we just be yeah it wouldn't be that
confidence is something yeah it would be tough to yeah it'll just be and we could just report that
i mean we could just say look here's here's the here's the estimate um there's two sources of
uncertainty we can't account for the one source of uncertainty and we can for the other and here's
it would just be a front of it and say you know or even more straightforward here's our point
estimate and because of data constraints we can't produce an uncertainty estimate sorry so like take
it or leave it you know um yeah yeah okay but the and you tell me caroline and from like a policy
perspective or impact perspective is i would think that a proportion would be i mean i know like
at least what i hear from people like cod and and what i understand from my home office is that
at the government level they they do want numbers they want counts but it i would think that a
proportion would be of abuse question mark yes i think so yeah definitely it's more than we've
got at the moment at the moment we've just got descriptive statistics so to have a proportion
is a real step forward that's great i can i will yeah i will get another couple i will do that this
afternoon uh that would be fantastic yeah that's really really good do you need anything more from
us scott yeah at this stage uh can you write my lecture slides for for next week please that's
the number one thing i need uh uh um seriously but that's uh no no well saline please just just
share when you get the category 13 thing fixed up which is i'm not worried about it's
trivial um just send it around again and i'll um i will do it after the meeting that's great that's
great and and shouldn't take long no it shouldn't and um i will uh yeah i'll do the i'll do the
proportion stuff this afternoon at least i'll i'll i'll try to and see uh see what comes out uh
and then i'm afraid i'm gonna have to park it again because teaching is gonna be horrible yeah
but i think we've really made some good progress here and i've got i've been looking forward in
my diary and i've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft up they i've been
making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using so i want to
consolidate that into a draft and i can share that with you that's a great idea so that'll be
a couple of weeks time i'm afraid but oh no no no that's no rush no rush on my end
time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way i think
we're in a position where we can start to do that i hope i'm not being overly optimistic but i think
i think it's very exciting i think it's quite promising really if i i mean i don't know this
literature as well as you all do but but it seems like there's a possibility to make a real contribution
i think um which is exciting so thanks for the opportunity it's good yeah very cool yeah really
good right well given that you've got lectures right i'm not proposing to detain you and yeah
any longer any longer than we have to and slim was there anything else from your side
that we needed to cover today uh this i mean there's just the category 13 yeah that i yeah
i'm sorry about that so i have to make a different mistake i have also more attention so i will just
dean up the category 13 and then uh recalculate the sound category and then share this
as opposed to you haven't yeah is there anything else that i can help with dr moulton let me i'm
just looking at the um right no as long as i've got the the node one the node two that that's
important no it looks like the uh what's weather exploitation you've mentioned in the email i'm
sorry whether that because we want to exclude respondents that have not been excluded exploited
oh this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some form of reverie okay thank you thank
you so they are all exploited gotcha something right which yeah and you got the waves and you got
the no yep nope oh well there is one other thing i think we've already covered it and that is what are
the if i'm gonna do that yeah there is one very important thing i think thank you for thank you
for that caroline um it doesn't have to be a single question in fact i think like a set would be great
which if i wanted to dichotomize and say yes you're in experiencing minor slavery no you're not
what questions plural would i what question should i use and and if there's one of the
one question that's fine which set of questions should i use there's the one like the n r m seems
like a pretty gold standard yeah that's good so the gut and the forced labor ones as well
are more indicative of forced uh of one slavery it's that last the point one one which is
elit potentially illegal exploitation but not necessarily labor not necessarily modern slavery
so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator they could be exploited it's labor
exploitation but it isn't it isn't modern slavery okay and that's q 36 5 b 1 uh and so i should use
that one and the n r m question mark yeah the n r m is definitely well as definitely as you can be
yeah yeah within our data modern slavery but combined with the forced labor increases the
confidence yeah good point and the two times to uh get anything else any other questions you think
i should be using for this indicator variable not that i don't think i've still aim if you've got
any anything you want to mention anything i'm looking at the document i i don't think so okay
great mix my life thank you that's great super duper okay thanks as up thanks uh as always everyone
yeah brilliant do you want to meet next week or give it a when do you want to catch up again
someone's at my door give me a second i'm so sorry yeah are you around next right
isn't it uh i for the next two weeks until the 22nd i might be not
rainbow because my annual review is coming up okay and i'm in the process of putting everything
together right okay now that's fine so it might be as well to have well if scott can circulate what he
does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again uh probably at the beginning
of december when is your annual review on the 28th 28th so the beginning of December 29 or 29th
of November any day after that right okay first of December since it's a Friday is that a Friday
yeah yeah let me find my calendar too sorry about that fire alarm business um
oh okay so we're suggesting scott perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work
this afternoon but then we don't actually meet again until the first of december that works
just if you don't mind sending me a team so invite that would be that would be great yeah
and 12 o'clock is that still a good time yeah i'm flexible so whatever if another time works
better for you all that's that's fine for me uh well 12 is all right for me what about you saloon
11 or 12 this time okay let's go for 11 and i'll circulate an invite and before that date i'll
circulate a draft so probably the week before whatever stage it's in i'll circulate it and then
that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well
great sounds great thanks everyone right good good to speak to you and you all have a nice
weekend yeah me too talk to you later have a good weekend and you thank you bye

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

And I came on last Saturday, OK. Hello, docomo. 

Speaker 3 

Hello, good afternoon everybody. How are you? 

Speaker 2 

Not. Hi, good to see you. 

Speaker 3 

And you. 

Speaker 2 

I would. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, go ahead, please. Caroline, I'm not prepared. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I was gonna say thank you for your e-mail. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking. It's just a way of trying to keep an aide memoir, isn't it? Of of where we're up to with this, really. So it's really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought. 

Speaker 

So. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. 

Speaker 2 

We might, we might have a path forward. From what you're saying. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, honestly. 

Speaker 2 

That sounds really good. 

Speaker 3 

I. I had to write everything down cause I knew I'd forget in the interim, and sure enough I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that e-mail. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No. And I keep talking while you're looking for it. So interestingly, the Nook paper that you mentioned in it, I think that there that is the first of two studies that they've done and we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I showed with you was the second study. 

Speaker 3 

Please. Thank you. OK. 

Speaker 

Ah. 

Speaker 2 

They should have done a cohorts study. And so now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional that we've managed to track down both. Reports small world, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

But. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think we know what we're where they're where they're publishing anyway and so that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the the guile. Is it guile? You pronounce her surname. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But I will read that and that will be useful for just putting the literature review related to RDS together. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. And then. 

Speaker 2 

Selim has done a fantastic job of thinking actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started. So I think we've made some, some pretty good progress this week. So I, I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings. So that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the e-mail, Scott? 

Speaker 

Good. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Would you want to chat with them? Chat about the risk assessment and everything? 

Speaker 3 

Still can't find it. Yeah, if you don't mind. Please do. I'm so sorry. I. Yeah, so sorry. Please. Please. 

Speaker 2 

Now we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then, right. So what I tried to do, slim as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right. But. There are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally, and Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning a weight so that overall they would add up to 1. So we had effectively an index of of. No exploitation through to in every form of exploitation we could think of. And and we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there might be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process. But from what you're saying in your e-mail system, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. So I have, I have gone through gone through these steps that you have sent me in your e-mail last Friday and they all 97 people. You know, so you have some level of exploitation and. If you go to the. Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night. You can see when you go to. The column some categories so you can see that 0.3660.20.1 and that continues so and as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13. Categories that we have asked our respondents. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So the question that I had and forgive me if I. Misunderstood this, but we when we put the the measures together, there was some that were sort of composite measures. So there, there would be thirteen sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement where there were two or three together. So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding slim or have you just? Done a a. Sort of. All or nothing coding. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it all on nothing coding, so is this the? I mean I didn't. I can't. Last week the the meeting that you had, it is it's just a complication then. 

Speaker 2 

Well, this is I. I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this we've got. I mean definitely you've answered the first question was that how many people in this sample we experienced any form of exploitation and we know. Because of the way we've selected organizations. To approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation and not just generic. People working in the sector. So that I think. Is good for our the clarity of our method. And and I suppose the question is, could we or do we want to do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got, because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've. Design the measures is it is just purely a cumulative sum. But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub. Totals almost. I suppose that's a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run. 

Speaker 3 

Little, I'm sorry. 

Speaker 2 

How how are you? No. How you how you sort of conceptualize the risk index? 

Speaker 3 

First cup of coffee, so apologies to all but I'm not exactly so I I see there's what 13 categories. Is that right? Some number of categories? Yeah, 13 categories and celines for each person. Celine indicated the extent to which they. Fit in that category and the categories in the Word document are. Oh, I see the the categories aren't individual questions, they're. Compilations of questions. Is that correct? 

Speaker 2 

In some cases. 

Speaker 3 

In some cases. 

Speaker 2 

It's not always we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And then? So so sorry. Give me a second. So so, so lean. How did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet? 

Speaker 1 

So Caroline sent me the e-mail. I I think you have been also including the same e-mail so. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I think I'm just sharing it this slit communication. Can you see? That, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's exactly what I have. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. So I. So going back to the question. Let's start here. For example, this would be category one, yeah? Yeah. Category one and we have our question. And for that question, we have more answers in this survey. We don't have only yes, always, often or sometimes. There's also no. But and and so on so, but as long as they answer one of these. Responses they have been forced to do work against their will and back. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

To the question. And that will be done. Weighted with 0.25. Yeah, and. 

Speaker 3 

What do you mean weighted by 0.2? So it's like 0.25 times. 

Speaker 1 

0.0250.02. 

Speaker 3 

2. 

Speaker 2 

Five. So that's the proportion of the total index of 1. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk so that there was a sort of cumulative effect. So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding silly correctly when you. Look at this category. One silly that was designed to be those two questions together. Yeah. Can you see because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability? Yeah. So. That would give you a composite weighting. So if you answered the first question and in any of those responses you get point nought, 25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further point. Nought, 25, do you use the maximum? 

Speaker 1 

And this makes 0.05. Yeah, yeah, this is what I have done. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's super. So. 

Speaker 1 

As Caroline said, you have your two questions and. If the respondent our ID, our respondent has. Responded for. Responded for both of these questions. Then they will get a waiting for each 0.025 sum this would be. For this question 0.05 and that continues. So for all questions. So for here for example would be again 0.05. Here we have again. Two questions. So it will be 0.0250.025 if they have been out of that. Indicator for exploitation. Then they will get the weighting of 0.05 and this goes back. Me. At the beginning so. Caroline has let waiting for all our questions in a way that pays 1st 0.35. Zero point. 55. And at the bottom. Is also 0.10 so. In total, this makes then one for 100% so percent. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So that's what I sort of interrupt from our conversation last week, Scott, that's what I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Creatively designed and hoping that I've interpreted it properly. 

Speaker 3 

Gotcha. Thank you. Right. And then yes and then the the I don't want. So hang on. So it's category one category. So I don't want, I don't know how to describe this. So the different. So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't and differs across and. Just to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you you've selected those weights, not .35 for for category 13 and you've done that on qualitatively done on the basis of. 

Speaker 2 

I have some. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

The extent to which. You. You. 

Speaker 2 

Which indicates exploitation, serious exploitation, so that we've got that the middle block that Celine's got on the screen where and those are all indications of forced labour risk. And there's a sort of cumulative effect. So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk. 

Speaker 3 

Right it it. 

Speaker 1 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 3 

Uh-huh. 

Speaker 2 

And so I've had allowed there were about eleven of those indicators. So it just made sense sort of mathematic arithmetically to to get a total of .55 those. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks for waiting, waiting. I think it's it. 

Speaker 2 

By assigning this these smaller weights to each composite measure, then in addition to. That we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is more objective measure of exploitation because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that, that person is experiencing expectation. So we've only got one question on that. 

Speaker 1 

M. 

Speaker 2 

It's actually that's a stronger indicator because it a flight, it's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that .35 on its own. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing explain. One which is this A which is at .1. So this is payment below the national living wage. So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be. It could be a exploitation, but it isn't always right. So that's why I've waited it at a lower level so I could make a a narrative argument for why I've I've put those weightings in, but there's some convenience in making sure that they all add up to one, but there is some sort of a logic behind it. 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. Yeah. No, that makes. Yeah, that's great. So then just a few more follow up questions if I can. So the the. So category 12 is this is like you're saying, is like the suggestive. But not definitive indicator, but it gets a weight of not .1. Which is twice the weight of say category 11. 

Speaker 2 

It is. 

Speaker 3 

Right. So. Why that confuses me is is if it's if if if if category the 12 is the. Loosest, wouldn't we? Down weight it relative to the other categories. 

Speaker 2 

And with the other indicator, it can be illegal. I suppose that this this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially an illegal exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. OK, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Whereas excessive overtime. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

It's not necessarily illegal, I I agree, it's arguable. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

No, no. But I just, it's fine. It's fine. I just want to. Make sure I'm understanding all the all the the. The not point fives and and sorry not point, not fives. Excuse me? And so so all the category. No, that's not true. All the categories in the middle block get not point not 5. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So there are 11 indicators of force labor and for each indicator, it's nought point nought, 5. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's where the not .55 comes from is because you're OK, good. Just one other question then in category 13. And. It's it's weighted, it's stated it's weighted at not .35, but it's also stated it's weighted at. Not .4. 

Speaker 2 

No, it is, isn't it? That's true. So one. 

Speaker 3 

Which? 

Speaker 2 

Of those is. Wrong. So then which one did you use? Did you use the .35? 

Speaker 1 

I've done that with 0.3. 

Speaker 2 

Five. Yeah. So that's that's in typo. 

Speaker 3 

OK, that's fine. That's fine. That's no problem. That's no problem. That's great. OK. No, no. So thank you. So now I understand this. So. 

Speaker 2 

My bad, OK. 

Speaker 3 

So now I'm able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is, if I'm understanding it, do you do you want to combine categories? Is that what you're so? For example, we have? No, I said. Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

I think kilian's done it. I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these 13 categories. I'm right, aren't I? Celine? You have done it that way. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

You can mind the questions the yeah, which is. 

Speaker 2 

The indicators into third question. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. And we're, I'm I'm totally comfortable. With that is that. Do we need any other aggregation? 

Speaker 1 

Some some category. Sorry. I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one the same category? 

Speaker 2 

Now I'm happy with exactly I'm I'm happy with what you've done. I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures, but we do. So that's perfect. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK, I'm. I'm I'm happy with that. If if you all are, I think that's I think that's great. Good, good. So and then for each of these we get, there's some distribution of this risk, which is great, no problem. Good. Good. And there's no there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level is is there so. So for example combined categories, that's what I understood your question to be, Caroline. But now I say I I'm mistaken, that's not what you were saying. So sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ah, OK. You mean if there was? Evidence of low payment and forced labour and NRN. I mean we've got that in the summation, haven't we? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just you would just if you wanted higher levels of validation you would just add up those categories on their own. Yep, Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good. Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it, so that's great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. In a week as well. So thank you, Celine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, well done. Well done. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it yesterday. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's it's it looks great. It's like. I said this. Is totally spot on. We're we're looking for. 

Speaker 1 

What I'm seeing, Carla, I have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. Its weight was 0.4, so I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.35. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Sorry, that's that's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't and obviously. 

Speaker 1 

I I'm saying so. Probably try. I just have. To change whatever is written 0.040.35. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then just. Take everything together. This shouldn't take long, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And it's only category 13, so it's it's. Yeah, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't. Be too bad. 

Speaker 1 

It will impact some category but it. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's right, category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great, good, good. I still can't find the e-mail. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to? I get more coffee, sorry. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 2 

See if I can. And my screen. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we can't see it. 

Speaker 2 

All right. Can you see? It, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

N7 OK, papers right. Good. 

Speaker 2 

So we talked about the papers and and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that. 

Speaker 3 

That's. That's cool, right? So I started playing around so one so the the trimming so. Yeah. So uh boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee. OK, on on .1. There's there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So uhm. So. So in RDS the usually what's done is you're you're sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz. But everybody and your sample is is. Is in the in population and the objective is to calculate the size. Is the size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit and one of them is. This, and I don't know why they came up with this because but it's it's great for us is is a proportion estimate. So you could say, OK, here's this here's this hidden populate. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population and you want to know something about covariant. So for example you wanna know the HIV status among. IV drug users. So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you wanna know you wanna know proportion that are HIV positive say so. The point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us it's are you exposed so to to take one take one is there's some indicator. Where there's 12 indicators, whatever. And we So what I'm trying to say is is the. If we consider our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being, have you 01 have? Are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside notwithstanding, but there's a way then. Off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have this trait that are experiencing mass. So why is that sneaky that sneaky? So that's straightforward. We can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame. That we think are experiencing this. So it's kind of clever statistical trick where it might my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually know the. Answer to and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in, and I think this kind of fits in that category. So, so I take it as good news though, like I said, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is different from us than the RDS world is we. We have ex. We have based on other sources, we have estimates I think. Of like for example the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think if so then we can do I mean estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear. But if so then we could. I'm trying to say is we could we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of. Domestic workers in the UK with the cell phone. Then we can we can. We can gin up a size estimate, so that's pretty cool. I think so. That's that's one thing. And that requires, like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon. Well, yeah, I could do that. This. Afternoon requires very little. Little. Little little work. I mean, like I said, uncertainty estimates is going to be a bare, but we'll have to figure out that now the risk actually progress since I wrote this e-mail. So really I've been describing it is there's there's like a 01 your, your your HIV positive or you're not. But it turns out that the same methods actually applies for continuous variables. So we can do exactly the same thing with the Risk Index now. Here the news is. Not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what's the quantity of interest here? Because so normally we were what we want to know the size of section size, but with the risk index, we don't, I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, we don't. Care about like the total. We don't want a number. We don't want, like the sum of everyone's risk indices. I don't think I think. Instead what we want is the distribution. We want to know in the population. How is this risk distributed? Are there lots of people if I value, etc. Etcetera. So that would be ideally what we'd want and I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that. They'll give us numbers and confidence intervals. So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is. Lots of these. You're gonna hate me. So lots of these RDS methods that I've been playing. With our our. Our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything to anybody if? Not no problem. Bayesian so. 

Speaker 2 

Not much. I heard the term, but I don't know that. 

Speaker 3 

I am absolutely no problem. So so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistic. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or conference interval or whatever you can do hypothesis testing. Great go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics like Bayesian in which. Bayesian, say. Well, so let me put it in. So in the frequentist world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population. We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great. The bayesians say no, there's no such thing as truth. Doesn't exist. There's only belief and data, and I the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should. Adjust your beliefs in the presence of data. OK, so why do I what am I addling on about this? I'm adding on about this because in the Bayesian world what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing. What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval. It's a shape. It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in in our world it would be not a size of the hidden population, it would be a distribution of how. Of our beliefs about the size of the hidden population. That makes sense. 

Speaker 2 

I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. 

Speaker 3 

OK. It's it's really weird. I mean it's a very there are two very, very different ways of thinking about. The world and learning from data, basically. 

Speaker 2 

So is it a sort of a variability graph? Is that what you would produce? 

Speaker 3 

What you would produce is is a distribution saying for each value, how likely. How confident are we the analyst. That the the size of the hidden population is 8500. There's some. There's some belief there's some probability that we have that the the size of hidden population is 8500 people, and there's some belief there's some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every for everything. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out of distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions, so the tractor split is we. If we use these Bayesian method. Leads to this RDS risk thing. What we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the not a distribution of the risk indices, but a distribution for our beliefs about the total. The sum of the risk indices. So it's saying a little treacherous, like it's a bit like before. We could force a distribution, but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in. It's like the it's kind of like the difference between a sample distribution. So you've got a bunch of X's and you can plot those or you could plot sample means. So take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two different distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not. And they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing. And so that's that's what I'm proposing is sort of. 

Speaker 2 

Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Is like. That is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not. I was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a there's one more paper I need to read to before I ruled out the the. But but I mean, I think it's, I mean I think I think I see what we need and and I don't I'm not aware of methods that that do that. We want essentially we want, we want a different feature of the network than features of the network that people usually study, right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always, yeah. Prevalence size, what have you and that's fine. But we want other features of the network like. The distribution of this continuous covariant across across the network. 

Speaker 2 

It's sort of like a one step removed, like the mean is as as a measure of the. Some or population. Then the belief is a measure of confidence and I'm not really expressing. 

Speaker 3 

Is that the? 

Speaker 2 

It very well. 

Speaker 3 

No, no, you got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. And so that's exactly exactly that's why it's treacherous. Cause we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses. The variables whose distribution we do want to come up with this thing so. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I don't really know. Like I said, it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics. And at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one. There's one other paper I need to check. Bear with me in network distribution. And please correct me if I'm wrong. If either you know anything about, you know Caroline, last week he corrected me when it was. And that was wonderful. Or two weeks ago, whatever it was. But that was great. So. So hopefully I'm. So anyway, so so so .2 is kind of a mix I guess. I don't really. I don't really know what to make of. .2 and I don't remember what point. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward de Bono has this idea of Poe, doesn't he? And to me, this seems like a Poe. Like Poe. It's a it's a. 

Speaker 3 

Wait, what's the code? 

Speaker 2 

Well, I I think about it as a a possibility. It could be it could be possible, but we we're sort of holding it up as a. A possibility rather than a definite something that we. Know we can do. So it's an opportunity to engage in this Bayesian discussion. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh I see, I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't remember. What .3 was, if there was a .3? I don't. Sorry, I don't remember. 

Speaker 2 

Let me see if I can Scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see my screen properly. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you. Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it again. I've made some. I've made more progress since I wrote this e-mail, but they're yeah, they keep. One of my laptop keeps crash. Yeah, keeps crashing. So I've I've had to switch a bit, but I'm I'm making some progress on that which is which is, which is good, right? And then four. Right, right. So then. 

Speaker 2 

I think. 

Speaker 3 

So I'm I'm I'm I'm. I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great. But then there's a sense in which this is we sort of strayed in a sense and this is not a criticism of anybody. This is not a. Criticism. Of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no. 

Speaker 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh that was great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, lovely. Friday. Apologies for that. We we sort. Of strayed in in the following sense, at least when I. Started working with you all, which again is awesome. We're working from. Within the in some literature and trying to use Gsom and Feehan and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right. The techniques that we're describing here don't scale anything up. And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data and we have the. We could do scale up. It's just we don't have this representative sample and that. So we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the so normally. Non random sampling sort of. How do I say this? The usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But but here that's not the case. The the the, the, the. Sampling. The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates, but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people. Or who? If you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers than other people, then OK, that sort of makes sense that your your your estimate of the count is gonna be is gonna be OK. Right. So what? So what? So I was thinking like, well, OK, we can do 1/2. And three, but we're sort. Of we're leaving. Yeah, we've, we've, we've straight from the flock. From the we're straight from the initial. And we're sort. Of we're leaving a lot of juicy information on the table, so is there. Is there any way that we can do this? And this is where. I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this, but I think there's a way that. I I think we can. So sorry. What I'm trying to say is. I think we can combine the two, so I and I think I see how. Again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear, but the idea is. Basically you use the ideas from RDS to. Use the ideas of RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection. And I tried to write down the details at least enough that would remind me of of of where to go in the future. But it's it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the. And and saw and sort of gluing them together and praying so again. 

Speaker 2 

For anyone else. That sounds absolutely fantastic and yeah. 

Speaker 3 

We'll see. But yeah, I think it's, I think it's worth trying. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, we sort of come full circle in a way. This is what we were hoping that we would try. We'd start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because this won't work because this won't be and now possibly. Yeah. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I mean another nice I I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree. Is that what I'm proposing here is we'll get oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because. You can sort. Of look across them and see is there consistency is there not is there. You have all these different methods to throw at this problem and. Personally, I think that's a I think it's informative either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates, that's reassuring in a certain sense. And if they don't, that's informative. That's telling you something about it about this. So I think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without detractors. But I'm. I'm. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I'm a I think I think that's. On balance, I think that's good news. So that's my report, which isn't. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really, really exciting. So that that's fantastic. If we think that that we might be able to circle back to real estate, Newsome using some of the and then to sell great. Yeah, that's great. 

Speaker 3 

That's that's the idea. That's the idea. I mean. Yeah, let's say I'll try it out the I'll try it out. I'll. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Try it out, yeah. And I suppose our. Our ground, our foundation, is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so. 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

Even if this yeah, more advanced work. Doesn't reveal what we want it to. We've got a when we're talking about originally about the what we really wanted was some sort of estimate of this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Again with with the caveat which. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it's an important caveat that the thing we're estimating is a proportion or not a count. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

But yeah, with that, with that caveat, we're we're solid. We're very, very solid. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Now I I was reading a paper which which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up. And and yeah, that's. That's great. I mean this. I'm gonna ask a really stupid question now. 

Speaker 3 

Nope. 

Speaker 2 

But if we have a proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size, can we not produce a scale up? 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. So that's right. Exactly. So we absolutely can we like if we if we want a number we can produce a number, there's two. Here's a pro. Here's a con. The Pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of. Cuz 1 sample. I mean again, there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better. So if there's other sources of data that we can incorporate, that's great. That's the pro the con is. Reflecting uncertainty in that world. I'll have to think about because. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Unless we had, like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 3 

Then there's uncertainty in that estimate, and I it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty. It's gotta be possible. I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee. But yeah, exactly. If if we if we want a number, we can get a number. 

Speaker 2 

No. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Now. 

Speaker 2 

We just be. Yeah, it wouldn't be that. 

Speaker 3 

Confidence is something. Yeah. It would be tough to it. It would just be and we could just report that. I mean, we could just say, look, here's here's the estimate. There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty. And we can't for the other. 

Speaker 2 

It could be that confidence in that number. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And here's it would just be upfront about it and say or even more straightforward. Here's our point estimate. And because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry. So take it or leave it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. But the and you tell me, Caroline, from, like, a policy perspective or impact perspective is I would say that a. Proportion would be. I mean, I know like at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from the Home Office is that. At the government level, they they do want numbers they want. Counts but it. I would say that a proportion would be of use question mark or. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so, yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The. Moment. At the moment we've just got descriptive statistics, so to have a proportion is a. Real step forward. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

That's great, I can. I. Will. Yeah, I will get another couple. I will do that this afternoon actually. 

Speaker 2 

That would be fantastic. That. No, that's really, really good. Do you need anything more from us, Scott, at this stage? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Yeah. Can you write my lecture slides for next week, please? That's the number one thing I need. Seriously with this. No. Well, just when you get to category 13 saying fixed up, which is I'm not worried about it. It's trivial. Just send it around again and I'll. 

Speaker 1 

I will. I will do it after the meeting. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. That's great. And and it shouldn't take long. No, it shouldn't. And I will. Yeah, yeah, I'll do the. I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon, at least I'll try to and see what comes out, and then I'm afraid we have to park it again because teaching is gonna be. Horrible. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, but I think we've really made some good progress here and I've got, I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft. Stop the. I've been making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using, so I want to consolidate that into the draft and I can share that with you. So that will be in a couple of weeks time and but I've got some time, but time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. That's a great idea. Oh, no, no, no, that's no rush. No rush on my end, please. 

Speaker 2 

We're in a position where we can start to do that. 

Speaker 3 

I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think. I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really, if I. I mean I I don't know this literature as well as they all do, but but it seems like. There's a possibility to make a real contribution, I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, very. Yeah, that is good. Yeah. Yeah, really good. 

Speaker 1 

Very cool. 

Speaker 2 

Right. Well, given that you've got exercises, I'm not proposing to detain. Yeah, you don't get any longer than we have to and slim with everything else from your side that we needed to cover. Today. 

Speaker 1 

I mean, there's just the categories that I've not done. I have to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that. My deliberate mistake. 

Speaker 1 

I I can also pay more attention to it, so I I will. Clean up the categories 13 and then recalculate the sum category and then share it with. Dispose of you and yeah. Is there anything else that I can help with? Doctor Moser? 

Speaker 3 

Let me I'm just looking at the. Right now, as long as I've got the node one and the node 2, that's important. Now it looks like the what's weather exploitation. You've mentioned a new e-mail type of. 

Speaker 1 

Whether they have been, but whether they have because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited by looking at that. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some fame, right? Right. OK, thank 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. It's that so they are all exploited some degree. 

Speaker 3 

You. Thank you. Got you. Right, which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got. The Yep. Nope. Bye. Ohh well there is one of them. I think we've already covered. It and that is what are the. It it if I'm gonna do that? Yeah, there is one. Very important thing. Thank you for. Thank you for that, Caroline. It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think book is set would be. Great, but which? If I wanted to dichotomize and say yes, you're in experiencing modern slavery. No, you're not. What questions? Plural, would I? What question should I use and and if there's more than one question, that's fine. Which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM. Seems like a pretty gold standard. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's good. So they got and the forced labour ones as well are more indicative of forced of once slavery. It's that last the point. 11 which is it potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labour? Not necessarily modern slavery, so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator, they they could be exploited. It's labour exploitation, but it isn't. It isn't modern slavery. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's Q 36 five B1? And so I should use that one and the NRM. Question mark. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the only one is definitely well, as definitely as you can be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Within our data, modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, good point. And the 2 * 2. Anything else? Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable? 

Speaker 2 

Not that I can think of. Still him. Have you got any anything you want to? Mention anything common? Use. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I I'm looking. At the document I I don't think so. 

Speaker 3 

OK, great. Good. Makes my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. OK. Thanks. Thanks as always everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, brilliant. Do you want to meet next week or give it? When do you want to catch up again? 

Speaker 3 

Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so. Sorry, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Are you around next Friday today? 

Speaker 1 

I for the next two weeks until the 22nd I might be not. Because my annual review is coming up OK, yeah, I'm. I'm in the process of putting everything together. 

Speaker 2 

Right, OK, now that's fine. So it would be as well to have well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again. 

Speaker 

My. 

Speaker 2 

Probably at the beginning of December, when is your annual review. 

Speaker 

I can't. 

Speaker 1 

On the 28. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

The 28th, so the beginning. Of December would be aware. 

Speaker 1 

29 or 29th of November. 

Speaker 2 

Any day off on that one, right. OK. 

Speaker 1 

3rd of December, since it's a Friday, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Is that a Friday again? Yeah. Let me find my calendar too. Fire alarm business. 

Speaker 3 

Sorry about that. Umm. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh OK, so we're suggesting Scott. Perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the 1st of December. 

Speaker 3 

That works just if you don't mind sending me a team invite. That would be that would be great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, and and 12:00, is that still a good time? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I'm flexible, so whatever. If another time works better for you all that's that's fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

That's alright for me. What about you, silly? 

Speaker 1 

11 or 12 is fine. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's go for 11:00. Then I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft. So we've got some probably in the week before whatever stage it's in. I'll circulate it and and then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on. 

Speaker 1 

No. Ohh good. 

Speaker 2 

That as well. Right. 

Speaker 3 

Sounds great. Thanks everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, good. Good to speak to you. Thank you. Getting fire alarm sorted out, OK. 

Speaker 3 

And. All have a nice weekend. Yeah, me too. Talk to you later and you. Thank you. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Have a good weekend. 

 Can you hear me excellent sorry I'm late I thought I slipped my mind at the coffee
shop and then popped up anyway sorry I'm late sorry sorry nice to see you all
how are you staying warm great how are you doing because you were I think you
had a doctor's appointment last week are you okay the health helps better thank
you yeah I'm cold but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it but
it's it's yeah I've been marking hell so how are how are you all yeah I'm doing
all right thank you yes I've been doing a little bit of teaching but just a
skills days for social policy social workers so yeah most of my teaching
takes place next term so I've got I'll be buried well I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm the
opposite so I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but enjoy enjoy while you can I
haven't touched anything since your last talk but if that said it's still
probably a good idea to touch base and see what's next or what's what what where
we are just so we don't sort of get off track thanks a ton for the draft I I
found the the sources and I give it a quick read but I haven't really done
anything I'm sorry yeah buried with teaching and grading so sorry no that's
okay I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it so it is it is a first
draft it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst
they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and
Celine might be able to contribute like sections of text so hopefully I'm not
asking you to put in anything that you're not not I'm able and willing to
contribute no that's of course thank you I missed that though can you what I don't
have it over and what so I mean obviously the the result the methods and
the results but yeah yeah so I've got some methodology down there but there's
obviously you're closer to the detail of what you're doing so yeah methodology and
results that's it and then yeah once we've got that in we can revisit the
discussion I put some points down but there will obviously be more coming out
when we've got the fuller paper to work with the other thing I'm aware that is
outstanding is you'd asked us if they were given the quite high proportion that
we're coming out with whether we could just look at some simple statistics to
see whether that proportion seemed sensible I'm wondering Celine have you
seen that email is that something you might be able to do for us you mean the
article no the Scots last email about taking just doing a sense check against
the proportion figure that he's finding no I didn't I told you just but also for
you Dr. Moses so I had in the last two through weeks my annual review the
preparation submission and also the exam that's why I didn't spend much time with
anything else but it went well so I passed the annual review good and yeah
so just update me quickly Caroline please so I'll forward you the email from
Scott because I've got it and then if you can just take it it's not a big job I
don't think but if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your
findings I mean Scots very kindly indicated which questions it relates to
so it's it's literally a percentage I think isn't it Scott yeah the issue is
just that so we've got these like fancy shmancy techniques which are great and
very preliminarily I and this was weeks ago I I
substance then and I know I had one cup of coffee today so this is all danger but
the sort of where I parked it mentally is we had some initial estimates using
these these sort of next-generation snowball samples for lack of a better
phrase and that is not a very good phrase and doing that gave some really
high at least it seemed to me really high numbers and so I was just thinking
allowed to Caroline and I welcome any and all inputs is just like what if we
don't do fancy shmancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the
proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern
slavery like what is that number I don't know what that number and whatever
that number is it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have a
random sample etc etc etc but just as a something to compare to the I don't
remember the exact numbers Caroline do you remember it was in the thousands
though what wasn't it in the well it was a proportion it was sort of 30% or
something yeah which just sounds really high I mean again it's the proportion
of my group of domestic workers who I think yeah possibly we can say even a
subset of those that are here that are from the Philippines or from Latin
America I think because that we're explicitly sampling that population
but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population yeah so yeah
and so that the percentage just seemed sound high to me but I don't know
anything about this so yeah it's possible yeah because they have no
protection yeah and and that's what I think it is possible I think it but I
think it and I think it would attract interest yeah so it would be good to
be sure as we can about what we're saying this this seems to be quite an
interest there's a lot of interest in this topic when Salim and I publish the
preliminary report just looking at the descriptive statistics we got a lot of
media attention for that so that was not really as exciting as what we're
doing here so I'm sure there would be continued interest from I mean there's
Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today he's sort of following our work and at the
rights lab he always keeps an eye on what press releases we create so he would
I'm sure pick it up again and yeah it is I mean from an impact point of view it's
it's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd
include ours in that but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has
produced a report but it's just descriptive statistics like us so this
really does move the conversation forward but that's great if there's no
say with the change of government if we presumably we get the change of
government then there's a task force which is charged with looking at this
issue within the first hundred days so it's potentially got policy impact so I
think some Andrea Rainer's leading something this that a colleague at
Nottingham Trent mentioned to me so this is the sort of thing that her team
would be interested in picking up as well so it could be really timely this
is bad I really want to be done with grading and get back to this this is
really exciting and that's what I was gonna say is that I wasn't aware of
these what there's word advocacy groups but I wasn't aware of sort of the
specificity that like you mentioned there's like a what was it Latin American
Women's you know and obviously you are connected to that but that's that
would be like you said that would be yeah I mean the more now we're having this
conversation and the once we start sort of sub-setting it down the the
proportion the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this
conversation so that's very exciting if true but okay there's a big caveat and
the big caveat there is so thank you Caroline again for the opportunity and I
completely agree with you that like if we can do some quanti stuff with this
yeah that would be you know the literature way better than I did but
like that's that's a contribution that makes me a little bit anxious because it
makes me think like okay well we really got to get these numbers right then
because you guys look at this isn't you know this isn't something that there's
sort of other it's like there's a pool of of this kind of quanti prevalence
estimation that we can sort of you know oh we're close or we're not so close so
different but here's why like it's pretty new so yeah but I mean yeah I agree and
when Bernard Silverman produced the stats the initial stats for modern
slavery in the UK he used multiple systems estimation to do that and he
produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by
policymakers which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end in that the
situation was far worse than his estimation suggested so I think you're
just talking to you're part of a conversation but the conversation keeps
evolving and the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that
are not correct but that are a way of engaging people in the debate so that's
as long as we're clear about what we've done how we've got to that I think we're
okay I think that's a really great perspective and not one that I had so
it's just a paraphrase you're saying like well I mean I mean essentially like
that's how science works is you you make some estimate you do some research and
then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed
or whatever and I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly
kind of like well gotta make sure this number is you know right for this method
is justified I think you're right that that's sort of not that's a luxury we
don't have in this particular research domain and that's just that's that's
that right that's that's that's not that's not a sin against us that's a nice
perspective I like that that's thank you for that Caroline yeah I mean I think
it's just listening to Bernard talk about his experience and yeah I mean I
think he said that the number of slaves between 11 and 13 thousand and then
later estimates suggested up to 148,000 right I just thought I mean yeah that was
quite a significant change in the number but his paper started that
conversation right and yeah so I think it's just viewing it as this is a
contribution to the debate based on these particular methods so when I get
time when I'm out of marking hell what's the what's the what's the next
step or help reorient me please as to what what I think it's trying to flesh
out that draft so I can go back to it and polish up what I've written and make
sure that it because it's not a bit less stream of consciousness but actually it
needs input from you and Salim as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's the
skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit once you've
had a chance to have a look at it it's got perhaps where you think we might
target it and whether it needs the sort of context setting to appeal to the
audience of the journal that we think we want to go for yeah good so okay thank
you that's helpful and I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my
mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in word and I
think you do understand latex don't you so it might be better actually to write
it in latex which I've never used but perhaps if we can get the draft up to a
certain standard you would be able to then transfer it for us yeah absolutely
that's fine actually and there's there's so back in the day you're right that
fact one of my early collaborators so I use latex and he didn't and we had this
project and he early on he was he was like we're never gonna publish this
because we just we're just gonna clash and so anyway I'm trying to say back in
the day that was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions it's
really straightforward to convert so we can we can still we can still we can
still talk to each other should be should be okay but yeah that's a good
point um Selene do you mind taking a step I don't know what what lit review in
terms of like the methods needs needs or is desired but do you feel comfortable
taking a stab at that so you know the basically I think I've sent along at
this point if you scroll the the the the patrol the trove of emails I've sent I
think there's and Caroline as well a number of papers that that address the
kinds of methods that we're using question mark so I I've written down
for now here the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the
methods section in the art field that Caroline sent and the second task is the
forwarded email so it seems there are some tasks I just had a glance into it
look into the email that Caroline just no forwarded and it asked them for you
Dr. Moseley you're asking for some information from my app so I will look
into that okay and what else is there the method section of the paper I've
already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies Selene so there
there is a method section there and then very sharp right it's okay I mean the
whole paper is 4,000 words currently I don't know quite what with we're
targeting what length we're targeting but I'm asked you specifically if you
could add the network structure graphic you remember that we put that actually
visualizes the structure of the network and and the way the extent to which it's
constructed of different waves okay so that was that section that yeah if you
could put that section in and then I've asked Scott if he could include the
point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated and
then the bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data
analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft because you know what
you've done so those areas are indicated in the paper I'll just put them in
they're indicated at the moment in just normal text I've just put them in bold
so you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier thank you that's great and
then obviously I can polish up the text but I don't want to spend too much time
doing that until results yeah until we know what the over whether it sort of
hangs together as a overall narrative yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I'll thank you
very much Caroline I see it it's it's I see what has to be done and I don't have
time to do it today yeah or what a weekend and also in the beginning of
next week so I'm I'm more free now great excellent is your time table get a bit
better in the new year then Scott is that yeah it gets better until about more I
have one of these intensive things and I plan to work so things will get a lot
better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research fiercely then but yeah for about
not quite a week but essentially the next week I'm yeah anyway it's I mean I see
what has to be done I can't wait to do it and and I'm so sorry but I simply can't
right now no no that's I mean I completely understand the teaching is
and something you can't ignore and and marking is just so many and the oh so
many so many so many yeah yeah I feel your pain well you be I'll sadly or why
don't know for better words so I'll I'll probably work over parts of the break
probably until late December and email and what I'm trying to say is I'll work on this
likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope
you're with your family I must admit my January is not too bad okay so if we can reconvene
perhaps in January does that suit you too Salim I could do online because or even in person
I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week but we could also meet online so
yeah online so would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've
got something to in the diary to work to yeah let's go so what ideally before the 15th of January
maybe yeah agreed would you want to pick it is Friday still going to be good for you Scott
I mean still teaching starts to be honest I don't even know my timetable for next
next term but the yeah Fridays should be should be fine um sort of I go to Salim before the
before the 15th but after the 4th would be good for me I think I'll I think I'll be traveling
until the 4th um uh so I don't know maybe try as the 12th yeah the 12th what's that like
sure yeah and does this time work much great for me a meeting of this time work
yeah it wants to be 11 a.m. again great good yeah let's put that in and then we'll see where we are
that's great that's that's that's a great deadline and that definitely gives me enough time to
that's great that's a great deadline for me thank you that's that's great and Salim if you just add
your section into the current document that's in the shared file then we've got one shared copy
that we're all working on that would be great we have done it before so yeah you'll sort of know
what we're doing with that so so is this oh yeah great so this is on the share uh the one drive
is that right yes okay it's not in the folder that you set up those but because I don't seem to have
access to put things in there but it is like it's on the one drive okay good the links in the email I
can resend it if you think that would be useful uh couldn't hurt you couldn't hurt uh I'm sure I'm
sure I have it but if you don't mind that would be great yeah thank you right let me see if I can
have you turn out or you don't worry about it I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder
so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it yeah we'll just see if I can find it
here we are here we go
right I've just really sent the email so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your
inbox now brilliant thanks a ton thanks a ton um oh good this is great so like I said I like that
this deadline um and now I must return to marking yeah and you might need more coffee I I absolutely
do so uh please please please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because uh that's vicariously
is the only way I will get to enjoy it so yeah so Dr. Moore I have been told by another academic
stuff when I told they told me during these two weeks of marking treat yourself eat the candies
eat the mass food or just to treat yourself from the marking marking strength that's great I will
thank you I'm that's great I'll I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well that's
thank you thank you thank you really great to see you all and and uh yeah I look forward to to
proceeding yeah yeah let's see if we can get something in the new year lovely good see you
happy holidays everyone take care yeah bye bye bye then

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

Hello. Hi, can you hear me? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, we can hear you, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Excellent. Sorry I'm late. I slipped my mind. I was at the coffee shop and then popped up. Anyway, sorry I'm late. Sorry, nice to see you all. How are you? Staying warm, I hope. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, great. How are you doing? Cause you were, I think you had a doctor's appointment last week. Are you OK? 

Speaker 1 

Health better. Thank you. Yeah, I'm cold, but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it. But yeah, I've been marking hell. So how are you all? 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thank you. Yes. Been doing a little bit of teaching, but just a couple of skills days for social policy. Social workers. So yeah, most of my teaching takes place next term, so I've got. I'll be buried next in semester 2. 

Speaker 3 

I'm good. 

Speaker 1 

Excellent. Well, so yeah. I I'm I'm. I'm I'm I'm I'm the opposite. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but yes, enjoy. Enjoy while you can. I haven't touched anything since we last talked, but that said it's still probably a good idea to touch base and see. What's next or what's where? Where we are just so we don't sort of get off track. Thanks a ton for the draft, I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I found the the sources and I gave it a quick read, but I haven't really done anything. I'm sorry, I've just been buried with teaching and grading so sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's OK. I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it. So it is. It is a first draft, it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and Selim might be able to contribute like sections of text. So hopefully I'm not asking you to put in anything that you're not not able and willing to contribute. 

Speaker 1 

No. Yes, of course. Thank you. I missed that though. Can you? What? What? I don't have it open. What? So I mean, obviously the the result, the methods and the results, but yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. So I've got some methodology down there, but there's obviously you you're closer to the detail of what you're doing. So yeah, methodology and results, that's it. And then once we've got that in and we can revisit the discuss. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And I've put some points down, but there will obviously be more coming out when we've got a A for the paper to work with. The other thing I'm aware that is outstanding is you'd asked us if they're given the quite high proportion that we're coming out with, whether we could just look at some simple statistics to see whether. That proportion seemed sensible and wondering Selim, have you seen that e-mail? Is that something you might be able to do? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

For us, you mean the article? 

Speaker 2 

No, the Scott's last e-mail about taking, just doing a sense check against the proportion figure that he's finding. 

Speaker 3 

No, I didn't. I I told you just now. But also for you doctor model. So I had in the last 2-3 weeks my annual review, the preparation and also the exam. That's why I didn't time with anything else. But it went well. So I passed a new review and yeah, so just update me quickly. Caroline, please. 

Speaker 2 

So I'll forward you the e-mail from Scott cause I've got it and then if you can just take it. It's not a big job, I don't think. But if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your findings. I mean Scott's very kindly indicated which questions it relates to. So it's it's literally a, a percentage, I think isn't it's got. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, the issue is just that the so we've got these like fancy schmancy techniques which are great and very preliminarily, I, I and this was weeks ago, I I I. Sup. Since then and I only had One Cup of coffee today, so this is all danger. But the the sort of where? I. Parked it mentally is we have some initial estimates using these. These sort of next generation snowball samples, for lack of a better phrase, and that is not a very good phrase. And doing that gave some really high at least it seemed to me, really high in numbers and so. I was just thinking aloud to to to Caroline, and I'd welcome any and all inputs. Is is. Just as like, what if we don't do fancy smancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the the proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern slavery? Like what is that number? I don't know that number. And whatever that number is, it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have random sample etc etc etc. But just as a something to compare to. The I don't remember the exact numbers. Caroline do. Do you remember? It was. It was in the thousands, though, wasn't it in? 

Speaker 2 

The well, it was a proportion that you gave us, wasn't it was sort of 30% or something. 

Speaker 1 

Is it proportionate? That's right, that's right. Yeah, which just sounds really high. I mean, again, is the proportion of. Of my of domestic workers who I I think, yeah, plausibly we can say even a subset of those that are that are from the Philippines or from Latin America I think because that. We're not explicitly sampling that population, but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population. I think so. And so that the percentage just seemed to sound high to me, but I don't know anything about this, so. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Well, it's possible because they have no protection. And yeah, and and that's what I I think it is possible I think it, but I think it and I think it would attract interest. So it would be good to be as sure as we can about what we're saying because this seems to be quite a an interest. There's a lot of interest in this topic when. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Jim and I published the preliminary report just looking at the descriptive. Sticks. We got a lot of media attention for that. 

Speaker 1 

OK, that's great. 

Speaker 2 

So that was not really as exciting as what we're doing here. So I'm sure there would be continued interest from, I mean there's Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today, he's sort of following our work at the Rights lab. He always keeps an idea, an eye on what press releases we create. So he would. 

Speaker 1 

Nice. 

Speaker 2 

I'm sure pick it up again. That's great. Yeah, it is. I mean, from a an impact point of view, it's. It's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd include ours in that, but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has produced a report, but it's just descriptive statistics like us. So this really does move the conversation forward and I think. 

Speaker 

Ah. 

Speaker 1 

But that's great if there's if the. I'm sorry, you're. 

Speaker 2 

Good, now it says like with the change of government, if we presumably we get the change of government, then there there's a task force which is charged with looking at this issue within the first 100 days. So it's potentially got policy impact. So I think some Andrea Rain is leading something. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 2 

This that a colleague at Nottingham Trent mentioned to me, so this is the sort of thing that her team would be interested in picking up as well. So it could be really timely. 

Speaker 1 

This is bent. This I really want to be done with grading and get back to this. This is really exciting. And that's what I was gonna say is the the. I wasn't aware of these. We're advocacy groups. I wasn't aware of sort of the specificity that like you mentioned, there's like a what was a Latin American women's. You know, that's great if if we can can and obviously you are connected to that, but that's that would be like you said that would be, yeah, I mean the more now we're having conversation and the. 

Speaker 2 

When it's right started, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Once we start sort of subsetting it down the the the the proportion, the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this conversation, so that's very exciting. If OK, there's a big caveat. The big caveat there is. So thank you, Caroline again for the opportunity and I completely agree with you that like if we can do some quantity stuff with this, yeah, that would be, you know like way better than I did. But like that's that's a contribution. It makes you a little bit anxious because it makes me think like, OK, well, we really got to get these numbers right then because like this isn't, you know, this isn't something that. There's sort of other. It's like there's a a pool of of this kind of quantity prevalence estimation that we can sort of, you know, well we're close or we're not so close. So we differ. But here's why like it's. Pretty new so. 

Speaker 2 

Just. Yeah, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I agree. And when Bernard Silverman produced the stats, the initial stats for modern slavery in the UK, he used multiple systems estimation to do that. And he produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by policymakers. Which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end, in that the the the situation was far worse than his estimation suggested. So I think you're just talking, you're part of the conversation, but the conversation keeps evolving. Yeah. And the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that are not. Correct, but that are a way of engaging people in the debate. So I think as long as we're clear about what we've done, how we've got to that, I think we're OK. 

Speaker 1 

That's a really. I think that's thank you for that, Karen. That's a really great perspective and and not one that I. Had so. So just to paraphrase, you're saying. Like, well, I mean. I mean essentially like that's how science works is you, you make some mess and you do some research and then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed or whatever. And I I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly kind. Of like well. I gotta make sure this number is, you know, right or this method is really justified. And I think you're right, that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Sort of not. That's a luxury we don't have in this particular research domain, and that's just that's that's that, right? That's that's that's not. It's not a sin against us. That's a nice perspective. I like that. That's thank you for that, Caroline. That's a good one. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, I think it's just listening to Bernard talked about his experience and yeah, I mean, I think he said that the number of slaves were between 11 and 13,000 and then later estimates suggested up to 148,000. So I mean, that was quite a significant change in the number, but. 

Speaker 1 

Right. I just, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

His his paper started that conversation and yeah. So I think it's just viewing it as this is a contribution to the debate based on these particular methods. 

Speaker 1 

Right, right. Sounds good. OK, so when I get time when? When I'm out of marking hell. What's the what's the? What's the next step or help reorient me, please. As to. 

Speaker 2 

Revealed that. 

Speaker 1 

What? What? What I can do? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I think it's trying to flesh out that draft, so I'll I can go back to it and Polish up what I've written and make sure that it cause it's not a bit less stream of consciousness and but actually it needs input from you and Celine as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The the skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit. Once you've had a chance to have a look at, it's got perhaps where you think. We might target it and whether it needs. The the sort of context setting. To. 

Speaker 1 

Good point. 

Speaker 2 

To appeal to the audience, that's the journal that we think we want to go for. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Good. OK. Thank you. That's helpful. 

Speaker 2 

And I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in my mind that a lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in Word, and I think you you do understand latex, don't you? So it might be better actually to write it in latex, which I've never used. But perhaps if we can get the draft up to a certain standard, you would be able to then transfer it for us. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, absolutely. No, it's fine, actually. And there's there's. So back in the day. You're. Right, that in fact one of my early collab. Craters. So I use latex and he didn't and we had this project and he early on he was. He was like we're never gonna publish this because we just we're just gonna clash. And so anyway I'm trying to say back in the day there was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions. It's really pretty straightforward to convert. So we can. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, are they OK, good. So we could still. 

Speaker 1 

We can still, we can still we still talk to each other should be. 

Speaker 2 

Well. 

Speaker 1 

Should be OK. 

Speaker 2 

That's right. That's right. 

Speaker 1 

But yeah, that's a good point. Salem, do you mind taking a step? I don't know. What? What let review in terms of like the methods, needs, needs or is desired, but do you feel comfortable taking a stab at that so you know the? Basically, I think I've sent along at this point troll the troll, the trove of emails I've sent. I think there's A and Caroline as well. A number of papers that that address the kinds of methods that we're using, question mark. 

Speaker 3 

So I I have written down for now. And the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the methods section in the article that Caroline sent and the second task is the forwarded e-mail. So it seems there are some task I I just had a glance into it. Look into the e-mail that Caroline just now forwarded and then asked that. For you, Doctor Mose, you're asking for some information from my end, so I will look into that. And what else is there? 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the method section of the paper I've already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies. Yeah, so? OK, so there there is a method section there. And and then. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but it's gonna be very sharp, right? 

Speaker 2 

It's OK. I mean, the whole paper is 4000 words. Currently, I don't know quite what we're we're targeting, what length we're targeting, but I've asked you specifically if you could add the network structure graphic. You remember that we put that that actually visualizes the structure of the network. And and the way the extent to which it's constructed of different waves. So that was that section. That, yeah, if you could put that section in. And then I've asked, Scott, if he could include the point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated. And then. The bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Because you know what you've done? Not so. That's those those areas are indicated in the paper. I'll just put them in. They're indicated at the moment in just normal text. I've just put them in bold. So you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier. 

Speaker 

Thank you. That's great. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And then obviously I'll I can Polish up the text, but I I don't want to spend too much time. Doing that until. 

Speaker 1 

Results. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, until we know what the over, whether it sort of hangs together as an overall narrative, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

I'll. Thank you very much, Carolina. See it. It's it's. I see what has to be done and I don't have time to do it today. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, that's the big the big problem. 

Speaker 3 

Isn't it? I could do my part or what? The weekend, and also in in, in the beginning of next week. So I'm I'm more free. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Now, great. Excellent. 

Speaker 2 

Is your. Did your timetable get a bit better in the new year then Scott? Is that going to be, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it it gets. It gets better until about I have one of these intensive things and and I plan to work. So things will get a lot better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Fiercely then. But. Yeah, for about. Not quite a week, but essentially next week I'm. I'm yeah. Anyway, it's. I mean, I see what has to be done. I can't wait to do it. And and I'm so sorry, but I simply can't right now, right. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, that's, I mean, I completely understand the teaching is something you can't ignore. 

Speaker 1 

And and and marking is just so many and the oh so many, so many, so many. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. Yeah, I feel your pain. 

Speaker 1 

Will you be? I'll sadly, or I don't know. For better. So I'll. I'll probably work over parts of the break probably until late December and e-mail and what I'm trying to say is. I'll. I'll work on this likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope you're. With your families. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'll try not to, I must admit. But my January is not too bad. So if if we can. 

Speaker 1 

In June. OK. 

Speaker 2 

And reconvene, perhaps in January. Does that suit you too, Celine? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I could do online because or even in person, I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week, but we could also meet online, so there's no problem. Yeah, online or doesn't matter. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 

Me. 

Speaker 2 

So would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've got something to in the diary to work to? 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. Yeah, let's do so. Ideally before the 15th of January maybe. 

Speaker 2 

What? What? 

Speaker 1 

And then agreed. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Do you want to pick a is Friday still going to be? Good for you, Scott. 

Speaker 1 

I mean, until teaching start, I think I don't even know my timetable for next next term, but the yeah, Fridays should be should be fine. So I I do something before the before the 15th, but after the 4th would be good for me. I think I'll. I think I'll be traveling until the 4th. So I don't know maybe. 

Speaker 3 

Add the 12th Friday the 12th June. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the 12, what's that like? 

Speaker 1 

Sure. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. And does this time work? 

Speaker 1 

Looks great for me. 

Speaker 2 

This, this, this a meeting at this time work. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, it works for me. 11:00 AM again. 

Speaker 1 

Great, good. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, let's put that in and then we'll see where we are. I'll just do. 

Speaker 1 

That's it. That's great. That's that's that's a great deadline and that the plan gives me enough time to. That's great. That's a great deadline for me. Thank you. That's. Right. 

Speaker 2 

And still in if you just add your section into the current document and that's in the shared file, then we've got 1 shared copy that we're all working on. That would be great. 

Speaker 3 

We have done that before so should be fine. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. We sort of know what we're doing with. That so that's great. 

Speaker 1 

Oh yeah, since it's on the share or the OneDrive. Is that right? OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, it is. It's it's not in the folder that you set up those spots cause I don't seem to have access to put things in there, but it is it's. On the OneDrive. 

Speaker 1 

OK, good. 

Speaker 

Thanks. 

Speaker 2 

The links in the e-mail I can resend it if you think that would be useful. 

Speaker 1 

Couldn't hurt you. Couldn't hurt. I'm sure. I'm sure I have it. But if you don't mind, that would be great. Yeah. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, let me see if I can hunt it out. 

Speaker 1 

Or don't worry about it. I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we'll just see if I can find it. Here we are. OK. Right. I just resent the the e-mail, so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your inbox now. 

Speaker 1 

Brilliant. Thanks a ton. Thanks a ton. Oh, good. That's great. So like I said, I like this deadline. And now I must return to marking, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Smoking. Yes, and he might need more coffee. 

Speaker 1 

I absolutely do. So please, please, please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because vicariously is the only way I will. Get to enjoy it so. 

Speaker 3 

So, doctor, more than I have been told by another academic staff when I told, they told me during these two weeks of marking treaties. Now eat the candies, eat fast food, or just to treat yourself from the marking, marking stress. 

Speaker 1 

That's great. I I will thank you. That's great. I'll, I'll. I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well. That's. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Should do some fantastic. 

Speaker 2 

Guys, OK. Won't hold you anymore. Then stop. Good catch up. I'm glad you're feeling better. 

Speaker 1 

Really great to see you all and and and and. Yeah, I look forward to. Proceeding. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Let's see if we can get something in the new year. Good. See you. 

Speaker 3 

And then I see your. 

Speaker 1 

Bye. Happy holidays, everyone. Take care. Bye. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Thank you. Bye. Bye then. 

 Hi everyone, I'm sorry I'm running late, the perpetual IT problems. How are you all doing?
It's good to see you. It just seems such a long time since we've met. I was saying to
Celine, have I seen you since Christmas and I haven't done what we met at the beginning of
December I think last time? That's right. Gosh, doesn't the time fly? It sure does. In fact,
I never know when it's too late to say this, but happy new year, happy 2024.
I hope it's off to a good start, but now even January is gone, so yeah, time really is flying,
but hopefully y'all are enjoying 2024 as it is. It's pretty busy. It seems that way.
So this is your heavy teaching term, is that right? Yeah, that's right. We were just talking
about teaching, weren't we? I'm still stuck with, I just can't, marking just never seems to end.
It's just forever. I know and eat cakes, which you are very kind to suggest to Celine, but
yeah, I just keep thinking like, okay, once I get this done, then I can do x or y and it
never ends, but anyway. I'm so, so glad we found time for this. Thank you so much everyone.
I confess, I haven't, I tried to prepare a little bit, but I don't exactly, thank you for your memo
or agenda, Caroline, let me pull it up. Yeah, I thought that just might help us sort of try
and cover off the main things that you discussed in your videos, which were great, by the way.
Really good idea to sort of capture it, capture your thinking about particular stage.
The honest truth is, I'm so bad at typing and spelling that I just figure my
healer recording is often just much more efficient. But thank you for taking the
time to be in and summarize. I think that's exactly right. What do you think?
I think it's great. I'm so pleased that you think we're still in with a shot with this
data. I think it's just fantastic what you're doing and whatever support I can give you,
and well, I can't speak for Celine, but let him speak for himself. But yeah, I think it's
really, really interesting how you're thinking about it, how you're conceptualizing the data
and these new approaches that you've suggested, I think it's fantastic.
It's all from, it's all thanks to you all. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be anywhere near
this project, we're not for you all. So thank you. So am I right in thinking about this though?
So the population are domestic workers in the UK, and then the hidden population are those
that are experiencing modern slavery. Pardon me one second, just realize my back leg. Give me one
second to not look like a monster. I'm sorry about that. I'm very sorry. And that the hidden
population are domestic workers in the UK that are experiencing modern slavery and we can catch
that out in one of three different ways, I think. So dichotomously, which again, I think, and
Carolyn, you get credit for this, the two questions I don't remember at the top of my head,
it was like 36 and 80 or something. They're very, in my opinion, they're very high bar.
And so I think that's great. And then there's this kind of risk index that we put together,
which could be like another. So help me out. So if we use this continuous risk index,
then isn't the population that we're sampling from or I guess what I'm trying to say is
are we making an assumption that everyone in the population is
has some degree to exposure of risk of experiencing modern slavery?
Yeah, this is interesting because the two indicators and I've picked up your question
number. So I hope they are correct. Selim will be able to check for us. But there are two
the way that exploitation is currently conceptualized is on a spectrum. And at one end, you have
minor infringements such as the national living wage, which would be the question 36. Are you
paid sufficiently? And then at the extreme exploitation end, you'd have modern slavery
question 80. So we've got two discreet markers on that scale. So I wouldn't equate
failure to pay the national living wage with modern slavery. I don't think we can say that
conceptually, but it is a form of exploitation and modern slavery is the most extreme form of
exploitation. And then so we've got those two that you've sort of very cleverly identified as
dichotomous variables, you're either a modern slave or you're not. And if you're either paid
illegally or you're not. And then we've got this risk index, which is a more the gray area in
between, which is the this composite variable. Does that help? Perfect. It helps a ton. No,
thank you for and this is again, this is why it's so awesome to work with you all. But
so I even my language was wrong. It's actually be thinking about exploitation. And modern slavery
is one extreme form of exploitation. But really, that there's this spectrum, and that that's
enormously helpful that that helps me in thinking about the. Yeah, okay, that's really great. So
then in that case, okay, so then the, the, the, the population is still domestic workers in the UK.
I'm just thinking aloud, sorry for that domestic workers in the UK. And then we're the hidden
population are exploited workers with then exploited domestic workers in the UK, where
that exploit measuring that exploitation, we do in three different ways. One is this sort of
minimal one is maximal and one is this, like you said, the gray area. I love that. I think that's
I didn't even, I didn't really, I didn't, Caroline, okay, good. Okay, so in that case, the, so, so,
so the, I guess one thing I can say, and I think I said the videos, I am surprised at how much more
confident I am in the estimates from way back when currently they seem, I'm willing to put my name
to them. I mean, they seem quite real. They're, they're, they're, in my opinion, they're shockingly
high. They're, they're very consistently depending on a bunch of model parameters, but sort of 30%
is a conservative estimate. So there's something like 30 to 40%. So, so the interpretation there is
again, depending on how we think about and measure exploitation, 30 to 40% of domestic
workers in the UK are experiencing some form of exploitation. And in fact, I can even tell you
the, the maximal one I was just looking at it is, so was it, it's question 80 is the, is the more
extreme one. Yeah, 30.7% is the estimate with a pretty reasonable estimate of uncertainty.
So I think this will make our message much more, it sort of tones it down a bit if we talk about
exploitation. If we talked about 30, 40% in modern slavery, that's very dramatic. Yes. And we'll be
a front page of the Guardian, which we don't necessarily want to be that dramatic. So I think
if we talk about labor exposition, it just tones it down slightly. And we're acknowledging that
modern slavery is an extreme form, but it's not the sole focus of the topic. So hopefully that
makes you feel a bit more comfortable about the size of the problem as well. It does. And, and
like I said, thank you. I'm so glad. And I don't know, I feel kind of foolish actually, because
like the more we talk, the more I realize, Oh, actually, I'm not, I haven't actually been thinking.
Anyway, so like this modern slavery versus exploitation business is, yeah, now these
results make a lot of sense. I mean, they're really, really high, but they're consistent. And if you,
so for example, if you look at the estimated proportion that are experiencing this extreme
form of slavery, it's 12% less than the estimated proportion of those experiencing the mildest form
of exploitation, which logically makes perfect sense. And the intervals makes some sense.
That's good. So that's sort of sanity. So I suppose that on what we, what I have done when I put
the composite together was mixed up these fair, the dichotomous and the continuous variable. So
we need to separate that out now, obviously. So we have another stab at that. So you, did you follow
that? The logic that Scott sent through about this difference between, because I've mixed up
labor exploitation, question 30, whatever it is, with the other risk indicators of forced labor,
I put it as a weighting at 0.3. And actually, we can't do that. Well, I can't do that.
Because it that'll affect the composite variable calculation. So it won't be accurate the way
I've currently specified it. I don't know which document or email you're referring to.
I know there's been the email video record from Dr. Mauser, and you have responded to it
just before this meeting. So you sent me an email before this meeting. Right. You know,
this was really sort of what came out of Scott's earlier. I can't remember when we discussed it.
Let me revise the composite measures and send those through to you. Well, send them through to
both of you, but particularly to Selim, because we'll need to recalculate those composite values
based on the understanding that we've mixed up a dichotomous variable with a continuous
risk indication variable. If you sent me the document or whatever, I should
just recalculate it. I can do that. No problem. Brilliant. I'm sorry it's extra work because
it means going back and redoing something that we'd already asked you to do. That's part of the
work. It's much clearer now. I think we're sort of learning as we go up. It's heuristic.
But so hang on, Caroline. I think I'm about to have a second mental breakthrough for the day.
So I understand the composite measure that we made is like this weighted sum of these various
indicators, but I missed why you think it... What's wrong with it? Because I've included
question 36, and I've given it a slightly heavier weighting, but I've included it
within the composite risk. I see. So I think I wasn't very happy when I did it, and I think
it's probably better if we split it out. And then we've got this clarity about
these two, the question 36 and the question 80, are clearly illegal activities, but at
different ends of the scale. And the other risk factors provide a composite picture,
which could be indicative of forced labour. It's much cleaner if we do it that way.
Okay. I think I see now. So it's not necessarily the case that... I think, again, thank you so
much. So I was originally thinking, okay, exploitation is on a spectrum. We have these
two kind of endpoints, question 36 and question 80, and that the composite measure would sort of be
in between these two endpoints. But if I'm understanding you, that's not really the
right way to think about it. We have... So, okay, that's one way to interpret. Here's a
second way to interpret. Yes, exploitation is on a continuum, and here we have indicators for the
endpoints. And then separately, we have this continuous indicator, which doesn't necessarily
fit in between these two endpoints. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but it's not the case that...
Does that make sense? It's not the case... Yeah, I think that's more accurate, it's separate.
I think it's separate. Again, thank you so much. Seriously, that was a second...
In the last 15 minutes, you've given me two... Okay, that's very helpful. And actually, that
will help me in interpreting the... I was a bit uncertain how to interpret the estimate of the
continuous indicator, but this discussion helps me a lot in understanding what those results are
saying relative to the dichotomous measures. So, thank you. So, that was clear to me from
your discussion about this difference between dichotomous variables and a continuous one.
So, I think if you're happy with that approach, I think that sort of moves this forward, although
it means redoing a bit of work. Perfect, and also just to be totally clear, I wasn't aware
that's what I was saying. So, really, you get credit for that, Caroline, completely. That's
really... No, no, that's awesome. Okay, so that's a huge clarification. I do have... And I don't want
to hijack the conversation at all. I have sort of a big, I guess, two medium-sized questions,
and then some really kind of obnoxious, small, but technical questions, if I may.
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. So, the... Okay, I guess maybe... Okay, let me do the small ones first.
So, right. So, the don't know is the data stuff is fine. There's one nagging data
issue that I still have, and it's this business about zeros. So, some people... I don't remember,
I think I said 17 or something, a handful of people report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK.
So, the reporting that their network size is zero. Now, some of these are clearly an error,
because then when it comes to the referral question, can you give us the cell phone of a
domestic worker in the UK? They provide one. So, some people who say, I know zero people in the
UK, then provide a cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK. So, clearly, those people are wrong.
So, I'm comfortable sort of finding them and turning their zeros into at least one. Again,
that's conservative, because we know that they've reported at least one. So, one... Okay, so that's
one issue. And then two, there's still some extra zeros. Some people who say, no, I know zero people
in... Sorry, I know zero domestic workers in the UK, and I've reported zero. And I don't exactly
know why, but those zeros are messing up the estimators. The estimators can't handle... I'm
guessing it's like a divide by zero problem or something like that, where... So, the question is,
what to do with the true zeros? Two options. One is we just sort of
gin it up and say, let's just add one for everybody, which isn't really...
I mean, it solves a problem technically, but it's really, really sketchy. Or two,
remove the true zeros. So, what to do with the true zeros is one question. And then the easier
question is, what do we think about turning the wrong zeros into ones? Are we comfortable with
that? Again, we're talking about a handful of people, but with a sample size of 97,
a handful of people is not true. So, does that make sense? The two questions make sense?
Are my... Yes, no, it does make sense. I mean, I'm tempted to say, take them out. I don't know what
that does to the... That seems... Because anything else is a fudge, isn't it? Exactly, exactly. So,
what I have been doing is just adding one to everybody and just saying... But I completely
agree with you that what it does is it does increase our uncertainty. And I think it increases it
a bit. I don't remember exactly, but I agree with you that that's the most principled. Are we okay
turning the zeros into ones for people who do the nominate or make a referral? Or should we...
Are we turning them into the number that they nominate? Yeah, exactly. So, if they nominated
two people, we turn them into twos. And then one, if they nominate one, is that how we're doing it?
Exactly. That's how we could do it, which I... Yeah, we can do it. I'm comfortable with that
myself if you all are. Yeah, I think if we take out the ones that are through zeros,
I don't know what the implications of that has for how we're sampling. But I mean, if we just say
that's what we've done, it's a limitation of the estimating technique, really, isn't it?
Yes, that's right. It's not a data limitation. It's not a data limitation. It's an estimation.
You're 100% right. Yeah, it's a limitation of the estimation. That's right. Sorry.
Yeah, so I think we can probably just say that.
So it's... And so we've got two things that we're doing then. So we're taking out
the true... The ones that really are zeros. And for the ones that do nominate,
we're then increasing their... We're correcting the data. Yes, exactly.
To reflect that they do know...
They do have other people in there. They do have other domestic workers in their networks.
Yes, exactly. And I think that's conservative. But I have to say, what I mean is I think...
What we're doing is we're saying, well, we don't know this person's degree size. We know that it's an
error. And so we're assigning it a value that's the smallest possible size it could be. If you've
nominated two people, given two cell phone numbers, we know that you know at least two...
Maybe you know more that you just haven't nominated. So by changing the zero to a two in that case,
I think what we're doing is we're underestimating that person's network size, which I think is
conservative. What I mean is I think that won't inflate our estimates. I think. I should double
check that though. But if it's... I'm almost sure it is. But anyway, that should be my homework.
But if so, then I think that's perfectly fine. Because we're kind of shooting ourselves in
the foot really. So whatever we find is gonna be... Yeah, I think it's gonna be fine. So
because the degree size... Yeah. So there's sort of two-part solutions to that problem.
So we take out the true ones, and then we
modify the data to reflect the actual sample size for the others.
Those both sound reasonable to me. Selim, does that sound okay?
I have the similar suggestion that you have made. Based on the number or the amount of people they
have provided the phone numbers. So we could take the amount of the phone numbers they have provided,
although they have reported in the earlier question that they don't know any other domestic
workers in the UK. So modifying it should make it consistent with the other existing
survey findings. Good. Excellent. Great. Thank you. Okay. Now that's what that is. Excellent.
So, let's see. In increasing order of easiness.
Yeah. Increasing order of easiness. Okay, I'll save this. So what do we want to see? But that's at
the end. Domestic worker size. So I went back and double-checked, and it's true.
The thing that we're estimating is a proportion. But to do that, one of the inputs... So we have
this R data, and we have a bunch of parameters, and all that's great. One of the inputs that's
required for the estimators that I'm currently using, not for the INSOM estimator, but for the
RDS estimators, is a guess, is a prior belief on the size of the population that we're sampling from.
So what that means is, ideally, we would know how many domestic workers there are in the UK
with a cell phone. So we know the number, the size of the population that we're sampling from.
And of course, not necessarily the number of those experiencing exploitation.
This doesn't have to be a hard and fast number. It can be like, well, here's my best guess,
or here's a ranger, or whatever, whatever. But we need that number. And I've been looking,
I thought it would be easy to find a labor statistic site or something. And I haven't come
up with a great number, or one that I'm super happy with. My best guess is something like 1.7 million,
which sounds a bit high. But then again, there's a lot of people in the UK. Anyway,
so if you have suggestions on where to get reliable information on the number of domestic
workers in the UK in the period that you all were sampling, that would be great.
What I've been doing is just making up numbers. And I've been making up numbers and increasing
them by orders of magnitude. So suppose there's 10,000. Suppose there's 100,000. Suppose there's
a million, and seeing how, just as a very crude way to see how those inputs affect the outputs.
And the good news is they seem to affect the outputs not very much. So this is great news,
actually. This means our estimates are relatively insensitive to the prior knowledge, namely the
number of domestic workers in the UK. That said, at some point, we'll need to settle on a number
that we'll use. And of course, we'll say see appendix for robustness. But for the stuff that
we report, I'll need a number. Does anyone have any thoughts on where to find information on that?
Well, the only thing that we've suggested in the past, which may not be very helpful,
is the overseas domestic worker visa numbers. Because that is a fixed statistic that
ought to relate to how many visas for a six month period, because they last for six months,
and then they expire, and people have to go home, in theory. And I can't remember off the top of
my head what that number was, but I think it was around 76,000. It sounds about right. Yeah, yeah.
So if we, I mean, that's my best stab at an official statistic. I don't know if you've come
across anything. We have adopted to the most recent publishing from, I think it was also in
Guardian, and it also referred Guardian of Times, that news article, and it also referred to the
Government UK page. So they regularly published that. So yeah, it was about 70 or 80,000, I think.
So I don't know how satisfactory that is. I haven't, I'm not familiar with the web pages
you mentioned that you looked at. So if it's possible to send me the link, I could have a look
and see if I can, if that sort of turns into any more robust ideas. But at the moment,
the only thing I can suggest, which doesn't help us for the non British, sorry, for the British
Nationals, but. Yeah, a bit. I mean, it's fine. The good news is like the quality of results are
really, really robust, again, surprisingly robust. So, you know, we can see, here's a number that we
can use and we can give a site to and say, clearly, this is an underestimate. Again, C appendix B for
sensitivity analysis. Yeah, I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm perfectly fine with that because the
results are again, qualitatively are really consistent. So I'm fine with that. So, so no,
thank you for that. Thank you for that. Okay, I've got two more on one, what at least one I think
is a bit is a bit tricky. So I've been as to so I you can identify three groups, three subgroups
here, at least I'm sure you all could probably identify more. Those by ethnicity, so those coming
from the Philippines. Those are easy to identify. Those that come from some Spanish speaking countries,
like Bolivia, Colombia, but also Spain, and UK nationals who aren't one of these who aren't in the
first two categories. The question is, do we want to do anything with that information in the
following sense? In fact, Caroline, you suggested we could perform estimation separately, like
completely separately, like, like, just use this group data, just use this data, just use this
data and get three different sets. The UK people, I mean, it's really small. So the main interest
is on the, now, so for the Philippines, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I wanted to get your thoughts
on, well, so the general question is, do we want to do anything with that information? Here are
some things we could do. Split them up into three groups, perform analyses separately, but especially
between the two non-UK national groups. Question mark. If so, how comfortable are we group, the
Philippine one, the Philippine group subgroup seems pretty very straightforward, very justified to me.
Are we okay lumping Ecuadorians with Bolivians with Spanish, you know, sort of putting all
Spanish people coming from Spanish speaking countries together? When I say together, I mean in
the same subgroup, to which we will perform our estimation. What do you think?
I don't know what sensitivities we might be, and the thing that comes to mind is Burt,
if I'm not Burt, and his class, have you ever read a paper by Cyril Burt about,
it's highly controversial, racist science, and actually he lumped people together and measured
their brain size and then concluded that people in certain racial groups had smaller brains.
I remember this, yeah. And there's been a huge critique, obviously, of this paper,
and it was depicted as racist science because of the assumptions that he made when he grouped
people. And I don't know what the sensitivities are about grouping Ecuadorians and Spanish people
into some sort of larger category. And I don't know whether that any, if we did that it would,
I don't know either. Stand the test of time, or whether we might be called out in the future for
some sort of atrocity that we don't even know we're committing. Okay. So I don't know about that.
I want, is there value in doing the Filipino grouping to me as far as I can predict sounds safer?
Yeah. And is it, does it show any distinction, any distinct differences from taking the,
I don't know. I tell you to take your point. Thank you. It's a very good, I hadn't even thought
about the sort of test of time aspect. That's a really, really good point. My one reason for
doing, my reason for doing this is twofold. One is just very, very technical because the
estimators that I'm using have this underlying assumption that truly in the world the social
network is connected, which means that there's some path between the Ecuadorian in our sample
and the Filipino in our sample. Somebody, this person knows somebody who knows somebody who
knows somebody who knows this person. Fine. We don't have to make that assumption,
but it makes my life a lot easier. I think there's reasons to challenge that assumption,
namely by language, for example, you might think that this, that a group of
Philippine domestic workers are, are separate, are separated from
maybe, and maybe that's the racist of me to say in the first place, but
I'm not suggesting we're being racist. I'm just using that as an example, but I think
Bert did when he realized he was making a racist assumption when he did it. I think we just have
to be careful that we might not understand the assumptions we're making. I think that's
right. So what I'm hearing from you is maybe just don't subgroup. Well, the second reason I was,
I raised this, I wanted to separate this is because, because of these, in my opinion,
relatively large estimated proportions, I was curious about heterogeneity, right? Like where,
where are these big numbers coming from, basically? So that was sort of a more substantive
motivation. And to answer your question, Caroline, I don't know. I haven't actually performed,
I haven't done the estimation by subgroup. So I don't even know if there's anything interesting
there. So maybe I should do that first. This might be moot, I guess is,
I don't know the answer to your question. But what I'm hearing is like, play it safe and don't,
maybe it's not such a good idea. Maybe we just leave, we leave the analysis at the,
using the entire sample all at once and just state the assumptions and move on.
I don't know. It's tempting. It's tempting to have a look at it. I mean, particularly for me,
for the Filipino group, because we've got quite a large, two thirds of the group is Filipino. So
could we somehow test the distinction between the Filipino group and the broader sample?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
That strikes me as being a sort of safe test. Initially, dip our toe in the water
with hopefully out and not offending anybody by, by means that we know that we don't understand.
And like I said, that's actually, on my end, that's a much easier data task,
because identifying that subgroup is just easier.
Nicely, clearly delineated.
Yeah. So thank you. I'll do that and include that in my next, like I said, I haven't,
I just haven't done that analysis. But yeah, I'll do that. Okay, that sounds great.
Okay, so the last hard question is, what do we want to present? What do you want me to make tables?
Do you want me to make pictures? Do you want me to make p values? Like what, what do we want to,
from the results, what do we want to show? And how do we want to show it? I don't know if I'm
being clear. I'm probably being overly vague, aren't I? So we'll have.
Thank you. No, I think it's a really, really reasonable question. It's just one I don't think
that I know the answer to. So I suppose it's tied into where we think this might be publishable.
And how technical a journal that is, and whether it's a journal that would
require that sort of technical detail, or if we were publishing in a more lay journal,
for want of a better way of putting it, whether that would be a turn off because they just,
it depends, I suppose, who's going to review it? And what are they going to expect to see?
Because we talked about various journal articles, sorry, journal at which we talked
about the Journal of Modern Slavery, where I'm sure that I don't think it would be going,
well, I may not be right, then it might be going to statistical experts
in whatever technique we finally land on. So, because there is quite a lot of
prevalence estimation within the modern slavery literature, so there will be people who do have
statistical understanding. But I think you'd also mentioned was it POS, PLS? And really,
I don't know anything about what their readership would expect. They're pretty technical. So modern
slavery you're saying is a pretty technical, or at least they have technical competences?
Well, I think there is increasing interest in prevalence within the modern slavery literature.
There are recognised practitioners, I'm thinking of Clifford Zines at Nork,
they do a lot of prevalence estimation, they work in the modern slavery field,
so I would say if you're suggesting reviewers, it's that research group that potentially
I'd identify as being a potential reviewer. No, I'm taking notes, thank you. Okay, so
to make my life easy, it sounds like I'll start with just text, you know, point estimates,
confidence intervals, whatever. Personally, I'm very, very visual, so I think pictures are
easier to interpret for me than words, but it's also more work on my part. So it sounds like
I'll start with point estimates, confidence intervals, so the plain James, so to speak,
but vanilla I should say, ways of presentation, and then we can tweak from if we need to,
when we get closer to submission. Is that what I'm hearing? Is that sound right?
Yeah, I think I don't think I can add anything particularly helpful
to this conversation, other than just trying to tailor it to whatever outlet we go for.
Yeah, I do like diagrams, and I think Celine's already added a sort of representation of the
network. So something along those lines really helps to make the hard statistics more understandable.
So yeah, I agree with you that diagrams have great explanatory power.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, okay, I'll, good, but that's not good. So I'll sort of, well,
I'll start and then, like I said, we can revisit this when we get closer to submission, but just,
no, that's helpful for me, that's very, very helpful for me. I think those are all my questions.
Let me double check, please. Oh, and you're right, I do, I haven't, there's this third
protractor, I'm getting increasingly excited by or about that I haven't done, which is this
combining the RDS with the, yeah, your 0.7, Caroline, exactly. Everything I've done and
we've talked about is very off the shelf, which is fine. I'm not at all, I mean, these are,
this is absolutely proper, but there is this, initially way back when I started talking about
this, you had this very cool idea to do in some estimation and talked and thought and Scott
thought some more and read some more and confused himself and, but yeah, there is,
there definitely is this way to combine the two. I haven't done it, it will be manual, but I'm,
I'm very excited by it, about it, mainly for the comparison, because, you know, all of these RDS
techniques are giving relatively the same, you know, 30, 40% depending on XYZ, whatever.
But there are all this class of estimators are all giving similar, but in my opinion,
really high estimates and really curious to see how this sort of, you know, this outsider,
this outsider in some method would, would, would compare. It's also cool because there's
a sense in which it's, it's, it's using more information that you already have in your sample,
which I think is, I'm always a huge fan of, of that, you know, using all the data that you can.
So I haven't done that. I don't know what your thoughts on, like, is that,
should I make that a priority? Is that, is the, is the RDS enough? Do you have any thoughts?
It sounds really exciting. I mean, it's, you've got the time to do it, but she's always,
we don't, we never have time to do anything. But if you want, if you find there is time,
then it sounds really exciting and really interesting. And that is where we started
this journey, trying to work out how to do nuisance. So to try and, if we, if we can,
if our data can say anything along those lines, that would be really exciting.
Yeah, I agree. And even if I'm, again, it depends on where we're going, but it's,
it's not like the Journal of the American Statistical Association. I mean, it's not,
what I'm trying to say is there is a, there is a methodological innovation here. It's not
huge. It's sort of taking this paper and taking this paper and recognizing that
they have the same D and I can use that, I can put them together. But I haven't seen it done.
And I think it's, I think it's a very cool idea to, to, to combine these two. And like,
like you said, Gerlain, like since, since, I mean, the information's there, it's sitting in our
Excel file, right? Like, why not? Okay. So if we're going to do that then, I might ask one
piece of help from Celine or whoever. And that's to code up the bootstrapping
procedure. So I can do the estimator, but we'll need to estimate the uncertainty.
And we know how to do that. It's with the paper that actually you
summarize and included, Gerlain, and your bootstrapping doc.
But we'll have to, we'll have to write that up in R. Can you do that,
Celine? Or is that not something you're comfortable with?
I can start looking into it.
Okay. That'd be great.
And then I will update you.
Wonderful. The,
Oh, that's a song.
I'll email you both with the, let me make notes here, bootstrap.
It, there's a lot already written. You've got a good head start in that, like, there's,
the paper is pretty readable. They have some supplementary information. They have some R code
already. So you, you're not starting from scratch, but it would, you will need,
well, we will need at some point to implement this for this particular method.
It would be a big help to me if I could do the estimation part and you could work on the
bootstrap part and then poof, and then press publish.
Can you, can you shout this paper again?
Yeah, absolutely. I'll share the paper and the, the supplemental information.
There is bootstrap. I'm just making notes to myself, but yeah, that's absolutely fine.
And I'm glad to hear that you're excited about the insum too,
Caroline. That, that's invigorating. That's, that, that, that, that helps, that helps me.
I like, I like that.
Yeah, that sounds really good.
I think, I think there's one thing we have missed from your,
from that list and your video. I don't think we've talked about number two,
which was,
Yes.
How, how we, how we've dealt with the don't knows in the data at the moment.
Good point.
And we perhaps need to, to code them slightly differently.
Perhaps as missing. I think that was your suggestion.
Yes. And so I've, I, and please do not take any offense whatsoever.
Slim, your, your, your, your recoding is, is absolutely, you know, invaluable.
But I did change it a little bit in that, I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think you had been coding.
So, so, so the issue is there's, there's, there's these different categories that one can answer,
of course. And almost always one of the answers is don't know or not,
don't prefer, prefer not to say or what have you.
And slim, you had been coding those replies as an absence of exploitation, however measured
in whatever type of exploitation. And I've recoded those as just missing.
So you just take those observations out. Again, that's a bit conservative because that,
because by, wait, is it? No, it's anti-conservative. So the absence of, yeah. So, right, my bad.
That's anti-conservative because by removing the, by taking, okay, two options. People who say
don't know are not experiencing exploitation. People who say don't know are not in our analysis.
Here's Salim's initial way. Here's what I, what I'm suggesting. Now that I'm thinking about it,
I think my suggested way is, is, is anti-conservative because
relatively speaking, it'll look like there's more people in exploitation
using my method than Salim's method. Hmm. Interesting. Caroline, thanks for bringing
this up. I had, I missed this. Yes. So the question is, what do we want to do with the
don't knows? That's exactly right. Okay. I'm just following what you're saying about
if you take them out. I think that's right. And it makes things look
worse. Yeah, worse, worse, worse, right, right. I think that's right. Because they had been coded
as not experiencing exploitation. Exactly. Yeah, which is not really what we want to do. I suppose
by nature, I would be more conservative.
So we don't want, given that we've already got 30 to 40 percent of the population.
Yeah. We don't want to make it, make it look even worse. Yeah. So we could say that. We could say,
we're, here's what we're calling the don't knows. And by the way, that's conservative because
yeah, we're, because really we're making a judgment call. We just as easily could say, well,
no, actually the don't knows are experiencing exploitation. I mean, it's arbitrary, right?
Like how, how, how, so in, in putting it in the not experiencing
exploitation, counting them as not experiencing exploitation. Yeah, I agree with you, Caroline.
It's, it's making our, yeah, it's conservative because then our estimated proportion of those
experiencing, yeah, the estimate proportion would be small. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. My apologies,
Celine. I did, I, you had it right all along. My bad. My bad. No, it's really useful clarification
that so we could, and we just sort of being clear about what we're doing, but it's good that we
don't have to recode it. So yeah, no, that's great. I think we're airing on the side of caution. So
that seems to me the right way to, to be airing. Agreed. Brilliant. Thank you. I've been trying
to type up what we've agreed just on the same email. The only one I haven't got anything against
is six. What did we say? Oh, the six is just a statement, really.
You would just, the current method you've been using for analysis and what it does.
Yeah. So I finally sort of wrapped my head around these RDS math, sort of in, in, in a way that I
should have ages ago. And I sort of, I see what they're all, they're all, they're all doing the
same thing. And they're all just making a little bit of adjustments differently. And so what I'm
thinking of doing is saying, you know, when we review the literature, like, okay, here's,
here's all these various RDS methods. And yeah, they all have different assumptions.
And we're going to do all of them, but in the appendix. And here's the one that we're going to
pick to present, because in fact, actually the one, I found one even better than the SS,
RDS, or RDSSS, called the Model Assisted, I like it better at least. But the point is we have all
these sort of related methods, these RDS methods. And my thinking is to just pick one for presentation
in the main text, and then say, you know, see appendix, whatever, for, for comparison. And
the, the estimates really are quite different. And, but again, for us, the numbers are virtually
identical, weirdly. So, yeah, I know, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that means something
about robustness, I think. That's my, that's not rigorous, but that's sort of my, my thinking is
that, or it could mean something else. And it could mean that that whole debate in the prevalence
literature is, is wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles, you know, is, is doesn't really matter. It could,
it could mean that the differences in the assumptions and the way that the different weights
are calculated doesn't really matter very much is what it could mean. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.
But regarding point six, is that, is that, are we cool with me simply picking one for
presentation purposes? And then, you know, here's the Boltzmann-Hoff estimator, and here's the
Geil SS estimator, and here's the model assisted estimator, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
or, or should we, or alternatively, I guess we could just pick one and just justify it as
strongly as, as we can. I don't know. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah. I think we have to
have a reason for picking the one that we picked, but that's up to us. I'm happy to be guided by you
on that. That's very polite and very clever of you. They think that's very good, Caroline.
Well, the reason I'm, I'm a little bit hemming and hawing is that there's, there's basically two
that I think are sort of the clear. Yeah, exactly. And, and I don't really have a strong preference
on either. So that's, that's more homework for me, I suppose. The
Yeah. Yeah. Well, the homework bit is the justification, right? And like, I've got to pick
one. And so, right, so two are easy to justify with one of the two. I mean, again, at the end
of the day, subjectively doesn't, it's not going to matter because the all, but, but you're 100%
right. Like we got to pick one to use in the main text to show the results of, you know,
to do the bootstraps for them, whatever. So that's a, yeah, that's, that's,
all right. That's on me. That's on me. Very good. Very good. Thank you for bringing that up, Caroline.
Again, thank you for bringing that up. It's just brought up really great points. So thanks.
Right. I think we're there. Brilliant. It's really exciting. This is a lovely conversation to have
on a Friday. We should do it more often. I'd love to. Yeah.
Is it sensible to try and put a provisional meeting date in the diary, just in case
it keeps us sort of at least talking about when we can meet, even if we find nearer to the time
that we can't. And our Friday is generally okay for everybody. I can generally do a Friday.
Selim, you're nodding. Scott, this afternoon. It would have to be
definitely after one, likely. So this time is fine. Two is totally fine. But yeah, Friday after one.
So if I pop another date in a month's time,
or sooner, sooner, yeah. Okay. Then sort of three weeks, two weeks.
Selim, how much time do you have to, okay. Yeah. Anything's good for me. Well,
once I finish marking, anything's good with me, which should happen this weekend. So,
yeah, I'll have time this term. So whenever, it's fine for me.
All right, Selim, what did you say? Two or three weeks, which one would you like?
The 16th of February. Okay. Again, two p.m. or before noon, or before noon time.
It's okay. Two p.m. Yeah. Yeah. Let's put that in and we'll see what happens when we get there.
And we can always jiggle it about a bit if we need to. But yeah, that's super.
So for my tasks, before we end the conversation, I will do that coding up for the bootstrapping.
And Dr. Moser, you said you would share that paper with me and some information for what I should do
and how I do it. And Caroline, you mentioned earlier something about checking or rechecking
the composite measures. Yes. Yeah, recalculating the composite measure. I'll send you a one
page of what I think now ought to be in it. Okay, this will be helpful. Yeah. So I'll try and do
that as soon as I can, which probably means I have to try and do it this afternoon. And then we'll,
yeah. And then, yeah, if you can just recalculate a risk variable two, if we keep the original,
but we'll try another column with a revised composite and then we haven't lost anything.
But I think at the moment it's wrong as it stands for how we're conceptualizing the data.
Brilliant. Thanks, everyone. It's really nice to see you all and happy 2024. So all right,
we'll email and talk soon. Yeah, I'll send out the points of the note that I made so we've all
got a copy. Brilliant. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
Thank you.

Speaker 1 

Hi everyone, sorry running late all the perpetual. It problems. How are you all doing happy? 

Speaker 2 

It's good to see you. Yes, we're just catching up with it. Just seems such a long time since we've met. I was saying to Celine my have I seen you since Christmas and I haven't done what we met at the beginning of December. I think last time Dash doesn't the time fly. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. I it sure does, and in fact I I never know when it's too late to say this, but happy, happy New Year. Happy 2024. 

Speaker 3 

Happy New Year all. 

Speaker 1 

Hope it's hope it's off to a good start, but now even January is gone. So yeah, time really is flying. But hopefully you all are are enjoying enjoying 2024 as it is. 

Speaker 2 

It's pretty busy. 

Speaker 1 

It seems that way this is so. This is your heavy teaching term. Is that right? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's right. We were just talking about teaching workloads. 

Speaker 1 

I'm I'm still stuck with. I can't. I just can't. Marking just never seems to end. It's just. 

Speaker 2 

It's just, it's just forever. 

Speaker 3 

You just need to do it. 

Speaker 1 

I I know and and and eat. Cakes which you. Were very kind to suggest to cilium, but uh yeah, I just. I keep thinking like, you know, OK, once I once I get this done then I can once I get this done then I can do you know X or Y. And it. Never ends, but anyway I'm. I'm so so glad for. We found time for this. Thank you so much, everyone. I confess I haven't. I tried to prepare a little bit, but I don't exactly thank you for your memo or agenda. Uh, Caroline the let me pull it up the. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I thought that just might help us sort of try and cover off the main things that you discussed in your videos, which were great by the way, really good idea to to sort of capture it. 

Speaker 1 

Took the time. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Capture your thinking at that particular stage. 

Speaker 1 

The the the the honest truth is I'm so bad at typing and spelling that I just figure making the recording is often just much more efficient. So, but thank you for taking the time to get and summarize. I think that's that's exactly right. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

I think it's great. I think it. I'm so pleased that you you think we're still in with a shot with this data. I think it's just fantastic what you're what you're doing and and whatever support I can give you and well I can't speak to slim but and and let him speak for himself. But yeah, I think it's really really interesting what. That how you're thinking about it, how you're conceptualizing the data and these new approaches that you've suggested, I think it's fantastic. 

Speaker 1 

It's it's all from. It's all thanks to you all. I mean, I wouldn't I. I wouldn't be anywhere near this project were it not for, not for you all. So, so, so no, thank you. So am I right in thinking about this that I mean, so the population are domestic workers in the UK and then the hidden population are those that are experiencing modern slavery. Probably once you just realized my backlog. Give me one second. Not look like a monster. I'm sorry about. Very sorry and that the the hidden population are domestic workers in the UK that are experiencing modern slavery, and we can catch that out in one of three different ways. I think. So dichotomously, which again I think and Caroline, you get credit for this. The two questions I don't remember top of my head was like 36 and 80 or something. They're very, in my opinion, they're very high bar and and so I think that's great. And then there's this kind of. Risk index that we put together, which could be like another. So so help me out. So if if we use this continuous risk index then isn't the population that we're sampling from or I guess I'm trying to say is? Aren't we making an assumption that everyone in? The population is. Has some degree to exposure of. Risk of experiencing modern slavery. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, this is interesting because the two indicators and I've picked up your question number, so I hope they are correct, silly. We'll be able to check for us, but there there are two you the way that exploitation is currently conceptualized is on a spec. Room and at one end you have minor infringements such as the National Living wage, which would be the question 36 are you paid sufficiently? And then at the extreme exploitation end, you'd have modern slavery question 80. So we've got two discrete markers on that scale. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So I wouldn't equate OK, failure to pay the national living wage with modern slavery. I don't think we can say that conceptually, but it is a form of exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And modern slavery is the most extreme form of exploitation. 

Speaker 

See. 

Speaker 2 

And then so we've got those two that you've sort of very cleverly identified as dichotomous variables. You're either slightly or not and you're either paid. Illegally or you're not. And then we've got this risk index, which is a more the grey area in between, which is the this composite. People just not. 

Speaker 1 

Tell perfect it helps a ton. No, and thank you for and this is again, This is why it's so awesome to work with you all. But so you can. My language was wrong. It's should be thinking about exploitation and modern slavery is 1 extreme form of exploitation. But really, there's this this spectrum and that that's. Enormously helpful that that helps me in thinking about the. Yeah. OK, that's really great. So then in that case, OK, so then the, the, the, the, the population is still domestic workers in the UK, I'm. Just thinking aloud, sorry. For for that, domestic workers in the UK and then we're the the, the, the, the, the hidden population are exploited workers within. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's fine. 

Speaker 1 

Exploited domestic workers in the UK, where that exploit measuring that exploitation we do in three different ways. One is this sort of minimal one is maximal and one is this, like you said, the great chain. I love that I think. 

Speaker 2 

The Gray area. 

Speaker 1 

That's why I. Didn't even I didn't really, I didn't. Caroline. OK, good. OK. So in that case, the so, so, so the I guess the one thing I can say. And I think I said the videos. I I'm surprised at how much more confident I am in the estimates from way back when, currently they seem. I'm willing to put my name to them. They seem quite they're. They're they're, in my opinion, they're shockingly high. They're they're very consistently depending on a bunch of model parameters, but sort of 30% is a conservative estimate. So there's something like 30 to 40. 

Speaker 2 

Oh brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Percent. So the interpretation there is. Again, depending on how we think about and measure exploitation 30 to 40% of domestic workers in the UK. Are experiencing some form of exploitation and in fact I can even tell you the the maximal one I was just looking at it is. So was it? It's question 80 is the. Is the the more extreme one? Yeah. 3030.7% is the estimate with the pretty reasonable estimate of uncertainty. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so. So I think this will make our, if you like, our message much more. It sort of turns it down a bit if we talk about exploitation. If we talked about 3040% in modern slavery, that that's very dramatic and we'll we'll be a front page of the Guardian, which we don't necessarily want to be that dramatic. So I think if we talk about labour exposition, it just tones it down slightly and we're acknowledging that. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Modern slavery is an extreme form, but it's not the the sole focus of the topic, so hopefully that makes you feel a bit more comfortable about the size of the problem as well. 

Speaker 1 

It it it it does and and like I said. Thank you I. I'm I'm so glad and I don't know. Feel kind of foolish actually, because like the, the more we talk, the more I realize. Oh, actually, I'm not. I haven't actually been thinking anyway, so like this, this modern slavery versus exploitation business is is. Yeah, no, these these results make a lot of sense. I mean, they're really, really high, but they're they're consistent and. So for example, if. You look at the estimated proportion that are experiencing this extreme form of slavery. It's 12% less than the estimated proportion of those experiencing the mildest form of exploitation, which logically makes perfect sense. And the the intervals. Makes some sense. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah, that that's good. So that's. So I suppose that on what we what I have done when I put the composite together was mixed up these the the dichotomous and the continuous variables. So we need to separate that out now obviously. So we have another stab at that. Celina you did you follow that? The the the logic that Scott sent through about this difference between because I've mixed up. Labour exploitation question 30. Whatever is with the other risk indicators of forced labour, I put it as a weighting at .3 and actually we can't do that well. I can't do that because it that will affect the composite variable calculation, so it won't be accurate the way the way I've currently specified it. 

Speaker 3 

I don't know which document opinion you're referring to. I know there has been the video recording from Doctor Moser and you have responded to it just before this meeting. This is so you sent me an e-mail before. 

Speaker 2 

Right. You know, this was really sort of what came out of Scott's earlier. I can't remember when we discussed it. Let me revise the composite measures and send those through to you. Well, send them through to both of you, but particularly to slim because we'll need to recalculate those composite. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Values based on the understanding that we've I've mixed up a dichotomous variable with it. Continuous risk indication. Fair report if you sent. 

Speaker 3 

Me the the document or whatever I should look at just to double check and recalculate. I can do that. 

Speaker 2 

That recalculating. No problem. Brilliant. I'm sorry it takes to work cuz it means going back and redoing. Something that we've already asked you to do, but. 

Speaker 3 

And that's part of the. Work. 

Speaker 2 

It's much clearer now. I think we're sort of learning as we go. It's heuristic. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. But so hang on, Caroline, I think I'm. About to have a second mental breakthrough for the day, so I understand the composite measure that we made is is like this weighted sum of these various indicators. But what's I missed? What why you think it? What? What's wrong with it? 

Speaker 2 

Because I've included question 36 and I've given it a slightly heavier weighting, but I've included it within the composite risk. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 1 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

So I I think I wasn't very happy when I did it and I think it's probably better if we split it up. Out. And then we then we've got this clarity about these two, the question 36 and the question 80 are clear, clearly illegal activities but at different ends of the scale, right? And the other risk factors provide a composite picture which could be indicative of forced labor. It's much cleaner if we do it that way. 

Speaker 1 

OK, I think I I think I say no. So it's not necessarily the case. That I think again. Thank you so. So I was originally thinking is that OK exploitations on a spectrum? We have these two kind of endpoints question 36 and question 80 and that the composite measure would sort of be in between these two endpoints. But if I'm understanding you, that's not really the right way to think about it we have. So that's one way to interpret. Here's the 2nd way to interpret. Yes, exploitation is on a continuum and here we have indicators for the endpoints. And then separately, we have this this continuous indicator which doesn't necessarily fit in between these two endpoints. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but it's not the case that does that make sense? It's not the case that. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, I think that's more accurate. It's separate. I think it's. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Separate. Yeah. Thank you. So. Much I tested that seriously. That was the 2nd in the last 15 minutes. You've given me two. Yeah. OK, that's very helpful. And actually that will help me in interpreting the I was a bit. Uncertain how to interpret the the estimate of the continuous indicator but but this discussion helps me a lot in in, in. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

In understanding what those results are are are saying relative to the to the dichotomous measures. So thank you. 

Speaker 2 

So. So that was I mean that. That was clear to me from your discussion about this difference between dichotomous variables and and a continuous 1, so that I think if you're happy with that approach, I think that sort of moves us forward, although it means redoing a. Bit of work. 

Speaker 1 

Perfect. And also just to be totally clear, I wasn't aware that's what I was saying. So really you you get credit for that Caroline completely. That's really no, no, that's that's that's awesome. OK, that's that's a huge clarification I do have and I don't want to hijack the conversation at all. I have sort of a big. I guess. Two medium sized questions and then some really kind of obnoxious small but technical questions if. If, if I may, if that's OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. 

Speaker 1 

So the OK, I guess maybe. OK, let me do the small ones first, so. Uh. Right. So the don't know is the deer stuff. Is fine. There's one. Nagging data issue that I still have and it's it's this business about zero, so some people I don't remember, I think I said 17 or something, a handful of people report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK. So you know they're reporting that their network size is 0. Now some of these are clearly an error because then when it comes to the referral question, can you give us the cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK? They provide one. So. So some people who say, I know zero people in the UK then provide a cell phone of a domestic worker in the UK so. So clearly those people are wrong, so I'm comfortable sort of finding them and turning their zeroes into at least one again, that's that's conservative because we know that they've reported at least one, so one. OK, so that's one issue and then two. There's still some extra zeros, some people who say no. I know zero people in. Sorry. I know zero domestic workers in the UK and I've reported zero and I don't exactly know why, but those zeros are messing up the estimators. The estimators can't handle. I'm guessing it's like a divide by zero problem or something like that where? So the question? Is. What to do with the the true zeros? Two options, one is. We just sort of. Gin it up and say let's just add one for everybody, which isn't really. I mean it solves a problem technically, but it's really really sketchy. Or to remove the the true zeros. So what to do with the true zeros is one question and then this. The easier question is. What do we think about turning the zero the the wrong zeros into ones? Are we comfortable with that? Again, we're talking about a handful of of people, but with the sample size of 97, a handful of people is not true, you know? So does that make sense? The two questions make sense. Or am I? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, no, it it does make. And I mean, I'm tempted to say take them out, but I don't know what that. Does to the. That seems because anything else is a fudge, isn't it? 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. Exactly. So what I have been doing is just adding one to everybody and just saying like, you know, just but I completely agree with you that the, the, the what it does is it it it, it does increase our uncertainty and I think it increases. A bit I don't remember exactly, but I agree with you that that sort of that's the most principled, are we OK turning the zeros into ones for people who do nominate or or make a referral or? 

Speaker 2 

Are we? Are we turning them into the number that they nominate? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 2 

So they nominated two people. We turned them into twos. Is that? And then one, did they nominate one? Is that how? 

Speaker 1 

That's right. Exactly, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

We're doing it. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. That's how we could do it, which I. I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we have. 

Speaker 1 

I'm comfortable with that myself. 

Speaker 2 

If if yeah, I think if we take out the ones that are. 

Speaker 1 

If you all are. 

Speaker 2 

Through zeroes. Don't know what the implications of that. Has for the. For how we're sampling, but I mean, if we just say that's what we've done. It's a limitation of the estimating technique really, isn't it? 

Speaker 1 

Yes, that's right. It's not a data limitation, it's not a data limitation, it's an estimation. You're 100% right? Yeah, it's it's an, it's a limitation of the estimation. That's right. 

Speaker 2 

So you have to. 

Speaker 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I think we can probably just say that. So it's. And so we've got 2, two things that we're doing then. So we're taking out. The true the ones that really are zeroes, and for the ones that. Do nominate. We're then increasing their. We we're correcting the data. 

Speaker 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

To reflect that they do know. They do have other people in their other they do have other. Domestic workers in their networks. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, exactly. And I think that's conservative, but I have to say what I mean is I think. What we're doing is we're saying, well, we know we don't know this person's degree size. We know that it's an error, and so we're assigning it a value that's the smallest possible size it could be. If you've nominated two people given 2 cell phone numbers, we know that, you know at least two. But maybe, you know, more that you just have it nominated. So by changing the 0 to a 2IN that case. That's. I think what we're doing we're underestimating that person's network size, which I think is conservative. I think what I mean is I think I think that won't inflate our our estimates. I think I should double check that though. But if if it's, I'm almost sure. But anyway, I'll have, I'll that should be my homework, but if so, then I think that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Perfectly fine, because what? We're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot, really. I mean, so whatever we find is gonna be. Yeah. Is. Yeah. I think it's gonna be fine. So because the degree set. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That's so there's sort of two, two-part solutions to that problem. So we take out the true ones and then we. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Sort of modify the data to reflect the actual sample size for the others. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Good. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, those both sound reasonable to me. Salim, do do. Steve. Does that sound OK? 

Speaker 3 

I have the similar suggestion that you have made based on the number or the amount of people they have provided the phone numbers, so we could take the amount of the phone numbers they have provided although. We have reported in the earlier question that they don't know any other domestic workers in the UK, so modifying it should should make it consistent with the other existing survey findings. 

Speaker 1 

Good. Excellent. Thank you. OK. Yeah, that's what that is excellent. So see, in increasing order of easiness. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Uh, yeah, I'm increasing order of easiness, uh. OK, I'll save this. So what we want to see, but that's at the end. Domestic worker size. So I I went back and double checked and it's it's it's it's it's true. Terms of. So the thing that we're estimating is a proportion. But to do that, one of the one of the inputs into so we have this our data and we have a bunch of parameters and all that's great. One of the inputs that's required for the estimators that I'm currently using, not for the end sum estimator, but for the the RDS estimators is a is a guess is a is a prior belief on the the the size of the population that we're sampling from. So what that means is. We ideally we would know how many domestic workers there are in the UK with the cell phone, so we know we we know the number, we know the size of the population that we're sampling from. Not enough course, not necessarily the number of those experiencing exploitation. This doesn't have to be a hard and fast number. It can be like. Well, here's my best guess. Or here's a range or whatever, whatever. But we need that number, and I've been looking. I kind of just, I thought I thought it would be easy to find. Like. On like a Labor Statistics site or something. And I I I haven't come up with a great number, one that I'm super happy with. My best guess is something like 1.7 million, which sounds a bit high, but then again there's a lot of people in the UK anyway, so if you have suggestions on where to get information on. On reliable information on the number of domestic workers in the UK in the period that we were sampling, that you all were were sampling, that would be great, would have been doing is just making up numbers and. I've just been. I've been making up numbers and sort of increasing them by orders of magnitude. So suppose there's 10,000. Suppose there's 100,000. Suppose there's a million, and seeing how, just as a very crude way, to see how, how the how those inputs affect the outputs. And the the good news is they they seem to affect the outputs not very much. So there is this is great news actually this this means it's our estimates are relatively insensitive to to the prior knowledge namely the the number of domestic workers in the UK that said at some point we'll need to settle on a number that that you know will will use I mean and of course we'll say. See Appendix for robustness. But you know for. The stuff that we report. I'll need a number. Does anyone have any thoughts on where to where I could, where to find information on on that? 

Speaker 2 

Well, the only thing that we've suggested in the past, which may not be very helpful, is the overseas domestic worker visa numbers because that is a fixed statistic that ought to relate to how many visas for a six month period because they they last for six months and then they expire and people. Have to go home. Theory. And I can't remember off the top of my head what that number was, but I think it was around 76,000. 

Speaker 1 

It sounds about right. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So if we, I mean that's my best stabber. An official statistic. I don't know if you've come across anything. 

Speaker 3 

So we have adopted, we have adopted to the most recent. 

Speaker 2 

Addition to that. 

Speaker 3 

With publishing from, I think it must also in the Guardian and it also referred guardian of times that news article and it also referred to the government UK page of UK. Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah. So they regularly publish that. So yeah, it's about 70, something 70 or 80,000 I. 

Speaker 3 

The update. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so I don't know how satisfactory that is. I haven't. I'm not familiar with the web pages you mentioned that you looked. At. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So if you if it's possible to send me the link, I could have a look. And and see if I can. If that sort of turns it into any more robust ideas. But at the moment that the only thing I can suggest which doesn't help us for the non British, sorry for the British nationals, but. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, but it's, I mean, it's fine. It's it. I mean, the the good news is like the, the the qualitative results are really, really again, surprisingly robust, so. You know, we can see here's a number that we can use and we can give a site to and say clearly this is an underestimate. Again, C appendix B for sensitivity analysis. You know I'm I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm I'm perfectly fine with that because the results are. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Again, qualitatively are really consistent, so I'm fine with that. So so no, thank you for that thing for that. OK. I've got two more. One at least one I think is a bit is a bit tricky. So I've been so you can identify three groups, 3 subgroups here. At least I I'm sure you all can probably identify more those by ethnicity. So those coming from the Philippines. Those are easy to identify. Those that come from some Spanish speaking countries. Like Bolivia, Colombia, but also Spain and. And. UK nationals who aren't. One of these. Who aren't in the first two to two categories. Is. The question is, do we want to do anything with that information in in in the following sense? In fact, Caroline you suggested we could perform estimation separately, like completely separately like like, just use this group data. Just use this data. Just use this dating at three different set the the the UK people. I mean it's. Really small so. The main interest would be on the so for the Philippines, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I wanted to get your thoughts on well. So the general question is, do we want to do anything with that information here? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Are some things we could do. Split them up into three groups, perform analysis separately, but especially between the two non UK and national groups. Question mark. If so, how comfortable are we group the Philippine one? The Philippine Group subgroup seems pretty, very straightforward, very justified to me. Are we OK? Lumping Ecuadorians with Bolivians with Spanish, you know, sort of putting all Spanish people coming from Spanish speaking countries together. When I say together, I mean. In the same subgroup. To to which we will. Perform our estimation. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

I don't know what. Sensitivities we might be and the the thing that comes to mind is Burt Burt and his class. Have you? Have you ever read a paper by Cyril Burt about? It's highly controversial racist science. And actually, he lumped people together and measured their brain size, and then concluded that. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

People in certain racial groups have smaller brains. It's got. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

I remember this. Yeah, this is. 

Speaker 2 

And. And there's been a huge critique. Obviously this paper. Yeah, and. It was depicted as racist science because people, because of the assumptions that he made when he grouped people. 

Speaker 3 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 2 

And I don't know what the sensitivities are about grouping Ecuadorians and Spanish people into some sort of larger category. And and I don't know whether that any if we did that, it would. 

Speaker 1 

I don't know either. 

Speaker 2 

Stand the test of time, or whether we might be called out in future for some sort of atrocity that we don't even know we're committing. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So I don't know about that I want is there value in doing the Filipino grouping to me as far as I can predict sounds safer, yeah. Anna, is it? Is it? Does it show any distinction? Any distinct differences from taking the I don't know. 

Speaker 1 

I I I tell take your. Point it's a thank. You. It's a very good I hadn't even thought about the sort of tested time aspect. That's a really, really good point. My wanting my, my reason for doing my reason for. Doing this is twofold. One is just very, very technical because the. The estimators that I'm using have this underlying assumption that truly in the world the social network is connected, which means that there's some path between the Ecuadorian and our sample, and the Philippine and our sample. Somebody this person knows, somebody knows somebody who knows somebody, somebody who knows this person. Fine. We don't have to make that assumption, but it makes my life a lot easier. I think there's reasons to challenge that assumption, namely by by language. For example, you might think that this, that. A group of. Philippine domestic workers are. Are are separate, are separated from other maybe, and maybe that's racist of me to say in the 1st place, but but. 

Speaker 2 

I'm not suggesting we're being racist, I'm just using that as an example, but did when he realized he was making a racist assumption when he did it. Yeah. And I think we just have to be careful if we under we, we might not understand the the assumptions we're making. Yep. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I think I think that's what I'm hearing from you is, is is maybe just. Don't subgroup. Well then the second reason I was I raised this, I wanted to separate. This is because because of these, in my opinion, relatively large estimated proportions, I was curious about heterogeneity, right, like where where are these big numbers coming from? Basically. So that was sort of a more substantive motivation and and and to answer your question. And I don't know. I haven't actually performed. I haven't done the estimation by subgroup, so I don't even know if it's anything interesting there, so maybe I should do that first, and this might be moot. I guess is, I don't know the answer to. Question, but what I'm hearing is like play it safe and don't. Maybe it's not such a good. Maybe we just leave. We leave the analysis at the. Using the entire sample all at once and justice state the assumptions and move on. 

Speaker 2 

I don't know. It's tempting. It's tempting to have a look at it. I mean, particularly for me, for the Filipino group, because we've got quite a large 2/3 of the group is Filipino. So could we somehow test? The distinction between the Filipino group and the broader sample is that that strikes me as being a sort of safe test to initially dip our toe in the water with hopefully out and not offending anybody by by means that we know that we don't understand. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. That's and like I said, that's actually on my end. That's a. That's a much easier data task because identifying that subgroup is just easier. 

Speaker 2 

Nicely, clearly delineated. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So thank you. I I I'll do that and include that my next like I said, I. We haven't. I just haven't done that analysis. But yeah, I'll do that. OK. That sounds great. OK. So the last hard question is. What do we want to present? What? What? What do you do? You want me to make tables? Do you want to make pictures? Do you want me to make P values? Like what? What do we want to? From the results, what do we want to show and how do we want to show it? I don't know if I'm being clear. I'm probably being overly vague, aren't I? So we'll have. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. Yeah, no, I think it's a really reasonable question. It's just one, I don't think that I know the answer to. So I suppose it's tied in to where we think this might be publishable and how technical a journal that is and and whether it's a journal that would require that sort of technical detail. Or if we were publishing in a more lay journal for want of a better way of putting it. Whether that would be a turn off because they just it depends, I suppose. Who's gonna review it and what are they going to expect to see? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Because we talked about various journal articles, sorry, journal outlets. We talked about the Journal of Modern Slavery, where I'm sure I don't think it would be going well. I may not be right. Then it might be going to statistical experts. In whatever technique we, we finally land on. So in in because there is quite a lot of prevalence estimation within the modern slavery literature. So there will be people who do have statistical understanding. But I think you'd also mentioned was IT pros PLOS. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Uh-huh. Uh, huh. 

Speaker 2 

And and really, I don't know anything about what their readership would expect. 

Speaker 1 

They're pretty technical, so modern slavery you're saying, is a pretty technical, or at least they have. Technical competences. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I think there is increasing interest in prevalence within the modern slavery literature. There are recognised practitioners. So I'm thinking of Clifford signs at the unit at Nork and they do a lot of prevalence estimation. They work in the modern slavery field. So I would say if I was suggesting reviewers. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Uh-huh. 

Speaker 2 

That's it's that research group that potentially I'd identifiers being a potential reviewer. 

Speaker 1 

No, I'm. I'm taking notes. Thank you. OK, so. To make my life easy, it sounds like I'll start with with. Just text, you know, point estimates, conference rules, whatever. Personally I'm I'm very very visual, so I think I think pictures are are easier to interpret for me than than than words. But but but it's also more work on my purse. It sounds like I'll start with the point estimates confidence interval. So the the, the, the, the plain Jane so to speak. But now I should say ways of present. Presentation and then we can tweak from if we need to. When we get closer to submission is it? Is that what I'm hearing is that? Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think I don't think I can add anything particularly helpful. To this conversation, and other than just trying to tailor it to whatever outlet we go for. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I I too like diagrams like that and I think Celine's already added a sort of representation of the network. So something along those lines really helps to. To make the. Hard statistics. More understandable. Yeah. So, yeah. Have have I agree with you that diagrams have great explanatory power. 

Speaker 1 

Totally the same. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. OK. OK, I'll. Good, but that sounds good. So. I'll sort of we'll. I'll start and then like if we can revisit this when we get closer to submission, but just no, that's helpful for me. That's very, very helpful for me. I think those are all my questions. Let me. Double check please. Ohh, and and you're right, I do. I haven't this there is this third approach actually of getting increasingly excited by or about that I haven't done, which is this combining the the RDS with the the. Yeah, your .7, Caroline, exactly everything I've done and we've talked about is very off the shelf, which is fine. I'm not at all. I mean, these are. This is absolutely. Proper but but there is this we initially way back when started talking about this he had this very cool idea to do in some estimation and and and talked and thought and Scott thought some more and read some more and confused himself and but yeah there is there definitely is this way to combine the two. I haven't done it. It will be manual, but I'm I'm I'm very excited by it about it because mainly for the comparison, because you know all of these RDS techniques are. Getting qualitatively the same, you know 30 to 40% depending on XYZ, whatever. But they're all this class. Of estimators are all giving. Similar, but in my opinion really high estimates, and I'm really curious to see how this sort of you know, this outsider, this outsider in some method would come. It's also cool because there's a sense. In which it's. It's it's using more information that you already have in your sample, which I think is I'm always a huge fan of. Of that. You know using all the data that you can. So I haven't done that. I don't know what your thoughts on like is that should I make that a priority is that is it is the. Is the RDS enough? Do you have any thoughts? 

Speaker 2 

It sounds really exciting. I mean it's you've got the time to do it. Yeah, well, she's always. We don't. We never have time to do anything. But if you want. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

If you find there is time, then it sounds really exciting and really interesting and that is where we started this journey trying to work out how to do nuisance so to try and if we if we can. If our data can say anything along those lines that would be really exciting to know. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I I. Agree. And even if I'm again, it depends on where we're gonna do it. It's not like. The Journal of the American Statistical Association. I mean, it's not. It's what I'm trying to say. There is a, there is a methodological innovation here. It's not huge. It's sort of. Taking this paper and taking this paper and recognizing that they have the same D and I can use that, I can put them together, but I haven't seen it done. And I think it's, I think it's a very cool idea to to combine these two and like, like you said here like since since. I mean the information's there. It's sitting in our Excel file, right? Like why not? OK, so if we're gonna do that. Then I might. Ask one piece of help from Celine or whoever, and that's to code up the bootstrapping procedure so I can do the estimator. But we'll need to estimate the uncertainty and we know how to do that. It's with the paper that actually you summarized and included Caroline in your bootstrapping doc. Uh. But we'll have to. We'll have to write that up in our. Can you do that, Salim? Or is that not something you're comfortable with? 

Speaker 3 

I I can start looking into it. 

Speaker 1 

OK, that would be. 

Speaker 3 

Great. And I will update you. 

Speaker 1 

Wonderful, the. I'll e-mail you both with the let me make note to your bootstrap it. There's a lot already written. You've got a good head start in that, like there's the paper is pretty readable. They have some supplementary information. They have some R code already. So you you. You're not starting from scratch, but it would. You will need. Well, we will need at some point to implement this for this particular method. It would be a big help to me if. I could do the estimation part and you could work on the bootstrap. Part. And then ****, and then press publish. 

Speaker 3 

Can you can you share this paper again with me? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, absolutely. I'll share the paper and the the supplemental information. There is bootstrap just making notes to myself. But yeah, that's absolutely fine and I'm glad to hear that you're excited about the sum too, Caroline, that, that that's invigorating. That's that, that, that, that, that helps. That helps me. Like I like that. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really good. I think. I think there's one thing we have missed from your from that list and your video, I don't think we've talked about #2. Which was how how we how, how we've dealt with the don't knows in the data at the moment and we perhaps need to to code them slightly differently. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. Good point. 

Speaker 2 

Perhaps as missing, I think that was your suggestion. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. And so I, I and. Please do not take any offense whatsoever. Slam your your your your recoding is is absolutely you know invaluable. But I I did change it a little bit in that. I think and please correct me if I think you had been coding. So, so, so so the issue is there's, there's, there's these different categories that one can answer, of course and. Almost always one of the answers is don't know or not. Don't prefer prefer not to say or what have you and slim you had been coding those replies as an absence of. Exploitation, however, measured in whatever type of exploitation. And. I've recorded those as just missing, so you just take those observations out again. That's a bit conservative because that because by wait is it no, it's anti conservative. So the absence of yeah. So right my bad. That's anti conservative because by removing the. By taking OK two options, people who say they don't know are not experiencing exploitation. People who say don't know are not in our analysis. Here's Salim's initial way. Here's what I what I'm suggesting now that I'm thinking about it, I think my suggested way is is is anti conservative because relatively speaking it'll look like there's more people in exploitation. Using my method in Salim's method. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

Interesting, Caroline, thanks for bringing this up. I I missed this. Yes. So the question is what do we want to do with the donos? That's exactly right. 

Speaker 2 

OK, I'm just following what you're saying about. If you take them out. 

Speaker 1 

I think that's right. 

Speaker 2 

And it makes things look. Plus. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Worse. Worse. Worse, better. Right. Right. I think that's right. Because there's. 

Speaker 2 

They had been coded as not experiencing exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, which is not really what we want to do. I suppose by nature I would be more conservative. And we don't want given that we've already got 30 to 40% of the population. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

You don't want to make it make it. Look even worse. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So we could say that we could say well, here's how we couldn't knows. And by the way that's conservative because yeah, we're because really we're making a judgment call we we just as easily could say well, no actually the don't knows are experiencing exploitation. I mean it's arbitrary right like how how, how, how so in in putting it in the not experiencing. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Exploitation. Counting them as not experiencing exploitation. Yeah, I agree with you, Caroline. It's. It's making our yeah, it's conservative because then. Our estimated proportion of those experiencing, yeah, the estimated proportion would be small. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. My apologies, Selim. I did. I you had it right all along. My bad. 

Speaker 2 

My bad. No, it's really useful clarification that so we and we're just sort of being clear about what we're doing, but it's good that we don't have to recode it, so. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. No, that's great. That's great. 

Speaker 2 

But I I I think we're erring on the side of caution, so that seems to be the right way to to be airing. Agreed. Brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

I've been trying to type up what we've agreed just on the same e-mail. The only one I haven't got anything against is 6. What do we say? Ohh the six is just a statement really. You would just your the current method you've been using for analysis and what it does. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. And so I finally sort of wrapped my head around these RDS sort of in in in a way that I should have ages ago. And I sort of I see what they're all. They're all. They're all doing the same thing and they're all just making a little bit of adjustments differently. And So what I'm thinking of doing is saying, you know, when we review the literature like, OK. Here's. These here's all these various RDS methods and yeah, they have different assumptions and we're going to do all of them, but in the appendix. And here's the one that we're gonna pick to present because. In fact, actually the one I found one even better than the s s RDS or RDSS called the model assisted. I like it better at least, but the point is we have all these sort of related methods. These RDS methods and my thinking is to just pick one. For for presentation in the main text and then say you know see Appendix whatever for for comparison and the. The the things. Really are quite different and and but again for us the numbers are virtually identical. Weirdly so. Yeah, I know, right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that means something about robustness, I think. That's my that's not rigorous, but that's sort of my. My thinking is that. Or it could mean something else, and it could mean that that whole debate and the prevalence literature is is wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles, you know is is, is doesn't really matter, it could. It could mean that the the differences in the assumptions and the the way that the different weights are calculated doesn't really matter very much is what it could mean. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

But regarding .6 is that is that are are we cool with these simply picking one for presentation purposes and then, you know, here's the Boltzmann Hoff estimator. And here's the guile assess estimator. And here's the model assisted estimator. 

Speaker 2 

Interesting. 

Speaker 1 

Blah blah, blah blah blah. Or or should we or alternatively I? Guess we could just. Pick one and and just justify it as strongly as as we can. I don't know. What do you think? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. I think we have to. We have a reason for picking the one that we picked, but that that's up to us. And I'm happy to be guided by you on that. 

Speaker 1 

That's that's very polite and very clever. If you think that's. Very good girl. But the reason I'm I'm a little bit humming hiding is is there's there's basically two that I think are sort of the clear. UM. 

Speaker 2 

From the city. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly. And and I don't really have a strong preference on either. So that's that's more homework for me, I suppose the. Yeah, yeah, well, the homework bit is is is the justification, right? Like, I've got to pick one. And so right. So two are easy to justify. Which one of the two? I mean, again at the end of the day subsequently doesn't. It's not going to matter because the all but. But you're 100, right? Like we gotta pick one to use in the main text to show the results of. To do the bootstraps for them, whatever. So that's yeah, that's that's. All right, that's on me. That's on me. Very good, very good. Thank you. Bring that up, Caroline. Again. Thank you for bringing that up. It's just you brought up a really great point. So thanks. 

Speaker 2 

Right. I think we're there. Brilliant. It's really exciting. This is a lovely conversation to have on a Friday. We should we should do more often. 

Speaker 1 

I'd love to, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And is it sensible to try and put a a provisional meeting date in the diary just in case it keeps us sort of at least talking about when they can be, even if we find nearer the time that we can't and our Friday is generally OK for everybody, I can generally do a Friday, so then you're nodding and Scott this. 

Speaker 1 

Afternoon, after it would have to be. 

Speaker 2 

Afternoon. 

Speaker 1 

Definitely. After one, uh, likely so this time is fine. Two is totally fine. But yeah, Friday after one at the earliest. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So if I pop another date in in what a months time or sooner? 

Speaker 1 

You know I would, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Then sort of three weeks, 2 weeks. 

Speaker 1 

Slim how much time do you have to? OK. Yeah. Anything's good for me. My well, once I finish marking. 

Speaker 3 

16th. 

Speaker 1 

Anything good with? Me, which should happen this weekend. So yeah, I'll have time this. So so whenever is fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry, what did you say two or three weeks? 

Speaker 3 

Which would be the 16th of February. OK, at 2:00 PM or before noon or before noon time. 

Speaker 2 

OK, 2:00 PM. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's put that in and we'll see what happens when we get there. And we can always tickle it out if we need to. But yeah, that's super. 

Speaker 3 

So for my tasks, before we end conversation, I will do that coding up for the bootstrapping. And Doctor Moser, you said you would share that paper with me and some information for what I should do and how I do it. And Caroline, you mentioned earlier something about checking or rechecking the the composite measures. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, yeah. Recalculating the composite measure. I'll send you A1. Pager of what I think now ought to be in it. 

Speaker 3 

OK, this would be helpful. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I'll try and do that as soon as I can, which probably means I have to try and do it this afternoon and then we'll. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK then. 

Speaker 2 

And then, yeah, if you can just recalculate risk variable 2. If we keep the original, but we we try another column with the revised composite. And then we haven't lost anything. But I think at the moment it's wrong as it stands for, for how we're conceptualizing the data. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Thanks everyone. It's really nice to see you all and and and and happy 2024. So all right, we'll e-mail and talk soon. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. Yeah. Good to see you shot. Yeah, I'll. I'll send the out. The points of the note that I made. So we've all got a copy. Brilliant. 

Speaker 1 

Thanks everyone. Talk to you later. 

Speaker 3 

Thank you. Hi. 

 So I guess just a quick update on my end, so I've been, things are coming along, things
are coming along, but it's just, I just need a lot of electrons, so I just have these big
runs is what's going on right now, so I have a preferred model and then I have like 50,
alternative models for robustness, shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all
the electrons, so that's sort of chugging along. I'm almost done, but haven't finished implementing
the Fihan and Solvnik. How can I, yeah. The insum, the insum, so I'm almost done with that.
They, I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to
re-learn it. There's, so I'm doing that and then when I do that, then we'll get an estimate and do
the bootstraps and that's, I think that'll be pretty neat. There's one weird thing about the data
that I discovered, there's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry, before I get there,
I did subset it by just the people who identified as Philippine O and the estimates are about the
same, they're slightly higher, it's something like 47%, depending on how you measure exploitation,
so, but they're about the same, but slightly higher and I haven't done anything else on that,
the data. So, there are two weird sources of errors. The one is, is these, these true zeros,
remember we talked about from a while ago, so people could say that they don't know any, but
okay, sorry, two other things, I should make notes to myself so I can pop size.
You want to record it, Scott? That's okay, I'm, I take furious notes. Record it somewhere, yeah.
But you feel, I don't object, please feel free to if you want to the
pop size. Oh, so you could, people have reported that they know zero domestic workers in the UK
with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone, so that's, we fixed that up, that's fine.
And then there was another one, which is really weird, which is where they, the number of people
they reported knowing, Q13 I'm pretty sure is the one, I know these things are stuck in my head
now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than the, the,
the number of people they recruit, where recruiting is determined by the node one,
node two, the network structure. So that's really weird. I don't, that one took me a while to sort
of, and it's two people, but those two people really, really messed me up. So, so I fixed that.
So, so now we have a new personal degree size, which is the max of all of those.
So it's, it's the max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the
number of people that you recruit as given by the network structure. And like I said, the last one
sort of a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not,
I'm not super worried about it. And then we have these things this thing, we have these suspicious,
suspicious variable. So we can, we can, what I'm trying to say is like, we can, we can remove
the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat. And that's, that's, that's fine. Okay.
So that's that implementing the FIHAN. And so that's just electricity at this point, like it's
just, it's, it's done. And again, the estimates are very, very, very consistent between 30 and 40
percent, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me, that's shockingly high, but it's,
it's very consistent. So in some I'm working on the bootstrap is working. And I'm almost done with
the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff. So we need the, the size of the frame.
So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year.
We needed that for the, the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that.
The preferred number, thanks to you, Caroline, 980,000, I think, something like that came from
Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah. And again, I've found it out. I use,
I use sample frame sizes from 10,000, 100,000, not in the 980,000, 1.5 million, just again,
for robustness. I should probably add, because I think one of the, I don't know what was called,
I drew it down, the, there are these two occupational classes that you used Caroline from.
And, and one of them was like spot on. And then the other one was sort of, was plausible. But
so what I'm trying to say is I should, I should use, so currently the preferred model uses the
sum of those two numbers. But I should, I should, wait, and that's fine. I'm happy to report that
and everything. But again, for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated
whatever. So that's, that's, that's for me to do. Now, the probalters. So we need to know this,
I only have one, and that's the number of people, you know, who have been referred to
the National Referral Mechanism, or whatever it's called, NRM. So we have that question.
And we, thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people in the UK, like we know the size
of that group. And so, I'm sorry, I'm rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two
population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame, which we needed from before.
And there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the in sum, we also need the
size of these probalter groups. So I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. And it
just sort of, just sort of adds some complexity to, it adds noise really to these estimators. So I
haven't done that. That's going to be more electrons, more electrons to use. So right,
probalter group, that was the other pop size. And I told you about the weird, this thing with the
people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry, I don't know how to count. And that's
where I'm at. So sorry, I didn't, again, sorry, I was coding furiously, hoping I could get it done
before three, but then I thought I didn't know how to read my calendar. So sorry about that. So,
so that's sort of the update on my end. Data is
I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress. And I
suppose the question is, what do you need from us? So I think, I think we're good to
electrons. That's fine. I think we're ready for venue discussion, where we want to submit it.
And Slim, were we able to, did the Zoteros references work for you? I don't know. I sent
it. It did. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So basically, so what I'm trying to say, I think, I think we're,
we're into like, once, while my batch is running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you
know, writing up the results, conclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like, yeah.
Okay, that's fantastic. So in terms of journal targets, I mean, the question is, I suppose,
within the business school, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list.
With ABS? Sorry. If I can, Association of Business School, Journal Quality List,
the school signs up to the Dora principles that it's not all about journal destination,
but it is a factor. So one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal target is
that list. Okay. But I tend to publish anywhere that, so I have not really been following the rules
very strictly. And I don't know what your publication targets might look like. And so I'm
quite happy to be ecumenical about this, and not necessarily pick a journal off that list,
just because that's what you're supposed to do. But, but having said that, there is one journal
potentially, which is a three star journal. So it's not an absolute top quality, but it's
a rectangle called Work Employment and Society, which has a strong theoretical basis. So I don't
know whether, well, that would mean that I would need to do some background work on,
they definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's sort of sociologically focused.
And the advantage is one of the editor-in-chiefs is actually Marek,
Causes Inksteed, who is, yeah, who's obviously at the business school. So I could sound him out
and just say, would you accept a sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated
paper in the domestic workers sphere? Is that something that you think might fall within this
scope of the journal? So that was the target that sort of occurred to me, but I'm very open to
publishing where it would suit you, Scott. I mean, I think the ABS list is a great place to start.
Because I know nothing about this, this field at all. But it sounds like, I mean,
yeah, more stars is better in general for me. But at the same time, like I'm not,
like you, Caroline, like I'm not, I'm not picky about these things. But, you know,
my general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down the tears as the rejection
ladder just come, come in, which in my case, they, they fill up my mailbox. So that would be,
yeah, so I mean, ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are sort of appropriate for, you know,
labor, domestic work, UK, human rights, whatever, and start there and yeah, work our way down would be,
I guess one of the things I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important
is, so the strategy I just articulated is, is a lengthy process. So, so I guess we should talk
about timeline. Are there are people going in for promotion or jobs or other, are there,
is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or?
I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know, how
does that sound for you? Yeah, again, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm okay taking time and doing the, the
start high. And when's the next, do we know when the ref cycle ends? I don't, I don't know. When is it?
Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's ref 2029 now. But when the actual
ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline for paper submissions is, I don't know, but I mean
24, we've got a few, we've got enough time to try a higher journal and then knock down to it. So
we, I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars. If you think we'd like to
start with that. That would be my preference, if that's it. If, if there's, yeah, that would be
my preference. I'd like, I'd like you, I don't, I don't have time constraints. Somewhere like the
British Journal of Management. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view,
a bit of a quantitative bias. So that might work in our favor. And I can have a bit of a
search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But I mean,
the fact that it's UK statistics might be quite appropriate for them. We just,
we just might need to sort of cite it in their literature to sort of see what debates they're,
they're talking about. So that's a bit of work for me to do. And then, yeah, see what I mean,
I asked our Dean and Alex to our terms about this. And he suggested research policy
and science. Okay. Neither of those journals I know anything about. I did look at the
aims and scope and to me, didn't seem to fit. But that was his initial suggestion. I don't know
if you know anything about science. Science is absolutely top. But yeah, it's a strange
fit. I wouldn't, I think of them as doing more like biology kinds of stuff. I mean,
basically, what they do is like really, really high profile stuff, regardless of field. And so
maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is high profile, maybe. But yeah,
it's said to be as an odd, as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you.
Yeah. I've heard of you. Do you know anything about research policy?
No, but I think policy sounds like a good, a good class of journals to maybe target.
Although we don't really have any policy implications currently, but, but that could,
that could be strengthened perhaps. Yeah, that brings to mind another journal called Millbank
Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're
A, B, B, S. That's possible from a policy point of view, but maybe British Journal of Management
is better. Excellent. Yeah. So, and then I suppose work, employment and society, if we fail with
BJM, it's like the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. Good. Excellent. Excellent.
That's great. That's great. That's great. That sounds all right. Sounds great for me.
So if I do a bit of a literature search, the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until
April. That's fine. And I've got seminar weeks coming up. So, and my diary is absolutely chock
block. So the, the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days, I think I could perhaps spend
some time. Actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well. So
I can do, make a start on that then. And then, so at least get you sort of some indication and
yeah, but we, I think British Journal of Management does seem to be quite a good fit. And that's,
that's a good journal. Excellent. If we get into that. Let's, let's start there. Let's start there.
I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week, because like you, the next two to
three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff. But I'm,
reading week has been good and I'm making, so I'm going to make a push to try to get, you know,
the results done. Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team. It's
really, really, really, really great. It's been fantastic working with the both of you. So thank
you. Yeah, so it'd be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah,
if we were to aim to do that for the summer, is that too, is that all right? I think by the time
we sort of tidied everything up. Yeah. And then, yeah. Yeah, June, I think it was a good target.
And July, if we get, if we miss, you know, I think that's a, I think it's very feasible as well.
I mean, like I said, the right sort of April, we'll, we'll be able to come back to it and polish and
then, you know, yeah. And I'm hoping next term might be quite as bad as this term. I'll have a
little bit, it'll be just marking then. Just marking. It just never ends. It just never ends. So
but okay, this is great. I'm going to, I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll, I'll email you
with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the, I'm not expecting any
surprise. So the RDS stuff is done, done. And then the insum, I don't know. I'm not expecting to be
surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. Fantastic. Really, really good. Was there anything from you
Selene that you wanted to share with us? I have two points. First, Dr. Moser, do you have anything
that you need from my side other than the sort of references? Is there anything else? That's it.
And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We started with BigBot. You may have
seen my email that I don't want to be included in the publication for this research. What do you
think about that? I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your, to your PhD advisor, Dr.
Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need, if you want to stay in academia, you need publications.
And in the past, you've mentioned sort of wanting to fortify your quantitative
credentials. And this would certainly help with that. I mean, I think I understand his point.
If I'm not saying this point, it's something like branding, like you don't want to get labeled as
something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just, you need publications
and full stop. So, I wasn't from Dr. Randall. I have to say it's not from Dr. Randall. It's from
the mentor in the US when I spent time there, because I'm still having meetings with the professor
there. And I see he is also the Dean of the department for international relations and politics.
And recently we had another meeting and he told me it would be not good if I have a profile
that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that. And I,
and I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I don't include my name.
I mean, it's one, it's your decision. And of course, I completely, I completely respect that. And
I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was Dr. Randall. You might run by him then in that
case, get his opinion, because he's a proper IR theory person and see what, have you discussed it
with him? No, we'll meet on Tuesday. So I will brace this up then. Okay. Because I was saying
to Celine, we could perhaps acknowledge him. If he's so sure that he doesn't want to be included
in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I just wanted to perhaps it was an Indian idiosyncrasy of the
American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would just caution you to find out, Celine,
whether it's in a matter he's talking from an American's perspective.
When that the same applies in Europe, if that's where you want to end up.
All my supervisors are American. Dr. Mosa, Dr. Randall, also the drug supervisor.
Sorry.
Other than New Carolina.
But for sure. I mean, I think sort of the bottom line is it's your decision, of course. And
I think I can speak truthfully to say that like, you've definitely contributed a lot. And I think,
yeah, you deserve to be credited in some way. And thank you. I mean, you've done a lot to help
with the project. So yeah, thank you. Thank you too that I could learn from both of you. I still
have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will update you both after I speak to my first
supervisor, Dr. Randall. Yeah. Okay. Brilliant. Thanks then. Thanks everyone. Have a great week.
Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on email from now on?
Yeah, I think email is probably good. April. Okay. Yeah.
Right, that's super. Let's stick with that then. Thanks everyone. Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.
Bye. Bye. Bye.

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

Very quick. 

Speaker 2 

Good, good. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Hi. 

Speaker 2 

Hi. Hi, everyone. So I guess just a quick. Update on my end, so I've been. Things are coming along. Things are. Things are. Coming along, it's just. I just need a lot of. Electrons. So I just. Have these just. Big, Big runs is is what's going on right now. So I have a preferred model and then I have like 50, you know, alternative models for robustness. We'll shove it in the appendix or whatnot. That's what's taking all the electrons. So that's sort of chugging along. 

Speaker 

I'm. 

Speaker 2 

Almost done, but haven't finished implementing the the the Feehan and Saul Solnik. 

Speaker 3 

I'm going to, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

The the, the the Insum the insum. So I'm I'm almost done with that, the. I've forgotten so much, I've forgotten everything about that paper, so I'm having to relearn it. There's so I'm I'm doing that. And then when I do that, then we'll. Get an estimate and do the bootstraps and that's I think that'll be. That'll be pretty. There's one weird thing about the data that I discovered. There's several weird things about the data. Oh, sorry. Before I did there, I did subset it by just the the people who identified as Philippine. Oh, and the estimates are about the same. 

Speaker 3 

Oh yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Slightly higher it's something like 47% depending on how you measure exploitation. So but they're about the same but slightly higher. And I haven't done anything else on that the data so. There are two weird sources of of errors. The one is, is these these true zeroes? Remember we talked about from a while ago so people could say that they don't know any but. OK, sorry. Two other things. I should make. Note to myself so I can pop size. 

Speaker 3 

You want to record it, Scott? 

Speaker 2 

It's OK. I'm I I take furious notes, but. 

Speaker 3 

You've recorded it somewhere, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But you, you. You feel? I don't know. Please feel free to if you want to the. Pop size. Oh, so you could people have reported that they know zero. Domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone and then they give mobile phone so that that's we fixed that up that's fine. And then there was another one which is really weird which is where they. The number of people they reported knowing Q13, I'm pretty sure is the one I I know these things are stuck in my head now for now. So that the number of people that they report knowing is smaller than. The the the number of people they recruit. Where recruiting is determined by the node one node 2 the the the the the the network structure. So that's really weird. I I that one took me a while to sort of and the two people but those two people really, really messed me up so so I fixed that. So so now we have a new. Personal degree size, which is the Max of all of those. So it's it's the Max of the Q13, the number of mobile numbers that you actually submit and the number of people that you recruit as given by the the network structure. And like I said the the last one was from a programming perspective was a real pain, but it only affected two people. So I'm not, I'm not super worried about it and we have these things we have these suspicious. This variable so we can we can what I'm trying to say is like we can we can remove the people for whom they don't know how to count and repeat and that's that's that's fine. OK so that's that implementing the free hand and so so that's just electricity at this point like it's just it's it's done and and again the the. Estimates are very, very consistent. Between 30 and 40%, depending on how you measure exploitation. So to me that's shockingly high. But it's it's very consistent. So in some I'm I'm working on the bootstrap is working and I'm almost done with the estimator. The estimator needs some extra stuff, so we need this the size of the frame. So that would be the number of domestic workers in the UK with a mobile phone in the last year. We needed that for the the RDS stuff also. So I can just, I'm happy to just reuse that the the preferred number. Thanks to you Caroline with 980,000 I think something like that came from. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that was from the European PHS survey. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And again I've I've. Standed out I I I use. I use sample frame sizes from 10/10 thousand 100,009 to 980 thousand 1.5 million just again for robustness I should probably add because I think one of the I don't know what it was called. I threw it down the there are these two occupational. Classes that you used Caroline from and, and one of them was like spot on and then the other one was. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Was plausible, but So what I'm trying to say I should I should use. So currently the preferred model uses the sum of those two numbers, but I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Think so too? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I I should and that's fine. I'm happy to report that everything. But again for robustness, I should probably repeat with not the aggregated whatever, so that's that's. That's what I do now. The pro bolsters, so we need to know this. We only have one, and that's the number of people you know who have been referred to the national referral mechanism or whatever it's called in our in our. So we have that question. And we thanks to you, Caroline, we have the number of people. In the UK, like we, we know the size. Of that group. And so I'm trying rambling, but the issue is that basically there's two population sizes we need. One is the size of the sample frame which we needed from before, and there's some uncertainty there. So I'll have to do that. But for the end sum, we also need the size of these pro bolter groups, so I'd I'd like to do some kind of robustness on that as well. It just sort of just sort of adds. Some complexity to it adds noise really to these estimators, so I haven't done that. There's gonna be more electrons, more electrons to use. So the right pro Balter group that was the other pop size, and I told you about the weird this thing with the people who can't vote, but that got fixed up. I'm sorry. Don't know how to count. And that's where I'm at. So sorry I didn't I. Again, I'm sorry I was. Coding furiously, hoping I could get it done before 3. But then I I. I thought I I didn't know how to read my calendar, so sorry about that. So. So that's where the update on my end date is. 

Speaker 3 

I mean, that's all sounds fantastic, Scott. It sounds really, really good progress and I there's a question is what do you need from us? 

Speaker 2 

So I think I think we're we're good to. Electrons. That's fine, I think. I think we're ready for uh. Then you discussing where we want to submit it and slim were we able to did the Zotero references work for you? I don't know. I sent one good. Oh, wonderful. Excellent. So I'm trying to say I think I think we're we're into like once all my batches running, I think we're into polishing off the, the, you know, writing up the results. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that works fine. It works. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Inclusion and submitting somewhere. Yeah, like. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. OK, that sounds fantastic. So in terms of journal targets and then the question is. I suppose within the Business School, we are encouraged to submit to journals within the ABS list the it's like an association of business schools journal quality list with the the school. 

Speaker 2 

With ABS, sorry maintenance. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Signed up to the Dora principles, that it's not all about journal destination, but it is a a factor, so one of the first places to look for sort of potential journal targets. Is that list. OK. Well I tend to publish anywhere that so I have not really been following the rules very strictly and and I don't know what. Your publication targets might look like and so I'm quite happy to be ecumenical about this and not necessarily pick a journal off that list just because that's what you're supposed to do. But but having said that. There is one journal potentially, which is a three star Journal, so it's not absolutely top quality, but it's reputable called work, employment and society. 

Speaker 2 

Work with them in society, OK? 

Speaker 3 

Which has a strong theoretical basis. So I I don't know whether well that would mean that I would need to do some background work on. They definitely published studies about domestic workers. It's it's sort of sociologically focused. And and the advantage is one of the editor in chief is actually marrick causes. Who is? Yeah, who's obviously at the Business School. So I could sound him out and just say would you accept her? Sort of, how would you view a sort of statistically orientated paper in the domestic works? 

Speaker 2 

I got them, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Is that something that you think might fall within the scope of the journal? So that that was the target that sort of occurred to me. But I'm very open to publishing where it would suit you, Scott. 

Speaker 2 

I mean I I think the ABS list is a great place to start because I know nothing about this this field at at all. But it sounds like, I mean, yeah, more more stars is better in general for for for me, but but at the same time like I'm not like you, Caroline. Like I'm not. I'm not picky about these things. But you know. My general thought is sort of start high and then move down, move down to yours as the rejection letter just come in, which in my case they they fill up my mailbox so that would be yeah. So I mean ABS look at the sort of best ranked that are. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Appropriate for, you know, labor domestic work. You pay human rights, whatever and start there and yeah, and work our way down would be I guess one other thing I hadn't thought about, which is important, could be potentially important is. So the strategy I. Just. Articulated is. Is A is a lengthy process so. So I guess we should talk about timeline. Are there are people going for promotion or jobs or other are there are is there pressure to publish at a certain sooner rather than later or? 

Speaker 3 

I think as long as it's in this ref for me personally, that's fine. I don't know how does that sound for you. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Again, I'm. I'm. I'm, I'm. I'm OK taking time and doing the the start high. And when's the next do we know when the rough cycle ends? I don't I don't know when is it. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's been moved out a year, hasn't it? So it's REF 2029 now, but when the actual. Not ref 2028. So, but when the actual deadline is for paper submissions is I don't know. But I mean 24, we're we've got a few. We've got enough time to try a higher journal. Yeah. And then knock down to it. So I can have a look at the ABS list and look at possible four stars if you think we'd like to start with that. 

Speaker 2 

That would be my preference if that's. If if there's. 

Speaker 3 

Right. OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that would be my preference. I I like like you. I don't. I don't have time constraints. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Well, I mean, there's somewhere like the British Journal of. That's a very highly regarded journal does have, in my view, a bit of a quantitative bias, so that might work in our favor and I can have a bit of a search around and see what they've published in the field of domestic work. But it, I mean, the fact that it's UK statistics. Might be quite appropriate for them. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

We just, we just might might need to sort of cite it in their literature. To to sort of see what debates they're they're talking about. So that that's a bit of. Work for me to do. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

And and then, yeah, see what I mean? I asked our Dean and Alex talked about this associating and and he suggested research policy and science. OK, neither of those journals. I know anything about. I did look at the. The. Aims and scope and to me. Didn't seem to fit, but that was his initial suggestion. I don't know if you know anything about science that's an American. 

Speaker 2 

Science is absolutely tough, but I did. Yeah, it's a strange fit. I would. I would, I think of them as doing more like biology, kinds of stuff. Basically what they do is like really, really. 

Speaker 3 

You wouldn't say that. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

High profile stuff. Regardless of field and so maybe that's why he suggested it to the extent that our paper is is is high profile maybe. But yeah, it strikes me as an odd as an odd suggestion, to be honest with you, I've heard of. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Yeah. I you don't think about research policy? 

Speaker 2 

No, but I think policy sounds like a good a good class of journals to maybe target, although we don't really. Have any policy implications? Currently but but. 

Speaker 3 

But could that could be strengthened? Perhaps. Yeah, that that brings to mind. Another journal called Milbank Quarterly. Have you heard of them? I don't know what rating they are, but I would guess they're AB BS. That's possible from a policy point of view. But maybe British Journal of Management is better. 

Speaker 

Excellent. 

Speaker 3 

That's yeah. So and then, I suppose work, employment and society. If we fail with BJM is like at the next, the next tier down, but still respectable. 

Speaker 2 

Perfect. Good, excellent. Excellent. That's great. That's great. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

Does that sound all right? 

Speaker 2 

Sounds great for me. 

Speaker 3 

So if I do a bit of a a literature search that the problem is I'm going to struggle to do that until April and I've got seminar weeks coming up so and my diary is absolutely chock block. So the beginning of April, I've got a couple of days I think I could perhaps spend some time. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine. 

Speaker 3 

And actually, I've got one day next week carved out for research as well, so. I can do make a start on that. Then. And then so at least get you sort of some indication and? Yeah, but we I think this general management does seem to be quite a good fit and that's that's a good journal. If we get into that. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. Let's let's start there. Let's start there. I'm going to make a push to get the results done by next week because like you, the. The next two to three weeks are just going to be quite hellish for me in terms of teaching stuff, but reading week has been good and I'm making so I I'm gonna make a push to try to get, you know. The the results done. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. I mean, it's just been so fantastic having you on the team's gone. It's really, really, really, really great, so. 

Speaker 2 

It's been fantastic working with both of you, so thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So it would be fantastic to get, get something drafted and submitted. And yeah, if we were to aim to do that for the summer, yeah. Is that too? No. Is that alright? I think by the time we sort of tidied everything up. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yep, I. 

Speaker 3 

And and then. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, June, I think is a good target and July would be good if we miss. You know, I think that's that's I think it's very feasible as well. I mean like I said the. 

Speaker 3 

And. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Right. So if April will will? Be able to come back to it and Polish and then you know. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I'm hoping next term won't be quite as bad as this term, but I'll have a little bit. We'll be just marking that. 

Speaker 2 

The finance or registered for you? 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. 

Speaker 2 

It doesn't end. It just never ends. It just. Never ends so. But OK, this is great. I'm going to I'm going to get back to my electrons and I'll e-mail you with probably just like a draft of results at some point. But you know the I'm not expecting any surprise. So the RDS stuff is done done and then the. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes. 

Speaker 2 

Some. I don't know. I'm. I'm. I'm not expecting to be surprised, but we'll see. So we'll see. 

Speaker 3 

To see. Fantastic. Really. Really good that you wanted to. 

Speaker 1 

I have two. 

Speaker 3 

This. 

Speaker 1 

Two points. First, Doctor Moser, do you have anything that you need from my side other than to sort your references? Is there anything else? 

Speaker 2 

That's. 

Speaker 1 

And the second point is I already spoke with Caroline. We start with speak bot. You may have seen my e-mail that I don't want to be included in the publication for for this research. What do you think about them? 

Speaker 2 

I I strongly disagree, but I also completely defer to your to your PhD advisor to Doctor Randall. I mean, in my opinion, you need if you wanna stay academic, you need publications and and in the past you've mentioned sort of wanting to. Fortify your quantitative credentials and this would certainly help with that. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I I mean I I think I understand his point. I understand his point. It's something like branding. Like you don't want to get labeled as something that you're not. But like I said, in my opinion, you just you need publications and full stop. So I I. 

Speaker 1 

That one from Doctor Randall. I have to say it's not from Doctor. It's from the mentor in the in the US. When I spent time there because I'm still having meetings with the professor there and he is also the Dean of the Department for International Relations and Politics. And recently we had another meeting. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. I see. 

Speaker 1 

And he told me. It would be not good if I have a profile that shows that I'm not someone from IR. And I feel a bit worried about that and I. And I'm trying to be careful. That's why I think it's better if I. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but I mean it it. 

Speaker 1 

Don't include my name is Risa. 

Speaker 2 

It one it's your decision. And of course I completely I completely respect that. And I'm sorry for assuming presumptuously that it was doctor little you you might run by him then in that case get his opinion because he's, you know proper IR theory person and. 

Speaker 1 

That that's funny. 

Speaker 2 

And see what have you. Have you discussed it with him? 

Speaker 1 

No, we'll meet on Tuesday, so I will raise this up then. OK. 

Speaker 3 

Hmm. But I was saying to silly. We could perhaps acknowledge him in if if he's if he's sure that he doesn't want to be included in the authorship. But yeah, yeah, I I just wanna. But perhaps it was an idiosyncrasy of the American tenure system. I mean, that's what I would. 

Speaker 

Of course. 

Speaker 3 

Just caution you to find out, Celine, whether it's an he's talking from an American perspective with that. The same applies in Europe if that's where you want to. To end up. 

Speaker 1 

All my supervisors are American thing to do is protect people other than you, Caroline. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry. But but yeah, for sure. I mean I think sort of the the bottom line is is it's your decision of course. And I think I can speak truthfully to say that like you've definitely contributed a lot and I I I think you, yeah, you deserve to be credited in, in in some way and and thank you. I mean you've you've done. You've you've done a lot to to to help with the project, so. Yeah. So thank you. 

Speaker 1 

Take you too, that I could learn from both of you, and I still have to learn a lot. I understand that. But I will. I will update you both after I speak to my first supervisor, doctor and. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, OK. Brilliant. Thanks. Then. Yeah. Do we need another date? Do we need another meeting date in or are we happy to do it on the e-mail from now on? 

Speaker 2 

Thanks everyone. Have a great weekend. Yeah, I think he most probably good April was probably, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. OK, right. That's super. Let let's stick with that then. Thanks very much. Bye bye bye. 

Speaker 2 

Thanks everyone. Have a great weekend. Bye bye. 

 I can't. I came on last Saturday. Okay.
Hello.
Good afternoon, everybody. How are you?
Good.
Hi. Good to see you.
And you.
Yeah, go ahead, please, Caroline. I'm not prepared.
Yeah, I was going to say, thank you for your email. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking.
It's just a way of trying to keep an aid memoir, isn't it?
Of where we're up to with this, really. So it was really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought.
Yeah, I think so.
We might have a path forward from what you're saying.
Yeah, honestly, that sounds really good.
I had to write everything down because I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that email.
Yeah. No, I'll keep talking while you're looking for it.
Please, thank you.
And interestingly, the Norck paper that you mentioned in it, I think that that is the first of two studies that they've done.
Okay. And we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I shared with you was the second study they've done a cohort study.
So now we've got both. So that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional, but we've tried to track down both reports.
Small world, yeah.
But I think we know what they're publishing anyway, and that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the Gile, is it Gile?
Yeah.
But I will read that. And that will be useful for just putting the literature related to RDS together.
Yeah, I think so.
And Selim has done a fantastic job, I think, in actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started.
So I think we've made some pretty good progress this week.
Good.
So I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings.
Yes.
Like that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the email, Scott?
Or do you want to chat with them?
Chat about the risk assessment?
Yeah, if you don't mind, please do. I'm so sorry. Yeah, so sorry, please, please.
Now, we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then.
Right.
So what I tried to do, Selim, as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right, but there are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally.
And Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning weight so that overall they would add up to one.
That's effectively an index of no exploitation through to every form of exploitation we could think of.
And we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there may be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process.
But from what you're saying in your emails, Selim, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation.
Yeah, that's right. So I have gone through these steps that you have sent me in your email last Friday, and they all, 97 people, you know, so we have some level of exploitation.
And if you go to the Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night, you can see when you go to the column, some categories, so you can see that 0.366, 0.2, 0.1, and that continues.
And as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13 categories that we have asked our respondents.
Yeah, so the question that I had, and forgive me if I misunderstood this, but we, when we put the measures together, there were some that were sort of composite measures.
So there were the 13 sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement, where there were two or three together.
So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding, Selim, or have you just done a sort of all or nothing coding?
I've done all or nothing coding. So is this the, I mean, I didn't attend last week the meeting. Is this a complication then?
Well, this is, I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this input.
I mean, definitely, you've answered the first question was how many people in the sample experienced any form of exploitation and we know.
Because of the way we've selected organisations to approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation, and not just generic people working in the sector.
So that I think is good for our clarity of our method.
And I suppose the question is, could we, or do we want to, do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got?
Because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've designed the measures is just purely a cumulative sum.
But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub-totals almost.
I have a question for Scott in terms of what we can do when we run.
I'm sorry.
How you, how you sort of conceptualise the risk index?
First cup of coffee, so apologies to all, but I'm not exactly, so I see there's what 13 categories, is that right? Some number of categories.
13 categories, and saline's, for each person, saline's indicated the extent to which they fit in that category.
And the categories in the Word document are, oh I see, the categories aren't individual questions, they're compilations of questions.
Is that correct?
In some cases.
In some cases.
It's not always, we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have.
Okay, and then, so sorry, give me a second.
So Saline, how did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet?
So Caroline sent me the email, I think you have been also included in the same email, so I'm just, I think I'm just sharing it, this will solidify the communication.
Can you see that?
Yeah, that's exactly what I have, yeah.
Yeah, so I, so going back to the question, let's start here.
For example, this would be category one, yeah, category one, and we have our question, and for that question we have more answers in this survey.
We don't have only yes, always, often, or sometimes there's also no, never, and so on.
So, but as long as they answer one of these responses, they have been forced to do work against their will.
Right.
Back to the question.
And that will be done, weighted with 0.25.
Yeah.
What do you mean weighted by 0.25?
So it's like 0.25 times 0.025.
0.025.
So that's a proportion of the total index of one. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk, so that there was a sort of cumulative effect.
So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding, silly correctly, when you look at risk category one, silly, that was designed to be those two questions together.
Yeah.
And you see, because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability.
Yeah.
So that would give you a composite weighting.
So if you answered the first question, and in any of those responses, you get 0.25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further 0.25.
Just make 0.05.
Yeah.
Yeah, just what I have done.
Yeah.
So as Karen and I said, we have your two questions.
And if the respondent, our respondent has responded for both of these questions, then they will get a weighting for each 0.025.
And some of this would be, for this question, 0.05. And that continues.
So for all questions, so here, for example, would be, again, 0.05. Here we have, again, two questions.
So it will be 0.025, 0.025.
If they have been part of that indicator for exploitation, then they will get a weighting of 0.05.
And this goes back to the beginning.
So Caroline has let weighting for all our questions in a way that is first 0.35, 0.55.
And at the bottom is also 0.10.
So in total, this makes them one.
Yeah.
So that's what I sort of entered from our conversation last week, Scott.
Yeah.
That's what I creatively designed.
Gotcha.
Thank you.
I'm hoping that I've interpreted it properly.
Right.
And then, yes, and then the, I don't know what you want to cook.
So hang on.
So it's category one.
So I don't want to, I don't know how to describe this to the different.
So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't.
And I just want to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you, you've selected those weights, not 0.35 for category 13.
Yeah.
And you've done that on a qualitatively done on the basis of the extent to which you did indicate exploitation, serious exploitation.
So that we've got the middle block that saline's got on the screen where those are all indicators of forced labor risk.
And there's a sort of cumulative effect.
So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk.
And so I've allowed, there were about 11 of those indicators.
So it just made sense sort of mathematics or arithmetic lead to get a total of 0.55.
By assigning this, these smaller weights to each composite measure.
In addition to that, we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is a more objective measure of exploitation, because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that person is experiencing exploitation.
So we've only got one question on that.
But actually that's a stronger indicator because it applied. It's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that 0.35 on its own.
So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing exploit.
One, which is this, I wanted a point one.
So this is payment below the national living wage.
So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be, it could be a exploitation, but it isn't always.
So that's why I've waited at a lower level.
So I could make a narrative argument for why I put those weightings in.
But there's some convenience in making sure that they will add up to one.
Yeah.
But there is some sort of logic behind it.
Yeah, that's great.
So then just few more questions if I can.
So the.
So category 12 is this is like you were saying is like the suggestive, but not definitive indicator.
But it gets a weight of not point one, which is twice the weight of say, category 11.
Right.
So why that confuses me is if it's if if if category 12 is the loosest, wouldn't we down weight it relative to the other categories.
With the other indicator, it can be illegal.
I suppose this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially illegal exploitation.
That's true.
It's true.
Okay.
Whereas excessive overtime.
Yeah.
Not necessarily illegal.
Okay.
I agree it's arguable.
No, no, but I just, it's fine.
It's fine.
I'm understanding all the, all the, the, the not point fives and sorry, not point not fives.
Excuse me.
And so, so all the category, no, that's not true.
All the categories in the middle block get not point not five.
Yeah.
11 indicators of forced labor and for each indicator, it's not point 05.
And that's where the not point five five comes from is because you're okay.
Good.
And in category 13, it's, it's weighted, it stated it's weighted at not point three five,
but it's also stated it's weighted at not point four.
No, it is, isn't it?
That's true.
Which one of those is wrong?
So, which one did you use?
Did you use the point three five?
I've done that.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's a typo.
That's no problem.
That's no problem.
That's great.
Thank you.
So thank you.
So now I understand this.
So, so now, now I'm able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is,
if I'm understanding it, do you, do you want to combine categories?
Is that what you're, so for example, we have, um, go, sorry, sorry.
I think Salim's done it.
I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these
13 categories.
I'm right on time.
Salim, you have done it that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we have to get the questions, the indica, the quite, yeah, which is the indicators
into those questions.
Good.
Okay.
And we're I'm totally comfortable with that.
Is that is, do we need any other aggregation category?
Sorry.
Sorry.
I apologize to interrupt.
Caroline, do you mean death on the sum category?
No, I'm happy with exactly.
I, I'm, I'm happy with what you've done.
I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures,
but we do.
So that's perfect.
Good.
Okay.
Good. Okay. I'm happy with that. If you all are, I think that's, I think that's great.
Good. Good. So, and then for each of these, we get, there's some distribution of this risk, which is great. No problem. Good. Good.
And there's no, there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level. Is there, so for example, combine categories. That's what I understood your question to be Caroline.
But now I see, I'm mistaken. That's not what you were saying. So, sorry.
You mean if there was evidence of low payment and forced labor and NRM. I mean, we've got that in the summation, haven't we?
Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just, you would just, if you wanted higher levels of irrigation, you just add up those categories on their own. Yep. Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good.
Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it. So that's great.
Yeah, in a week as well. So thank you Salim.
Yeah. Well done. Well done.
I've done it. I've done it. Yes.
It's, it's, it looks great. Like I said, this is totally spot on or looking for.
I was seeing Caroline have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. It's weight with 0.4. So I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.35.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sorry. That's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't.
I just have to change whoever is written 0.04 to 0.35 and then just take everything together. It shouldn't take long.
And it's only category 13. So it's, it's, yeah, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be too bad.
It will impact some category.
Yeah, that's right. Category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great. Good. Good. Good.
I still can't find the email. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to, well, I gotta get more coffee. Sorry.
Okay. Okay.
See if I can share my screen.
Thanks.
Yeah, we can see it.
Can you see it? Yeah.
So we've talked about the papers and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that.
Right. So I started playing around. So one, so the, the trimming. So, yeah, so boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee.
Okay. On point one, there's, there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So,
RDS, the, usually what's done is your, your sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz, but everybody in your sample is, is, is in the population.
And the objective is to calculate the size. It's a size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a, I mean, there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit.
And one of them is, and I don't know why they came up with this because, but it's great for us is, is a proportion estimate.
So you could say, okay, here's this, here's this hidden populace. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population.
And you want to know something about covariate. So for example, you want to know the HIV status among IV drug users.
So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you want to know, you want to know a proportion that are HIV positive say.
So the point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us, it's, are you exposed? So here's take one, take one is there's some indicator, or there's 12 indicators, whatever.
And we, so what I'm trying to say is, is the, the, if we consider our popular, our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being,
are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside, not withstanding, but as a way, then off the shelf methods, we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have, have this trait that are experiencing
the NMS. So why is that sneaky? That's sneaky. So that's straightforward we can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame that we think are experiencing this.
So it's, it's kind of a clever statistical trick where my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually want to know the answer to, and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer, but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in.
I think, I think this kind of fits in that category. So, so I take it as good news though, like I said, I mean, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is, is different from us than the RDS world is we, we have extra we have based on other sources we have
estimates, I think, of, like, for example, the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think, if so, then we can do, I mean, estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear but if so then we could, I'm trying to say we could, we could, we could, we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward,
very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone, then we can, we can, we can gin up a size estimate.
That's pretty cool, I think, so that's, that's, that's one thing. And that requires like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon, like, well, yeah, I could do that this afternoon requires very, very little, little, little work. I mean, like I said,
the uncertainty estimates is going to be a bear, but we'll have to figure that that that's that. Now the risk. Actually, I progress since I wrote this email.
So what I've been describing it is there's, there's like a zero one, your, your, your HIV positive or you're not, but turns out that the same methods actually apply for continuous variable so we can do exactly the same thing with the risk index.
Here the news is not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what, what's the quantity of interest here because so normally we were what we're going to know the size of such and such but with the risk index is that we don't, I don't think
and correct me if I'm wrong, we don't care about like the total.
We don't want a number, we don't want like the sum of everyone's risk indexes. I don't think I think instead of what we want is a distribution we want to know in the population how is this risk distributed are there lots of people with high value, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So that that would be ideally what we want. And I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that they'll give us numbers and confidence intervals.
So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is lots of these you're going to hate me.
So lots of these RDS methods that have been playing with our, our, our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything anybody if not no problem.
Not much.
Absolutely no problem. So, so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistics. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or confidence interval or whatever you can do hypothesis testing.
Great, go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics called Bayesian in which Bayesian say, well, so let me put it differently. So in the frequencies world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population.
We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great.
And Bayesian say, no, there's no six things. Truth doesn't exist. There's only belief and data. And I, the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should adjust your beliefs in the presence of data.
Okay, so why do I, why am I prattling prattling on about this. I'm prattling on about this because in the Bayesian world, what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing.
What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval, it's a shape.
It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in the, in our world, it would be not a size of the hidden population would be a distribution of how hard of our beliefs about the size of the hidden population.
I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. Okay, it's really weird. I mean, it's a very, they're two very, very different ways of thinking about the world and learning from data, basically.
Is it a sort of variability graph? Is that what you would produce?
What you would produce is, is a distribution saying for each value, how likely, how, how confident are we, the analyst, that the size of the hidden population is 8,500.
There's some, there's some belief, there's some probability that we have that the, the size of the hidden population is 8,500 people.
And there's some belief or some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9,500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every, for everything.
Okay. So, so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out a distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions.
So the treacherous bit is we, if we use these Bayesian methods to this RDS risk thing, what we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the, not a, not a distribution of the risk indices,
but a distribution for our beliefs about the total, the sum of the risk indices.
So that's what I'm saying is a little treacherous. Like we, it's a bit like before, we could force a distribution, but it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in.
It's like, it's kind of like the difference between a distribution, a sample distribution, like, so you've got a bunch of X's and you can plot those, or you could plot sample means.
You could take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not, and they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing.
And so, so that's, that's what I'm proposing is sort of a, is like that is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not.
I'm kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a, there's one more paper I need to read to before I rule out the, but, but I mean, I think, I mean, I think, I think I see what we need and I don't, I'm not aware of methods that do that because we want essentially we want, we want a different
network than features of the network that people usually study. Right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always prevalence, size, what have you, and we that's fine, but we want other features of, of the network, like the distribution of this continuous
covariate across across the network.
It's like a one step removed like the mean is as a measure of the song or population, then the belief is a measure of confidence.
I'm not really expressing it very well.
And so that's what exactly, exactly. And that's why it's treacherous because we get the, we get the, we get distribution, but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses the variables whose distribution we do want to come up with this thing.
So, I don't really know it's like I said, it's, it's a bit of mental gymnastics and at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one, there's one other paper I need to check.
Bear with me in that work distribution.
And please correct me if I'm wrong.
If you've either, you know, anything about, you know, Caroline last week he corrected me when I was, and that was wonderful or two weeks ago, whatever it was, but that was great. So, so hopefully I'm.
So anyway, so, so, so point two is kind of a mix, I guess I don't really don't really know what to make of point two.
Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward Dubona has this idea of Poe, doesn't he? And to me this seems like a Poe.
What's Poe?
Poe, it's a, it's a, well, I think about it as a possibility. It could be, this could be possible, but we're sort of holding it up as a possibility rather than a definite something that we know we can do.
So it's an opportunity to engage in this case in discussion.
Oh, I see. I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right.
I don't remember what point three was if there was a point three. I don't. Sorry, I don't remember.
Let me see if I can scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see my screen.
Oh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you.
Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it. Again, I've made some, I've made more progress since I wrote this email, but they're, yeah, they keep,
laptop, yeah, keep crashing. So I've had to switch a bit, but I'm making some progress on that, which is, which is, which is good. Oh, right. And then four, right, right. So then,
so I'm, I'm, I'm, I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two, and, and three is sort of ongoing, which is, which is great.
But then, you know, there's a sense in which this is all we've sort of strayed in a sense, and this is not a criticism of anybody.
This is not a criticism of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. Sorry.
Oh, that was great. Yeah. Lovely. Friday.
Apologies for that.
We sort of strayed in the following sense, at least when I started working with you all, which is awesome.
We're working from the, within the in some literature and trying to use G some and Feehan and all this and, and we've totally straight away from that right this is we're not the techniques that we're describing here don't don't don't scale anything up.
And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data. And, you know, we have the possible.
We could do scale up it's just we don't have this representative sample and that so we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the those. So normally, non random sampling, sort of, how do I say this,
the concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But, but here that's not the case the, the, the, the sampling.
The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people for who are if you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers and other people, then,
it makes sense that your, your, your, your estimate of the count is going to be is going to be off. Okay. Right. So what, so what.
So I was thinking, like, well, okay, we can do one, two and three, but we're sort of relieved. Yeah, we've straight from the flock from the, we've straight from the initial, and we're sort of leaving a lot of juicy information on the table so there's there's
any way that we can, that we can do this and this is where I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this but I think there's a way that I think we can.
So, so what I'm trying to say is, I think we can combine the two. So I think I see how, again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear but the idea is basically you use the ideas from RDS to create to
to use the ideas of RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection.
And I tried to write down the details at least enough that would remind me of where to go in the in the future but it's, it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the fian and Saul and sort of gluing them together and praying.
Absolutely fantastic.
We'll see.
But yeah, I think things were trying to circle in a way.
This is what we were hoping that we would start with start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because this won't work because this won't.
And now, possibly, there's a glimmer.
And I mean, another nice, I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree is that what I'm proposing here is, we'll get, you know, oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see
if is their consistency is there not is there because we will have all these different methods, you know, to throw at this problem and personally I think that's a, I think it's informative.
Either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates that's reassuring a certain sense. And if they don't that's informative that's telling you something about about this so I think, you know, that opinion is not universal
and is not without the tractors but I'm, I'm, I think, I think that's on balance I think that's good news so that's my report, which isn't really really exciting so that that's fantastic if we think that we might be able to circle back to real estate
using some of the end to sell great. Yeah, that's great. That's that's the idea. That's the idea. Yeah, I mean, yeah, let me say I'll try it out the, I'll try it out. I'll try it out.
Yeah.
And I suppose our, our ground our foundation is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so even if this more advanced work doesn't reveal what we want it to we've got a
Yeah, and we're talking about originally about that, what we really wanted was some sort of estimate for this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. Yeah, again with the caveat which is,
I don't know if it's good or bad but it's an important caveat that the thing that we're estimating is a proportion and not account. Yeah, yeah with that with that caveat we're solid we're very, very solid.
Brilliant. Now I was reading a paper which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up.
And yeah, that's, that's great. I mean this I'm going to ask a really stupid question now.
If we have a proportion, and we have an estimator of the total population size. Can we not produce a scale up. Exactly. So that's right it's exactly so that we absolutely can't say what if we like if we want a number, we can produce a number.
There's two.
So here's a con the pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of because, you know, one sample. I mean, again, no distraction from anybody is anything but more information the better so if there's other sources of of data that we can incorporate
this the pro the con is reflecting uncertainty in that world.
I have to think about, because
unless we had like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then, then there's uncertainty in that estimate and I, it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty.
If it's possible, I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee.
But yeah, exactly. If you if we, if we, if we want a number we can get a number.
Now, just be, yeah, it wouldn't be that confidence is something. Yeah, it would be tough to. Yeah, it'll just be, and we could just report that I mean we could just say look here's here's the, here's the estimate.
There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty and we can for the other and here's it would just be a front of it and say, you know, or even more straightforward.
Here's our point estimate and because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry, so I take it or leave it, you know.
Yeah, yeah.
You tell me, Caroline, from like a policy perspective or impact perspective is, I would think that a proportion would be.
I mean, I know like, at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from my home office is that at the government level they do want numbers they want counts but it.
I would think that a proportion would be of abuse.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at the moment at the moment we've just got descriptive statistics. So to have a proportion is a real step forward.
That's great. I will, yeah, I will get another couple I will do that this afternoon.
That would be fantastic. Yeah.
That's really really good. Do you need anything more from us?
I mean, you write my lecture slides for for next week, please. That's the number one thing I need.
Seriously, but that's no no well.
Celine, please just share when you get the category 13 thing fixed up which is, I'm not worried about it.
Just send it around again and I'll, I will do it after the meeting.
That's great. That's great. And shouldn't take long. No, it shouldn't and I will.
I'll do the, I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon at least I'll, I'll, I'll try to and see, see what comes out.
And then I'm afraid I'm going to have to park it again because teaching is going to be horrible.
But I think we've really made some good progress here. And I've got, I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft up.
I'm making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using. So I want to consolidate that into a draft and I can share that with you.
That's a great idea.
So that'll be a couple of weeks time.
No rush. No rush on my end.
So that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. I think we're in a position where we can start to do that.
I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think, I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really if I, I mean, I don't know this literature as well as you all do, but, but it seems like there's a possibility to make a real contribution.
I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity.
It's good. Yeah.
Yeah, really good.
Right. Well, given that you've got lectures, I'm not proposing to detain you.
Only longer than we have to. And slim was anything else from your side that we needed to cover today.
This, I mean, there's just the category 13. Yeah, that I'm sorry about that.
I have also more attention. So I will just be not the category 13 and then recalculate the sound category and then shared with suppose of you.
Yeah, is there anything else that I can help with?
Let me I'm just looking at the.
Right. No, it's as long as I've got the node one, the node two, that that's important. No, it looks like the what's weather exploitation.
You've mentioned the email.
I'm sorry.
Because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited.
Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some form of reverie. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
So they are all exploited.
Gotcha.
Right.
Which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got the note. Yep. Nope.
Right.
Oh, well, there is one of them. I think we've already covered it. And that is, what are the if I'm going to do that. Yeah, there is one very important thing.
Thank you for, thank you for that, Caroline.
It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think a set would be great, but which if I wanted to dichotomize and say, yes, you're in experiencing minor slavery. No, you're not.
What questions plural, what are you, what question should I use? And if there's one of the one question that's fine, which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM seems like a pretty gold standard.
Yeah, that's cool. So the good and the forced labor ones as well are more indicative of forced one slavery. It's that last, the point one one, which is a potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labor, not necessarily modern slavery.
So you probably exclude people who had just that indicator.
It could be exploited. It's labor exploitation, but it isn't.
It isn't modern slavery. Okay. And that's Q365B1.
And so I should use that one and the NRM.
Question mark.
Yeah, the NRM is definitely well as definitely as you can be. Yeah, yeah.
Modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. Yeah, good point. And it's a time to get anything else. Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable?
Not that I can think of, Salim. Have you got anything you want to mention?
I'm looking at the document. I don't think so. Okay, great.
Thanks for my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. Okay. Thanks. As always, everyone.
Yeah, do you want to meet next week or when do you want to catch up again?
Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so sorry.
What's the next ride, isn't it?
For the next two weeks, until the 22nd, I might be not rainbow because my annual review is coming up.
Okay.
I'm in the process of putting everything together.
Right. Okay. Now that's fine.
It might be as well to have, well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again probably at the beginning of December.
When is your annual review?
On the 28th.
28th, so the beginning of December.
29th or 29th of November.
Any day after that.
Right. Okay.
First of December.
Is that a Friday again? Yeah.
Let me find my calendar too.
Sorry about that. Fire alarm business.
Oh, okay. So we're suggesting Scott, perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the first of December.
That works. Just if you don't mind sending me a team to invite that would be great.
Yeah. And I'm 12 o'clock. Is that still a good time?
Yeah, I'm flexible. So whatever.
If another time works better for you all that's that's fine for me.
Well, Charles, all right for me. What about you, Salim?
11 or 12 this time.
Okay, let's go for 11 and I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft.
So, probably the week before, whatever stage it's in, I'll circulate it.
And then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well.
Great. Sounds great. Thanks everyone.
Right. Good. Good to speak to you.
And you all have a nice weekend.
Yeah, me too.
Talk to you later.
Thank you. Bye.

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

And I came on last Saturday. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Hello, docomo. 

Speaker 3 

Hello, good afternoon everybody. How are you? 

Speaker 2 

Hi, good to see you. 

Speaker 

And you. 

Speaker 2 

I would. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, go ahead, please. Caroline, I'm not prepared. So. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I was gonna say thank you for your e-mail. It's really useful to capture the sort of the latest stage of thinking. It's just a way of trying to keep an aide memoir, isn't it? Of of where we're up to with this, really. So it's really useful to see your thoughts, which all looked quite positive, I thought. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. 

Speaker 2 

We might, we might have a path forward. From what you're saying. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, honestly, I I had to write everything down cause I knew I'd forget in the interim. And sure enough, I have. You know, I'm frantically looking for that e-mail, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That sounds really good. Yeah. No. And I keep talking while you're looking for it. So interestingly, the Nook paper that you mentioned in it, I think that there that is the first of two studies that they've done and we've got now both references. So the one of the papers I showed with you was the second study. 

Speaker 3 

Please. Thank you. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

They should have done a cohorts study. And so now we've got. Both, so that's great. It makes our literature search look that much more professional that we've managed to track down both. 

Speaker 3 

Reports small world. Yeah, but. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think we know what we're where they're where they're publishing anyway and so that's really useful. I haven't had a chance to read the the guile. Is it guile? You pronounce her surname. But I will read that and that will be useful for just putting the literature review related to RDS together. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think so. And then. 

Speaker 2 

Selim has done a fantastic job of thinking actually getting our coding of the risk assessment variables started. So I think we've made some, some pretty good progress this week. So I, I do have one question about the risk assessment groupings. So that's sort of my query for us as a team, but I don't know, do you want to start with the e-mail, Scott? Would you want to chat with them? Chat about the risk assessment and everything? 

Speaker 3 

Still can't find it. Yeah, if you don't mind. Please do. I'm so sorry. I. Yeah, so sorry. Please. Please. 

Speaker 2 

Now we'll talk about the risk assessment groupings then, right. So what I tried to do, slim as you, I think you've managed to interpret it right. There are various composite measures that you'd included in the survey originally, and Scott and I had discussed grouping them into different risk categories and then assigning a weight so that overall they would add up to 1. So we had effectively an index of of. No exploitation through to in every form of exploitation we could think of. And and we thought at the time that we did that, that we might lose some of our sample because there might be some people who actually fell out of the exploitation category in that process. But from what you're saying in your e-mail system, everybody we've spoken to is reporting some form of exploitation. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's right. So I have, I have gone through gone through these steps that you have sent me in your e-mail last Friday and they all 97 people. You know, so you have some level of exploitation and if you go to the? Excel spreadsheet that I shared with both of you last night. You can see when you go to. The column some categories so you can see that 0.3660.20.1 and that continues so and as long as there's no 0.00, this means there is a level of exploitation happening from one of these 12 or 13. Categories that we have asked our respondents. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So the question that I had and forgive me if I. Misunderstood this, but we when we put the the measures together, there was some that were sort of composite measures. So there, there would be thirteen sort of individual indicators, but some of those were grouped into, for example, freedom of movement where there were two or three together. So I wondered if you've been able to reflect that in the coding slim or have you just done a a sort of all or nothing coding? 

Speaker 1 

I've done it all on nothing coding, so is this the? I mean I didn't. I can't. Last week the the meeting that you had, it is it's just a complication then. 

Speaker 2 

Well, this is I. I suppose this is a question for us to have a chat with Scott about whether we want to show composite measures or whether we want to just show this we've got. I mean definitely you've answered the first question was that how many people in this sample we experienced any form of exploitation and we know. Because of the way we've selected organizations. To approach these domestic workers, we have actually accessed domestic workers experiencing exploitation and not just generic. People working in the sector. So that I think. Is good for our the clarity of our method. And and I suppose the question is, could we or do we want to do we need to group some of these variables into subclasses as well as having like the overall measure that you've got, because the total will be the same, won't it? Because the way that I've. Design the measures is it is just purely A cumulative sum. But it might be useful for us to have these like slightly larger groupings, the sort of sub. Totals almost. I suppose that's a question for Scott in terms of what we can do. When we run. 

Speaker 3 

Little, I'm sorry. 

Speaker 2 

How how are you? No. How you how you sort of conceptualize the risk index? 

Speaker 3 

First cup of coffee, so apologies to all but I'm not exactly so I I see there's what 13 categories. Is that right? Some number of categories? Yeah, 13 categories and celines for each person. Celine indicated the extent to which they. Fit in that category and the categories in the Word document are. Oh, I see the the categories aren't individual questions, they're. Compilations of questions. Is that correct? 

Speaker 2 

In some cases. 

Speaker 3 

In some cases. 

Speaker 2 

It's not always we haven't always got multiple indicators, but for some of them we have. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And then? So so sorry. Give me a second. So so, so lean. How did you come up with the numbers that are in the Excel spreadsheet? 

Speaker 1 

So Caroline sent me the e-mail. I I think you have been. Also including the. Same e-mail so. I'm just. I think I'm just sharing it this slit communication. Can you see? That, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's exactly what I have. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. So I. So going back. To the question. Let's start here. For example, this would be category one, yeah? Category one and we have our question. And for that question, we have more answers in this survey. We don't have only yes, always, often or sometimes. There's also no. But and and so on so, but as long as they answer one of these. Responses they have been forced to do work against their will and back to the question, and that will be done weighted with 0.25. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, and. 

Speaker 3 

What do you mean weighted by 0.2? So it's like 0.25 times. 

Speaker 1 

0.0250.02. 

Speaker 2 

Five. So that's the proportion of the total index of 1. So I broke down one across all the categories of potential risk so that there was a sort of cumulative effect. So this is where I just want to check that I'm understanding silly correctly when you. Look at this category. One silly that was designed to be those two questions together. Yeah. Can you see because they both refer to vulnerability, abuse of vulnerability? Yeah. So. That would give you a composite weighting. So if you answered the first question and in any of those responses you get point nought, 25. And if you answered yes to the second question, you get a further point. Nought, 25, do you use the maximum? 

Speaker 1 

And this makes 0.05. Yeah, yeah, this is what I have done. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's super. So. 

Speaker 1 

As Caroline said, you have your two questions and. If the respondent our ID, our respondent has. Responded for. Responded for both of these questions. Then they will get a waiting for each 0.025 sum this would be. For this question 0.05 and that continues. So for all questions. So for here for example would be again 0.05. Here we have again. Two questions. So it will be 0.0250.025 if they have been out of that. Indicator for exploitation. Then they will get the weighting of 0.05 and this goes back. At the beginning so. Caroline has let waiting for all our questions in a way that pays 1st 0.35. Zero point. 55. And at the bottom. Is also 0.10 so. In total, this makes then one for 100% so percent. 

Speaker 2 

So that's what I sort of interrupt from our conversation last week. Scott, that's what I. Creatively designed and hoping that I've interpreted it properly. 

Speaker 3 

Gotcha. Thank you. Right. And then yes and then the the I don't want. So hang on. So it's category one category. So I don't want, I don't know how to describe this. So the different. So there's like blocks of categories and some of the blocks have the same weight and some don't and differs across and. Just to make sure I understand you, Caroline, you you've selected those weights, not .35 for for category 13 and you've done that on qualitatively done on the basis of. 

Speaker 2 

I have some. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

The extent to which. You. You. 

Speaker 2 

Which indicates exploitation, serious exploitation, so that we've got that the middle block that Celine's got on the screen where and those are all indications of forced labour risk. And there's a sort of cumulative effect. So if you see more than one indicator, then potentially there's greater risk. 

Speaker 3 

Right it it. 

Speaker 2 

And so I've had allowed there were about eleven of those indicators. So it just made sense sort of mathematic arithmetically to to get a total of .55 those. 

Speaker 3 

Thanks for waiting, waiting. I think it's it. 

Speaker 2 

By assigning this these smaller weights to each composite measure, then in addition to. That we've got this issue about whether people have been referred to the NRM, which if you like is more objective measure of exploitation because somebody other than the self, the person themselves has made an assessment that that, that person is experiencing expectation. So we've only got one question on that. It's actually that's a stronger indicator because it a flight, it's somebody else's assessment. So I've given that .35 on its own. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

So you could have all these self reported indicators of risk and have been referred, which would then give you a pretty strong indicator that you have been experiencing explain. One which is this A which is at .1. So this is payment below the national living wage. So that's not necessarily forced labor or modern slavery, but it could be. It could be a exploitation, but it isn't always right. So that's why I've waited it at a. Lower level so. I could make a a narrative argument for why I've I've put those weightings in, but there's some convenience in making sure that they all add up to one, but there is some sort of a logic behind it. 

Speaker 3 

Just fine. Yeah. No, that makes. Yeah, that's great. So then just a few more follow up questions if I can. So the the. So category 12 is this is like you're saying, is like the suggestive. But not definitive indicator, but it gets a weight of not .1. Which is twice the weight of say category 11. 

Speaker 2 

It is. 

Speaker 3 

Right. Why that confuses me is is if it's if if if if category the 12 is the. Loosest, wouldn't we? Down. Weight it relative to the other categories. 

Speaker 2 

And with the other indicator, it can be illegal. I suppose that this this issue about not getting the national minimum wage is it's actually an potentially an illegal exploitation. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. OK, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Whereas excessive overtime. It's not necessarily illegal, I I agree, it's arguable. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

No, no. But I just, it's fine. It's fine. I just want. To make sure I'm understanding all the all the the. The not point fives and and sorry not point, not fives. Excuse me? And so so all the category. No, that's not true. All the categories in the middle block get not point not 5. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So there are 11 indicators of force labor and for each indicator, it's nought point nought, 5. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's where the not .55 comes from is because you're OK, good. Just one other question then in category 13. It's it's weighted, it's stated it's weighted at not .35, but it's also stated it's weighted at. Not .4. 

Speaker 2 

No, it is, isn't it? That's true. So one of those is wrong. So then which one did you use? Did you use the .35? 

Speaker 1 

I've done that with 0.35. 

Speaker 3 

OK, that's fine. That's fine. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So that's that's in typo. 

Speaker 3 

That's no problem. That's no problem. That's great. OK. No, no. So thank you. So now I understand this. So. 

Speaker 2 

My bad, OK. 

Speaker 3 

So now I'm. Able to at least try to process Caroline's question, which is if I'm understanding it, do you do you want to combine categories? Is that what you're so? For example, we have? No, I said. Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

I think kilian's done it. I think the answer is that he has combined them because he's combined them into these 13 categories. I'm right, aren't I? Celine? You have done it that way. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you can mind the questions. The yeah, which is. 

Speaker 2 

The indicators into third question. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. And we're, I'm. I'm totally comfortable with that is that? Do we need any other aggregation? 

Speaker 1 

Some some category. Sorry. I apologize to interrupt, but Caroline, do you mean that one the same category? 

Speaker 2 

Now I'm happy with exactly I'm I'm happy with what you've done. I just wanted to check that we had the sub indicators in the composite measures, but we do. So that's perfect. 

Speaker 3 

Good. OK. I'm. I'm, I'm. Happy with that if if you all are, I think that's I think that's great. Good, good. So and then for each of these we get, there's some distribution of this risk which is. Great, no problem. Good. Good. And there's no there's no suggestion to like aggregate to a higher level is is there so. So for example combined categories, that's what I understood your question to be, Caroline. But now I say I I'm mistaken, that's not what you were saying. So sorry. 

Speaker 2 

Ah, OK. You mean if there was? Evidence of low payment and forced labour and NRN. I mean we've got that in the. Summation, haven't we? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, you're right. All the information's there. You could just you would just if you wanted higher levels of validation you would just add up those categories on their own. Yep, Yep. You're right. You're right. You're right. Got it. Good. Awesome. Thanks very much, Salim. This is the data that we need and you have provided it, so that's great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. In a week as well. So thank you, Celine. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, well done. Well done. 

Speaker 1 

I've done it yesterday. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it's it's it looks great. It's like. I said this. Is totally spot on. We're we're looking for. 

Speaker 1 

What I'm seeing, Carla, I have to go back and correct. I didn't weigh it with 0.35. Its weight was 0.4, so I would have to calculate these some category again by changing it to 0.3. 

Speaker 2 

Five. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Sorry, that's that's my mistake. I was playing around with the weightings and I didn't and obviously. 

Speaker 1 

I I'm saying so. Probably try. I just have to change whatever. Is written 0.040.35. And then just. Take everything together. This shouldn't take long, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And it's only category 13, so it's it's. Yeah, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't. Be too bad. 

Speaker 1 

It will impact some category but it. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's right, category 13 and the sum. That's right. That's all. Excellent. Great, good, good. I still can't find the e-mail. Do you mind sharing your screen, Caroline or Salim or somebody to? I get more coffee, sorry. 

Speaker 2 

OK. See if I can. And my screen. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we can't see. 

Speaker 3 

All right. 

Speaker 2 

It can. You see it? Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

N7 OK, papers right. Good. 

Speaker 2 

So we talked about the papers and and thank you for the RDS papers. Well, I will read that. 

Speaker 3 

That's. That's cool, right? So I started playing around so one so the the trimming so. Yeah. So uh boy, how do I start? I start by drinking more coffee. OK, on on .1. There's there's something sneaky we can do. There's a bit of a cheat. So uhm. So. So in RDS the usually what's done is you're you're sampling from the hidden population, but with convenience and snowball and all this jazz. But everybody and your sample is is. Is in the in population and the objective is to calculate the size. Is the size estimation. So our setting is a little different, but there's sort of a I mean there's a ton of tools in the RDS toolkit and one of them is. This, and I don't know why they came up with this because but it's it's great for us is is a proportion estimate. So you could say, OK, here's this here's this hidden populate. So we're in the classical RDS world, which says everyone is in a hidden population and you want to know something about covariant. So for example you wanna know the HIV status among. IV drug users. So IV drug users is your hidden population. You can do an RDS, but you wanna know you wanna know proportion that are HIV positive say so. The point is there's some dichotomous variable that you can sample. So for us it's are you exposed so to to take one take one is there's some indicator. Where there's 12 indicators, whatever. And we So what I'm trying to say is is the. If we consider our hidden population to be the set of domestic workers in the UK with a cell phone and the covariate of interest being, have you 01 have? Are you experiencing modern slavery? Yes or no? Again, all the operationalization issues aside notwithstanding, but there's a way then. Off the shelf methods we can use to calculate the proportion of people in our frame that have this trait that are experiencing mass. So why is that sneaky that sneaky? So that's straightforward. We can do, but the sneaky bit is that it doesn't give us a number. It tells us the proportion of people in our sampling frame. That we think are experiencing this. So it's kind of clever statistical trick where it might my opinion of statisticians is that they take questions that you actually know the. Answer to and turn them into questions that statisticians can actually answer but aren't necessarily questions that you're interested in, and I think this kind of fits in. That category so. So I take it as good news though. Like I said, one other sneaky thing we could do, which is different from us than the RDS world is we. We have ex. We have based on other sources, we have estimates I think. Of like for example the size of domestic workers in the UK, I think if so then we can do I mean estimate uncertainty is going to be a bear. But if so then we could. I'm trying to say is we could we could force a number if we wanted to, we can get a proportion using very straightforward very proper methods. If we have an estimate for the size of. Domestic workers in the UK with the cell phone. Then we can we can. We can gin up a size estimate, so that's pretty cool. I think so. That's that's one thing. And that requires, like, I mean, I could do that this afternoon. Well, yeah, I could do that. This. Afternoon requires very little. Little little work. I mean, like I said, uncertainty estimates is going to be a bare, but we'll have to figure out that now the risk actually progress since I wrote this e-mail. So really I've been describing it is there's there's like a 01 your, your your HIV positive or you're not. But it turns out that the same methods actually applies for continuous variables. So we can do exactly the same thing with the Risk Index now. Here the news is. Not as good and a little bit treacherous. So I was thinking about this, what's the quantity of interest here? Because so normally we were what we want to know the size of section size, but with the risk index, we don't, I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, we don't. Care about like the total. We don't want a number. We don't want, like the sum of everyone's risk indices. I don't think I think. Instead what we want is the distribution. We want to know in the population. How is this risk distributed? Are there lots of people if I value, etc. Etcetera. So that would be ideally what we'd want and I'm not aware of RDS methods that will do that. They'll give us numbers and confidence intervals. So that's not great. Now here's the treacherous bit is. Lots of these. You're gonna hate me. So lots of these RDS methods that I've been playing. With our our. Our Bayesian methods. Does that mean anything to anybody if? Not no problem. Bayesian so. 

Speaker 2 

Not much. I heard the term, but I don't know that. 

Speaker 3 

I am absolutely no problem. So so here's the here's Bayesian versus all the statistics that you probably wherever it's called frequent statistic. So the idea there is you get an estimate and you get a standard error or conference interval or whatever you can. Do hypothesis testing. Great, go. There's a whole other way of doing statistics. Like Bayesian, in which? Bayesian, say. Well, so let me put it in. So in the frequentist world, there is truth. There is some true size of this hidden population. We just don't know it. And our goal is to our challenge is to estimate it based on data that we get somehow great. The bayesians say no, there's no such thing as truth. Doesn't exist. There's only belief and data, and I the good Reverend Bayes can tell you how you should. Adjust your beliefs in the presence of data. OK, so why do I? What am I addling on about this? I'm adding on about this because in the Bayesian world what you get out isn't an estimate and a confidence interval and hypothesis testing. What you get out is modified beliefs and modified beliefs are represented as distributions. So what you get out of a Bayesian analysis isn't a number and a confidence interval. It's a shape. It's a posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. So in in our world it would be not a size of the hidden population, it would be a distribution of how. Of our beliefs about the size of. The hidden population. That makes sense. 

Speaker 2 

I've written it down. I'm thinking about it. 

Speaker 3 

OK. It's it's really weird. I mean it's a very there are two very, very different ways of thinking about. The world and learning from data, basically. 

Speaker 2 

So is it a sort of? A variability graph is that what you would produce. 

Speaker 3 

What you would produce is is a distribution saying for each. Value. How likely? How confident are we the analyst? That the the size of the hidden population is 8500. There's some. There's some belief there's some probability that we have that the the size of hidden population is 8500 people, and there's some belief there's some probability that the size of the hidden population is 9500 people. That's some other number and so on and so forth for every for everything. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So so why is this somewhat treacherous? This is somewhat treacherous because this is a way of getting out of distribution when these RDS methods don't really produce distributions, so the tractor split is we. If we use these Bayesian method. Leads to this RDS risk thing. What we would get out is a distribution, but not a distribution, but not a distribution for the not a distribution of the risk indices, but a distribution. For our beliefs. About the total, the sum of the risk indices. So it's saying a little treacherous, like it's a bit like before we could force a distribution, but it's it's not exactly the distribution that we're interested in. It's like the it's kind of like the difference between a sample distribution. So you've got a bunch of X's. And you can plot. Those or you could plot sample means, so take a bunch of samples, calculate a mean for each one and plot those. So those are two different distributions, but they're different. They're not, they're not. And they both come from the variable X, but they're definitely not the same thing. And so that's that's what I'm proposing is sort of. Is like. That is very similar to the difference between that I just described. So again, I don't know if that's useful or not. I was kind of disappointed to see that there wasn't a there's one more paper I. Need to read. To before I ruled out the the. But but I mean, I think it's, I mean I think I think I see what we need and and I don't I'm not aware of methods that that do that. We want essentially we want, we want a different feature of the network than features of the network that people usually study, right. People usually study things like maybe degree distribution, but almost always, yeah. Prevalence size, what have you and that's fine. But we want other features of the network like. The distribution of this continuous covariant across across the network. 

Speaker 2 

It's sort of like a one step removed, like the mean is as as a measure of the. Some or population. Then the belief is a measure of confidence and I'm not really expressing. 

Speaker 3 

Is that the? 

Speaker 2 

It very well. 

Speaker 3 

No, no, you got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. You got it exactly right. And so that's exactly exactly that's why it's treacherous. Cause we get the we get the we get distribution but it's not exactly the distribution that we want, but it kind of uses. The variables whose. Distribution, we do want to come up with this thing, so. I don't really know. Like I said, it's it's a bit of mental gymnastics. And at the end of the day, I don't know how useful that would be. But let me write that down. I do need one. There's one other paper I need to check. Bear with me in network distribution. And please correct me if I'm wrong. If either you know anything about, you know Caroline, last week he corrected me when it was. And that was wonderful. Or two weeks ago, whatever it was. But that was great. So. So hopefully I'm. So anyway, so so so .2 is kind of a mix I guess. I don't really. I don't really know what to make of. .2 and I don't remember what point. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I put it down as a possibility. I think Edward de Bono has this idea of. Poe doesn't he and to? Me this seems like a. Poe, like Poe, it's a it's a. 

Speaker 3 

Wait, what's the code? 

Speaker 2 

Well, I I think about it as a a possibility. It could be it could be possible, but we we're sort of holding. It up as a. A possibility rather than a definite something that we know. We can do. So it's an opportunity to engage in this Bayesian discussion. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh I see, I see. I understand. I'm sorry. I see. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't remember. What .3 was, if there was a .3? I don't. Sorry I don't remember. 

Speaker 2 

Let me see if I can Scroll down a bit further for you. I'm hoping that you can see. My screen properly. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yeah, it's perfect. It's absolutely fine. Yeah. Thank you. Off the shelf. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's software out there. I've been playing with it again. I've made some. I've made more progress since I wrote this e-mail, but they're yeah, they keep. One of my laptop. 

Speaker 2 

I think. 

Speaker 3 

Keeps crash. Yeah, keeps crashing. So I've I've had to switch a bit, but I'm. I'm making some progress on that, which is which is, which is good, right. And then four. Right, right. So then. So I'm I'm I'm I'm. I mean, I think we're solid on points one, one and two and and three is sort of ongoing which is which is great, but then there's a sense in which. This is we sort. Of strayed, in a sense, and this is not a criticism of anybody. This is not a criticism of anybody's data, anybody's data gathering strategy. No, no, no, no, no. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh that was great. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, lovely. Friday. Apologies for that. We we sort. Of strayed in in the following sense, at least when I. Started working with you all, which again is awesome. We're working from. Within the in some literature and trying to use Gsom and Feehan and all this and and we've totally straight away from that right. The techniques that we're describing here don't scale anything up. And that's kind of unfortunate because we have all this, we have this cool data and we have the. We could do scale up. It's just we don't have this representative sample and that. So we're worried about that. And it's especially bad because the so normally. Non random sampling sort of. How do I say this? The usual concern with sampling biases are in the uncertainty estimates. But but here that's not the case. The the the, the, the. The selection mechanism affects not only the uncertainty estimates, but actually the raw counts as well, which kind of makes sense because if you are picking people. Or who? If you're picking people who scale up to bigger numbers than other people, then OK, that sort of makes sense. That your your. Your estimate of the count is gonna be is gonna be OK. Right. So what? So what? So I was thinking like, well, OK, we can do 1-2 and three, but we're sort of we're leaving. Yeah, we've, we've, we've straight from the flock from the we're straight from the initial. And we're sort. Of we're leaving a lot of juicy information on the table, so is there. Is there any way that we can do this? And this is where. I had to start writing things down because I knew for a fact I would not at all remember how to choose this, but I think there's a way that. I I think we can. So sorry, what I'm trying to say is. I think we can combine the two, so I and I think I see how. Again, uncertainty is going to be a real bear, but the idea is. Basically you use the ideas from RDS to. Use the ideas of. RDS when doing the scale up to account for the non random selection. And I tried to write. Down the details, at least enough that would remind me of of of where to go in the future. But it's it's basically taking equations from the dial article and the. And and saw and sort of gluing them together and praying so again. 

Speaker 2 

For anyone else. That sounds absolutely fantastic and yeah. 

Speaker 3 

We'll see, but I think it's I. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, we sort of come full circle in a way. This is what we were hoping that we would try. We'd start off trying to do and we've sort of gone around going, no, it won't work because. 

Speaker 3 

Think it's worth trying. 

Speaker 2 

This won't work. Because this won't be and now. Possibly, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I mean another nice I I think it's a nice thing that you all might disagree. Is that what I'm proposing here is we'll get oodles of estimates, which I think is a good thing because you can sort of look across them and see is there consistency, is there not is there. You have all these different methods to throw at this problem and. Personally, I think that's a I think it's informative either way, if we have these different methods and they produce similar estimates, that's reassuring in a certain sense. And if they don't, that's informative. That's telling you something about it about this. So I think you know that opinion is not universal and is not without detractors. But I'm. I'm. I'm a I think I think that's. On balance, I think that's good news. So that's my report, which isn't. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that sounds really, really exciting. So that that's fantastic. If we think that that we might be able to circle back to real estate, Newsome using some of the and then to sell great. Yeah, that's great. 

Speaker 3 

That's that's the idea. That's the idea. I mean. Yeah, let's say I'll try it out the I'll try it out. I'll. Try it out, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And I suppose our. Our ground, our foundation, is that we can use the RDS method to get an estimate estimator so. Even if this yeah, more advanced work. Doesn't reveal what we want it to. We've got a when we're talking about originally about the what we really wanted was some sort of estimate of this. And we feel that we can now achieve that. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Again with with the caveat which. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it's an important caveat that the thing we're estimating is a proportion or not a count. But yeah, with that, with that caveat, we're we're solid. We're very, very solid. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Now I I was reading a paper which which was talking about this difference between proportion and counts. So we can include that in the write up. And and yeah, that's. That's great. I mean this, I'm. Gonna ask a really stupid question now. But if we have a proportion and we have an estimator of the total population size, can we not produce a scale up? 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. So that's right. Exactly. So we absolutely can we like if we if we want a number we can produce a number, there's two. Here's a pro. Here's a con. The Pro is we're bringing in outside information, which I'm generally a fan of. Cuz 1 sample. I mean again, there's no distraction from anybody's anything but more information the better. So if there's other sources of data that we can incorporate, that's great. That's the pro the con is. Reflecting uncertainty in that world. I'll have to think about because. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Unless we had, like a census count of domestic workers in the UK, which I don't think we do then. Then there's uncertainty in that estimate, and I it's not immediately obvious to me how how to combine those two sources of uncertainty. It's gotta be possible. I just have to sit down. I'll have to have another cup of coffee. But yeah, exactly. If if we if we want a number. 

Speaker 2 

No. OK. 

Speaker 3 

We can get a number. 

Speaker 2 

We just be. Yeah, it wouldn't be that. 

Speaker 3 

Confidence is something. Yeah. It would be tough to it. It would just be and we could just report that. I mean, we could just say, look, here's here's the estimate. There's two sources of uncertainty. We can't account for the one source of uncertainty. And we can't for the other. 

Speaker 2 

It could be that confidence in that number. 

Speaker 3 

And here's it would just be upfront about it and say or even more straightforward. Here's our point estimate. And because of data constraints, we can't produce an uncertainty estimate. Sorry. So take it or leave it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. But the and you tell me, Caroline, from, like, a policy perspective or impact perspective is I would say that a. Proportion would be. I mean, I know like at least what I hear from people like Todd and what I understand from the Home Office is that. At the government level, they they do want numbers they want. Counts but it. I would say that a proportion would be of use question mark or. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I think so, yeah, definitely. It's more than we've got at the. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Moment at the. Moment, we've just got descriptive statistics, so to have a proportion is a real step forward. 

Speaker 1 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. I can. I will. Yeah, I will get another couple. I will do that this afternoon actually. 

Speaker 2 

That would be fantastic. That. No, that's really, really good. Do you need anything? More from us, Scott at this stage. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Can you write my lecture slides for next week, please? That's the number one thing I need. Seriously with this. No. Well, just when you get to category 13 saying fixed up, which is I'm not worried about it. It's trivial. Just send it around again and I'll. 

Speaker 1 

I will. I will do it after the meeting. 

Speaker 3 

That's great. That's great. And and. Take long. No, it shouldn't. And I will. Yeah, yeah, I'll do the. I'll do the proportion stuff this afternoon, at least I'll try to and see what comes out, and then I'm afraid we have to park it again because teaching is gonna be. 

Speaker 

No, but I. 

Speaker 2 

Think we've really made some good progress here and I've got. I've been looking forward in my diary and I've got a day booked in a couple of weeks time to try and draft. Stop the I've been making notes from our discussions and some of the literature that we've been using, so I want to consolidate that into the draft and I can share that with you. So that will be in a couple of weeks time and but I've got some time, but. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. That's a great idea. Oh, no, no, no, that's no rush. No rush. On my end please. 

Speaker 2 

Time booked in so that we can start to build the argument for why we've done it this way. We're in a position where we can start to do that. 

Speaker 3 

I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but I think. I think it's very exciting. I think it's quite promising really, if I. I mean I I don't know this literature as well as they all do, but but it seems like. There's a possibility to make a real contribution, I think, which is exciting. So thanks for the opportunity. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, very. Yeah, that is good. Yeah. Yeah, really good. 

Speaker 3 

Very cool. 

Speaker 2 

Right. Well, given that you've got exercises, I'm not proposing to detain. Yeah, you don't get any longer than we have to and slim with everything. Else from your side that we needed to cover. 

Speaker 1 

Today, I mean, there's just the categories that I've not done, I have to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that. My deliberate mistake. 

Speaker 1 

I I can also pay more attention to it. So I I will. Clean up the categories 13 and then recalculate the sum category and then share it with. Dispose of you and yeah. Is there anything else that I can help with? Doctor Moser? 

Speaker 3 

Let me I'm just looking at the. Right now, as long as I've got the node one and the node 2, that's important. Now it looks like the what's weather exploitation. You've mentioned a new e-mail type of. 

Speaker 1 

Whether they have been, but whether they have because we want to exclude respondents that have not been exploited. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, this is what you're saying about how everybody has had some fame, right? Right. OK. Thank you. Thank you. So. 

Speaker 1 

By looking at that. It's that. They are all exploited some degree. 

Speaker 3 

Got you. Right, which, yeah. And you got the waves and you got. The Yep. Nope. Bye. Ohh well there is one of them. I think we've already covered it. And that is what are the. It it if I'm gonna do that? Yeah, there is one. Very important thing. Thank you for. Thank you for that, Caroline. It doesn't have to be a single question. In fact, I think book is set would be great, but which? If I wanted to dichotomize and say yes, you're in experiencing modern slavery. No, you're not. What questions? Plural, would I? What question should I use and and if there's more than one question, that's fine. Which set of questions should I use? There's the one like the NRM. Seems like a pretty gold standard. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's good. So they got and the forced labour ones as well are more indicative of forced of once slavery. It's that last the point. 11 which is it potentially illegal exploitation, but not necessarily labour? Not necessarily modern slavery, so you probably exclude people who had just that indicator, they they could be exploited. It's labour exploitation, but it isn't. It isn't modern slavery. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And that's Q 36 five B1? And so I should use that one. And the NRM. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, the only one is definitely well, as definitely as. You can be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Within our data, modern slavery, but combined with the forced labor increases the confidence. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, good point. And the 2 * 2. Anything else? Any other questions you think I should be using for this indicator variable? 

Speaker 2 

Not that I can think of. Still him. Have you got any anything you want to? Mention anything common? Use. 

Speaker 1 

I'm just. I I'm looking at the. Document I I don't think so. 

Speaker 3 

OK, great. Good. Makes my life. Thank you. That's great. Super duper. OK. Thanks. Thanks as always everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, brilliant. Do you want to meet next week or give it? When do you want to? Catch up again. 

Speaker 3 

Someone's at my door. Give me a second. I'm so. Sorry, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Are you around next Friday today? 

Speaker 1 

I for the next two weeks until the 22nd I might be not. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Because my annual review is coming up. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'm. I'm in the process of. Putting everything together. 

Speaker 2 

Right, OK, now that's fine. So it would be as well to have well, if Scott can circulate what he does statistically from this meeting and then we plan to meet again. Probably at the beginning of December, when is your annual review. 

Speaker 

I can't. 

Speaker 1 

On the 28. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

The 28th, so the beginning. Of December would be aware. 

Speaker 1 

29 or 29th of November. Any day off on that one? 

Speaker 2 

Right. OK. 

Speaker 1 

3rd of December, since it's a Friday, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Is that a Friday again? Let me find my calendar too. 

Speaker 3 

Sorry about that. Fire alarm business. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh OK, so we're suggesting Scott. Perhaps if you could circulate the results of your work this afternoon, but then we don't actually meet again until the 1st of December. 

Speaker 3 

That works just if you don't mind sending me a team invite. That would be that would be great. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, and and 12:00, is that still a good time? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I'm flexible, so whatever. If another time works better for you. All that's that's fine for me. 

Speaker 2 

That's alright for me. What about you, silly? 

Speaker 1 

11 or 12 is fine. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's go for 11, then I'll circulate an invite. And before that date, I'll circulate a draft. So we've got some probably in the week before whatever stage it's in. I'll circulate it and and then that gives us a chance to sort of have a look at that and comment on that as well. 

Speaker 1 

No. Ohh good. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

Sounds great. Thanks everyone. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, good. Good to speak to. You thank you getting fire alarm sorted out, OK. 

Speaker 3 

All have a nice weekend. Yeah, me too. Talk to you later and you. Thank you. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Have a good weekend.

Transcript 

Speaker 2 

Hi, can you hear me? 

Speaker 1 

Yes, we can hear you, yes. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. Sorry I'm late. I slipped my mind. I was at the coffee shop and then popped up. Anyway, sorry I'm late. Sorry, nice to see you all. How are you? Staying warm, I hope. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, great. How are you doing? Cause you were, I think you had a doctor's appointment last week. Are you OK? 

Speaker 2 

Health better. Thank you. Yeah, I'm cold, but I'm in marking hell for coming to the end of it. But yeah, I've been marking hell. So how are you all? 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thank you. Yes. Been doing a little bit of teaching, but just a couple of skills days for social policy. Social workers. So yeah, most of my teaching takes place next term, so I've got. I'll be buried next in semester 2. 

Speaker 3 

I'm good. 

Speaker 2 

Well, so yeah. I I'm I'm. I'm I'm I'm I'm the opposite. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm happy for you but yes, enjoy. Enjoy while you can. I haven't touched anything since we last talked, but that said it's still probably a good idea to touch base and see. What's next or what's where? Where we are just so we don't sort of get off track. Thanks a ton for the draft, I. I found the the sources and I gave it a quick read, but I haven't really done anything. I'm sorry, I've just been buried with teaching and grading so sorry. 

Speaker 1 

No, that's OK. I wanted to get it down whilst I had a day to do it. So it is. It is a first draft, it's not polished and but I thought capture some of the ideas whilst they were still fresh and I've indicated in there where I think perhaps you and Selim might be able to contribute like sections of text. So hopefully I'm not asking you to put in anything that. You're not not able and willing to contribute. 

Speaker 2 

No. Yes, of course. Thank you. I missed that though. Can you? What? What? I don't have it open. What? So I mean, obviously the the result, the methods and the results. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Yeah. So I've got some methodology down there, but there's obviously you you're closer to the detail of what you're doing. So yeah, methodology and results, that's it. And then once we've got that in and we can revisit the discuss. 

Speaker 2 

That's great. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And I've put some points down, but there will obviously be more coming out when we've got a A for the paper to work with. The other thing I'm aware that is outstanding is you'd asked us if they're given the quite high proportion that we're coming out with, whether we could just look at some simple statistics to see whether. That proportion seemed sensible and wondering Selim, have you seen that e-mail? Is that something you might be able to do? 

Speaker 3 

For us, you mean the article? 

Speaker 1 

No, the Scott's last e-mail about taking, just doing a sense check against the proportion figure that he's finding. 

Speaker 3 

No, I didn't. I I told you just now. But also for you doctor model. So I had in the last 2-3 weeks my annual review, the preparation and also the exam. That's why I didn't time with anything else. But it went well. So I passed a new review and yeah, so just update me quickly. Caroline, please. 

Speaker 1 

So I'll forward you the e-mail from Scott cause I've got it and then if you can just take it. It's not a big job, I don't think. But if you could just have a look at that and then circulate your findings. I mean Scott's very kindly indicated which questions it relates to. So it's it's literally a, a percentage, I think isn't it's got. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, the issue is just that the so we've got these like fancy schmancy techniques which are great and very preliminarily, I, I and this was weeks ago, I I I. Sup. Since then and I only had One Cup of coffee today, so this is all danger. But the the sort of where I parked it mentally is we have some initial estimates using these. These sort of next generation snowball samples, for lack of a better phrase, and that is not a very good phrase. And doing that gave some really high at least it seemed to me, really high in numbers and so. I was just thinking aloud to to to Caroline, and I'd welcome any and all inputs. Is is. Just as like, what if we don't do fancy smancy stuff and just look at the sample and just look at the the proportion in sample that we have reason to think are experiencing modern slavery? Like what is that number? I don't know that number. And whatever that number is, it's clearly not correct in the sense that we don't have random sample etc etc etc. But just as a something to compare to. The I don't remember the exact numbers. Caroline do. Do you remember? It was. It was in the thousands, though, wasn't it in? 

Speaker 1 

The well, it was a proportion that you gave us, wasn't it was sort of 30% or something. 

Speaker 2 

Is it proportionate? That's right. That's right. Yeah, which just sounds. Really high. I mean, again, is the proportion of. Of my of domestic workers who I I think, yeah, plausibly we can say even a subset of those that are that are from the Philippines or from Latin America I think because that. We're not explicitly sampling that population, but it's sort of kind of implicitly sampling that population. I think so. And so that the percentage just seemed to sound high to me, but I don't know anything about this, so. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Well, it's possible because they have no protection. And yeah, and and that's what I I think it is possible I think it, but I think it and I think it would attract interest. So it would be good to be as sure as we can about what we're saying because this seems to be quite a an interest. There's a lot of interest in this topic when. Jim and I published the preliminary report just looking at the descriptive. Sticks. We got a lot of media attention for that. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's great. 

Speaker 1 

So that was not really as exciting as what we're doing here. So I'm sure there would be continued interest from, I mean there's Jeremy Ball at East Midlands today, he's sort of following our work at the Rights lab. He always keeps an idea, an eye on what press releases we create. So he would. I'm sure pick it up again. That's great. Yeah, it is. I mean, from a an impact point of view, it's. It's great and I think there have been a couple of great literature reports I'd include ours in that, but also the Latin American Women's Rights Service has produced a report, but it's just descriptive statistics like us. So this really does move the conversation forward and I think. 

Speaker 2 

But that's great if there's if the. I'm sorry, you're. 

Speaker 1 

Good, now it says like with the change of government, if we presumably we get the change of government, then there there's a task force which is charged with looking at this issue within the first hundred days. So it's potentially got policy impact. So I think some Andrea Rain is leading something. This that a colleague at Nottingham Trent mentioned to me, so this is the sort of thing that her team would be interested in picking up as well. So it could be really timely. 

Speaker 2 

This is bent. This I really want to be done with grading and get back to this. This is really exciting. And that's what I was gonna say is the the. I wasn't aware of these. We're advocacy groups. I wasn't aware of sort of the specificity that like you mentioned, there's like a what was a Latin American women's. You know, that's great if if we can can and obviously you are connected to that, but that's that would be like you said. 

Speaker 1 

When it's right started, yes. 

Speaker 2 

That would be. Yeah, I mean, the more now we're. Having conversation and the. Once we start sort of subsetting it down the the the the proportion, the proportion sounds less unrealistic to me after this conversation, so that's very exciting. If OK, there's a big caveat. The big caveat there is. So thank you, Caroline again for the opportunity and I completely agree with you that like if we can do some quantity stuff with this, yeah, that would be, you know like way better than I did. But like that's that's a contribution. It makes you a little bit anxious because it makes me think like, OK, well, we really got to get these numbers right then because like this isn't, you know, this isn't something that. There's sort of other. It's like there's a a pool of of this kind of quantity prevalence estimation that we can sort of, you know, well we're close or we're not so close. So we differ. But here's why like it's. Pretty new, so just. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I agree. And when Bernard Silverman produced the stats, the initial stats for modern slavery in the UK, he used multiple systems estimation to do that. And he produced a statistic that was widely covered in the media and was used by policymakers. Which proved to be wildly inaccurate in the end, in that the the the situation was far worse than his estimation suggested. So I think you're just talking, you're part of the conversation, but the conversation keeps evolving. Yeah. And the estimates are literally estimates based on a technique that are not. Correct, but that are. A way of engaging people in the debate. So I think as long as we're clear about what we've done, how we've got to that, I think we're OK. 

Speaker 

That's a really. 

Speaker 2 

I think that's thank you for that, Karen. That's a really great perspective and and not one that I. Had so. So just to paraphrase, you're saying like. Well, I mean. I mean essentially like that's how science works is you, you make some mess and you do some research and then others come along and say no or I can replicate it or things have changed or whatever. And I I think I was approaching it as like kind of timidly kind of like, well, I gotta make sure this number is, you know, right or this method is really justified. And I think you're right. That's. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Sort of not. That's a luxury we don't have in this particular research domain, and that's just that's that's that, right? That's that's that's not. It's not a sin against us. That's a nice perspective. I like that. That's thank you for that, Caroline. That's a good one. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. I mean, I think it's just listening to Bernard talked about his experience and yeah, I mean, I think he said that the number of slaves were between 11 and 13,000 and then later estimates suggested up to 148,000. So I mean, that was quite a significant change in the number, but. 

Speaker 2 

Right. I just, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

His his paper started that conversation and yeah. So I think it's just viewing it as this is a contribution to the debate based on these particular methods. 

Speaker 2 

Right, right. Sounds good. OK, so when I get time when? When I'm out of marking hell. What's the what's the? What's the next step or help reorient me, please. As to what? What, what? 

Speaker 1 

Revealed that. Yeah. So I think it's trying to flesh out that draft, so I'll I can go back to it and Polish up what I've written and make sure that it cause it's not a bit less stream of consciousness and but actually it needs input from you and Celine as well to be a fully rounded piece and it's. 

Speaker 2 

I can do. 

Speaker 1 

The the skeleton is there and I suppose we also need to think a little bit. Once you've had a chance to have a look at, it's got perhaps where you think. We might target it and whether it needs. The the sort of context setting to to appeal to the audience. That's the journal that we think we. 

Speaker 

Good point. 

Speaker 1 

Want to go for? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Good. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Thank you. That's helpful. 

Speaker 1 

And I suppose there's a technical point that I've got in. My mind that a. Lot of the nomenclature is really difficult to do in Word and I think you you do understand latex, don't you? So it might be better actually to write it in latex, which I've never used. But perhaps if we can get the draft up to a certain standard, you would be able to then transfer it for us. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, absolutely. No, it's fine, actually. And there's there's. So back in the day, you're right that in. Fact one of my early collab. Craters. So I use latex and he didn't and we had this project and he early on he was. He was like we're never gonna publish this because we just we're just gonna clash. And so anyway I'm trying to say back in the day there was a real barrier but nowadays there's lots of conversions. It's really pretty straightforward to convert. So we can. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, are they OK, good. So we could still. 

Speaker 2 

We can still, we can still we still talk to each other should be. Should be OK. 

Speaker 1 

That's right. That's right. 

Speaker 2 

But yeah, that's a good point. Salem, do you mind taking a step? I don't know. What? What let review in terms of like the methods, needs, needs or is desired, but do you feel comfortable taking a stab at that so you know the? Basically, I think I've sent along at this point troll the troll, the trove of emails I've sent. I think there's A and Caroline as well. A number of papers that that address the kinds of methods that we're using, question mark. 

Speaker 3 

So I I have written down for now. And the task for Caroline to add more information and write up the methods section in the article that Caroline sent and the second task is the forwarded e-mail. So it seems there are some task I I just had a glance into it. Look into the e-mail that Caroline just now forwarded and then asked that. For you, Doctor Mose, you're asking for some information from my end, so I will look into that. And what else is there? 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, the method section of the paper I've already drafted what I can based on your annotated biographies. Yeah, so? OK, so there there is a method section there. And and then. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but it's gonna be very sharp, right? 

Speaker 1 

It's OK. I mean, the whole paper is 4000 words. Currently, I don't know quite what we're we're targeting, what length we're targeting, but I've asked you specifically if you could add the network structure graphic. You remember that we put that that actually visualizes the structure of the network. And and the way the extent to which it's constructed. Of different waves. So that was that section. That, yeah, if you could put that section in. And then I've asked, Scott, if he could include the point estimation and confidence limit estimates that have been calculated. And then. The bit that needs drafting is about in terms of the method is the data analysis which I think Scott is best placed to draft. Because you know what you've done? Not so. That's those those areas are indicated in the paper. I'll just put them in. They're indicated at the moment in just normal text. I've just put them in bold. So you'll be able to spot them a little bit easier. 

Speaker 

Thank you. That's great. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

And then obviously I'll I can Polish up the text, but I I don't want to spend too much time. Doing that until. Yeah, until we know. What the over whether it sort of hangs together as an overall narrative, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you very much, Carolina. See it. It's it's. I see what has to be done and I don't have time to do it today. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, that's the big the big problem. 

Speaker 3 

Isn't it? I could do my part. Or what the? Weekend and also in in in the beginning of next week. So I'm I'm more free. 

Speaker 2 

Now, great. Excellent. 

Speaker 1 

Is your. Did your timetable get a bit better in the new year then Scott? Is that going to be, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it it gets. It gets better until about I have one of these intensive things and and I plan to work. So things will get a lot better for me mid next week and I plan to return to research. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Fiercely then. But. Yeah, for about. Not quite a week, but essentially next week I'm. I'm yeah. Anyway, it's. I mean, I see what has to be done. I can't wait to do it. And and I'm so sorry, but I simply can't right now, right. 

Speaker 1 

No, no, that's, I mean, I completely understand the teaching is something you can't ignore. 

Speaker 2 

And and and marking is just so many and the oh so many, so many, so many. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I feel your pain. 

Speaker 2 

Will you be? I'll sadly, or I don't know. For better. So I'll. I'll probably work over parts of the break probably until late December and e-mail and what I'm trying to say is. I'll. I'll work on this likely over break and I'll probably have emails and I hope you don't read them because I hope you're with your families. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'll try not to, I must admit. But my January is not too bad. So if if we can. 

Speaker 2 

In June. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

And reconvene, perhaps in January. Does that suit you too, Celine? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I could do online because or even in person I will be flying to Germany on the 15th of January for a week, but we could also meet online. So there's. No problem. Yeah. Online or doesn't matter. 

Speaker 1 

So would it make sense just to pencil in a date for January so that we've got something to in the diary to work to? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, let's do so. Ideally before the 15th of January maybe. 

Speaker 1 

What? What? 

Speaker 2 

And then agreed. 

Speaker 1 

Do you want to pick a is Friday still going to be? Good for you, Scott. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, until teaching start, I think I don't even know my timetable for next next term, but the yeah, Fridays should be should be fine. So I I do something before the before the 15th, but after the 4th would be good for me. I think I'll. I think I'll be traveling until the 4th. So I don't know maybe. 

Speaker 3 

Add the 12th Friday the 12th June. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, the 12, what's that like? Yeah. And does this time work? 

Speaker 2 

Looks great for me. 

Speaker 1 

This, this, this a meeting at this time work. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, it works for me. 11:00 AM again. 

Speaker 2 

Great, good. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, let's put that in and then we'll see where we are. I'll just do. 

Speaker 2 

That's it. That's great. That's that's that's a great deadline and that the plan gives me enough time to. That's great. That's a great deadline for me. Thank you. That's. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

And still in if you just add your section into the current document and that's in the shared file, then we've got 1 shared copy that we're all working on. That would be great. 

Speaker 3 

We have done that before, so should. 

Speaker 

Be fine. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. We sort of know what we're doing with. That so? 

Speaker 

That's great. 

Speaker 2 

Oh yeah, since it's on the share or the OneDrive. Is that right? OK. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, it is. It's it's not in the folder that you set up those spots cause I don't seem to have access to put things in there, but it is it's. On the OneDrive. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. Thanks. 

Speaker 1 

The links in the e-mail I can resend it if you think that would be useful. 

Speaker 2 

Couldn't hurt you. Couldn't hurt. I'm sure. I'm sure I have it. But if you don't mind, that would be great. Yeah. Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

Alright, let me see if I can hunt it out. 

Speaker 2 

Or don't worry about. It I mean I I put all of our stuff in its own folder so I can just search for that folder and I'm sure I'll find it. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, we'll just see if I can find it. Here we are. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Right. I just resent the the e-mail, so that should be sort of somewhere at the top of your inbox now. 

Speaker 2 

Brilliant. Thanks a ton. Thanks a ton. Oh, good. That's great. So like I said, I like this deadline. And now I must return to marking, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Smoking. Yes, and he might need more coffee. 

Speaker 2 

I absolutely do. So please, please, please enjoy your weekend and have nice times because vicariously is the only way. I will get to enjoy it so. 

Speaker 3 

So, doctor, more than I have been told by another academic staff when I told, they told me during these two weeks of marking treaties. Now eat the candies, eat fast food, or just to treat yourself from the marking, marking stress. 

Speaker 2 

That's great. I I will thank you. That's great. I'll, I'll. I'll get a I'll get a pastry at the coffee shop as well. That's. Thank you. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Should do some fantastic. 

Speaker 1 

Guys, OK. Won't hold you anymore. Then stop. Good catch up. I'm glad you're feeling better. 

Speaker 2 

Really great to see you all and and and and. Yeah, I look forward to. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. Let's see if we can get something in the. New year. Good. See you. 

Speaker 3 

And then. I see your. 

Speaker 2 

Bye. Happy holidays, everyone. Take care. Bye. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Thank you. Bye. Bye then. 

 Yeah, all good. Thank you. Good. Just discussing the some question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns. Yeah.
It just never ends. It's just, it's just, yeah. Anyway.
We feel your pain from the previous term.
Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to college. It seems that you're in the majority of Carolina that at least among people I talked to that this term is the heavy term compared to last term.
So I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. And I'm very glad mine is over so or yeah, you know.
Yeah, so I saw your email Scott say thank you for prompting us. I think we still even I would just discussing the like a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting.
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah.
That won't really help us.
But so there are two issues that the clean data that you need to be able to do anything.
And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything.
Are those the two main issues for you?
Yes, that's exactly right. And for whatever it's worth. I feel like we're really close.
But yeah, that's that's exactly right, Caroline.
So Dr. Moses, you have sent me last time and you taught me to do that bootstrapping.
And so I also told us to Caroline. Yeah.
When we're waiting. I didn't do anything. That's okay.
When I saw your Tuesday, I said to you, I will send you something. Yeah, but I couldn't get. Yeah.
Yeah, I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person like me and you so that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together.
Yeah, I will be on Monday on campus. Would you have time then to Monday?
Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon three or four.
Can you do before 1pm or before noon?
No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1pm. I think hang on.
I can't do it 1pm until 2pm and then from 3pm until 4pm and then from 5pm until 6pm.
So I could do from 1pm until no from I could do from 2pm until 3pm.
2pm should work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that should work.
On Monday. Yeah.
Do you mind sending me a team's invite? We can meet where we can meet my office, your office, coffee.
We can meet in your office. That's fine. That's fine.
But the main thing, the most urgent thing I think is this data issues is the, I just don't understand what's, did my question make sense or am I just confused?
Which question? Yeah, exactly. Right. My question about the, about the data and the code books.
You asked something about the code book and I think the code book that I had sent in end of November, beginning of end of November, this is also the latest one.
Okay, good.
This should be the most recent updated code book that we have. Good.
And then you had also a question about the referrals to phone numbers, 10 or 5.
Yeah, it's, well, yeah, yeah, because the data, yeah, exactly.
Yeah, so for that is, in our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or 10, but we said we will only accept up to five.
Yeah, just the first thing. Okay.
Second information is, even if people have referred, let's say, seven people, five, it does mean they have been successful.
No, of course, right, of course. So that's why, in order to understand how many referrals we had eventually, we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID, and at the wave, so that we can identify which I, which person ID recruiter has successfully recruited or referred people.
I got that. And of course, really, the successful recruit referrals aren't the same as referrals, and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The issue is really just one of variables.
It looks like some people refer up to nine people, and that's, or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine.
Up to 10, yeah. But then there are these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be three phone numbers, and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number.
So on the survey, people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone, and some other people could only refer three or four people.
That doesn't explain the gap.
Let me share my screen if you don't mind, and probably easier to just look at it.
I have to figure out how to share my name screen. Let's try that. Hopefully that's working. Can you see my Excel?
Yeah.
These are great examples.
Okay, so first let me pop over to the code book, and there's no coding after Q90.
My understanding is that Q105 here, up to Q110, were the referrals that were used. So those were the coupons that were given.
And then you've got this person who refers nine people. That's fine. That makes sense. But look at this person.
This person refers three phone numbers, and then they refer six nothings, and then there's a phone number way over here.
Or take this person. Their Q105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I just don't understand how this happens.
Yeah.
So for starters, is my understanding correct that this is the possible set of phone numbers?
Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five, that we don't actually give the coupons, and that's great.
And that's actually super helpful.
But the reason I'm asking is because at our last meeting, we had this observation. I think Caroline had a great suggestion.
But there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people.
And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should fix that up. And that's right.
And then I was thinking, well, hang on. That logic applies to everybody.
So if you say you know two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give five phone numbers, that same logic applies.
And we should still fix up that number.
And so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give.
And I, like, so for this row, what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is it four?
Or can we not tell?
In that case that you have highlighted before.
Okay, good. Thank you.
Okay, that's excellent. That's what I understand. And so and likewise, so this for this row, the number would be nine.
Yeah, nine.
Okay, so basically I shouldn't worry about the or the gaps or the ordering.
I think you shouldn't worry about gaps in between the phone number referrals.
And if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the printed survey from the just system.
So you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer.
People were filled out.
Wonderful. Yes. Thank you. That's that's super wonderful.
But now even even this conversation is super helpful because now I know the the number of phone numbers that a person gave.
And that was the missing piece that I was I was.
Yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess, but but so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can.
Oh, I'm going to take this off.
And and that's great news. Thank you. I will.
How do I stop? I will.
I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff.
And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're we're we're we're virtually ready to go. Oh, oh, the population estimate. Yes, Caroline, what were your thoughts on on that?
So I've been tracking the Europeans on this and they have a category that they call personal household services PHS.
And they've started to collect data on this.
And it comprises two elements.
So there's the just jotted down the details that I found.
And they work without accommodation, which has a NAC code 88. And then they have an activities of households as employees of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97.
Now that is also a sick code for the UK, this activities. So that's very closely linked to domestic workers that second one is tightly bounded.
An analysis that included UK figures from 2017. So it's not too far away.
And it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. Yeah. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000 respectively.
The social work without accommodation is that bigger figure. And then the activities of households as employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure.
Excellent. So the paper, they've got some trends for other countries and they, I mean, I think we could make an argument that they're broadly static.
Okay, if you're saying we're not very sensitive.
Yeah.
So the question then is, for us, do we want to combine them to have this that gives you the one million figure that I think, or roughly a million, or do we want to take this smaller lower number of 51,000 that's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure
number is larger than that. It's 79,000.
So.
So hang on. I think I misread you. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000.
929,000.
Oh, wow. Okay. My mistake.
And what were the codes again? I'm sorry. NEC? I don't know this.
N-A-C-E. I don't know what it stands for. But N-A-C-E-88.
Okay.
Which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an email. So,
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.
That's all right. And N-A-C-E-97, which is this activities of households as employers of domestic personnel.
So I think that probably can now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through Eurostat and try and pull out something more recent. But if, yeah, that's what I was hoping.
I agree.
Yeah.
But that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range.
Yeah.
From we've got lower and upper limits, haven't we?
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
But perhaps is the most.
Yep. I think that's a great idea.
Conservative approach.
Yes. I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the, the, I don't know what I'm sorry. I don't know where the 1.7 million came from.
The, it's really, it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all.
I haven't played with things as small as 50, 51,000. But I will. And I think you're right. I think the range, I think we say, you know, here's the number that we're using site, site, site.
In the appendix, here's the robot, here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change. And I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said, it was like from 900 to a million to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher, like nothing changes.
So, so I, and I don't know about the lower. So I'll, but I'll play with this. So I think this is, please don't spend any more time on, I mean, please do save the citation.
We can, we can, you know, site the site the site.
I've got, yeah, I've logged it across in an email to you.
Really? What I've just told you now. So we've got, we've got the link to the numbers.
Good. Okay. Well, I can, I can get, I can get on this starting this afternoon.
Should we meet next week or if, if Selene can get the, well, that's not entirely off.
I can have, I can have everything except the in some polished by next Friday and depending on how our meeting goes on Monday, Selene. Yeah, the in some stuff might take a little longer. I don't know.
But, but, but, but the, just from the, just from this conversation, I can finish off the RDS stuff for sure.
Okay. Would a three o'clock meeting next week be all right?
Sure.
I've got something in for two.
No problem.
Already.
Yeah.
Does that work for you, Selene?
Yeah, as long as it's after afternoon is fine.
Yeah. So we said three.
Yeah, it's fine for me.
I'll send something across.
I also sent a meeting link.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so how, how do you, how should I prepare for this meeting? What are you?
Yeah.
I think you will have the knowledge already, but I will ask you just some questions, some small questions. Yeah.
And some small questions.
So that's fine.
You can guide me.
Sure.
So you don't need to prepare anything.
Just about that.
Okay. Okay.
He said, he said, okay.
All right.
All right.
Sounds good.
And thanks for, like I said, this was.
This is very helpful for me.
So thanks.
That's great.
Yeah.
No, it's just, it just is tantalizing now, isn't it?
Cause it was, I think we, we get it.
As you say, we're getting close.
So close.
It's really just, just delivering now.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean it critically, Selene.
Not at all.
And in fact, I was, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, I'm not saying anything critical.
It's just, I, I, I'm with Caroline.
Like we just, let's get it done.
Let's get it done.
We can, we can, we can do it.
So thanks.
Thanks so much.
And I hope you have.
Find some time to enjoy the weekend.
And we'll talk in a week.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Good to see you.
Thanks very much.
Bye everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn but I don't care.
Jimmie crack corn and I don't care.
My master's gone away.
That's the lyric.
Okay.
Here we go again.
Same French guy.
All right, sir.

Transcript 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, all good. Thank you. Just this lovely and the question deadlines that are approaching, you know, teaching concerns. 

Speaker 2 

Good. How are you? Good. Yeah, it just never ends. It just it's just. Yeah, yeah. Anyway. 

Speaker 3 

We we feel your pain from the previous term anyway. 

Speaker 2 

Well, it's funny that you say that because I was talking to call it, it seems that you're in the majority of Caroline. That at least among people I talked to the the this term is the heavier term compared to last term. So I'm sorry, I'm very sorry and I'm very glad mine is over. So or. Yeah, you know. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So I I saw your e-mail, Scott said. Thank you for prompting us. I think we, Celine and I were just discussing that like a plan for going forward because we haven't moved very far from our last meeting and I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about stuff that we really just have already discussed. Yeah, that won't really help us. 

Speaker 2 

Great. 

Speaker 3 

But so there are two issues. There's there's the the clean data that you need. To be able to do anything. And then there's the population estimate that you need in order to do anything. Are those the two main issues for you? 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, that's exactly right. And and for whatever it's worth, I feel like we're really close the but, but but yeah, that's that. That's exactly right. Caroline the the. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So, Doctor Moser, you have sent me last time and you. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And taught me to do that bootstrapping, and so I also. Told to Caroline. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

While we're waiting, I didn't do anything when I saw you on Tuesday, I said to you, I I will send you something Thursday, but I couldn't get. I think a good way to accelerate this would be to meet in person, like me and you. 

Speaker 2 

That's OK. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So that we can go through my questions that I have for the bootstrapping together, so I will be on Monday. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

On campus, would you have timed them to me? 

Speaker 2 

Monday. Yeah, I could do Monday afternoon. Three or four. 

Speaker 1 

Can you do before 1:00 PM or before noon? 

Speaker 2 

No, I can't do mornings. I could do 1:00 PM, I think. Hang on. No. OK, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

One 1:00 PM. I can't do it. 1:00 PM until 2:00. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then from three until 4:00, and then from 5:00 until 6:00. So I could do from 1:00 until no. From I could do from 2:00 PM until 3:00 PM. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Uh, 2:00 PM should work, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that should work. 

Speaker 1 

This Monday on like on Monday 2:00 PM. Yeah, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Do you mind sending me a a. A teams invite? We can meet where we can meet my office. Your office? Or coffee or. 

Speaker 1 

Let's meet in your office. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine. That's fine. It's the, but the the main thing, the most urgent thing, I think, is this. Data issue is the is the. I just don't understand what's. Did my question make sense or am I just confused? 

Speaker 1 

Which question? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly right. My question about the about the data and the code books. 

Speaker 1 

So you you have, you have asked some of the code and I say the code book that I had sent in end of November beginning of end of November, this is also the latest one. So this should be the most recent updated code book that we have. And then you had also a question about. 

Speaker 2 

Uh-huh. OK, good. Good. 

Speaker 1 

The the the referrals. The phone numbers? Yeah, 4:50. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it's well, yeah, because the data. Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So for that is. In our survey, people have sometimes referred more than five referrals or 10. But we said we will only accept up to five. Yeah, just the first thing. The second information is. 

Speaker 2 

Uh-huh. OK. 

Speaker 1 

Even if people have referred, let's say, seven people or five, it doesn't mean they have been successful with Pharrell. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. That's right. No, of course. Right, of course. 

Speaker 1 

So that's why in order to. And. How many referrals we had? Eventually we we would have to go back and look at the recruiter and ID and at the wave so that we can identify which I which person or ideal recruiter has successfully recruited. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. 

Speaker 1 

Will refer to people. 

Speaker 2 

You know, I I got that. And you're, of course you're right that that the the successful recruiting referrals aren't the same as referrals is and and that's fine. I'm fine with that. The the the issue is is is really just one of the variables it looks like. Some people refer up to 99 people, and that's or attempt to refer up to nine people, and that's fine. That's fine up to 10. Yeah, but then. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

There's these weird gaps. So sometimes there'll be 3 phone numbers and then no phone numbers, and then another phone number. So like. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So. Some underserved you people could write down the people that they will refer, and some people couldn't refer anyone. And some other people could only refer three or four people, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. That's right. No, but but the. 

Speaker 3 

That doesn't explain the gap talking about. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Let let me share share my screen if you don't mind, and it's probably easier to to just look at it. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, please. 

Speaker 2 

If I have to figure. Out how to share my? Screen. Let's try that. Hopefully that's working. Can you? The. Like so, so, so so, like here. This is. These are like, great examples. So I'm OK. So first, let me pop over to the code book and there, there, there is. There's no coding after Q90. My understanding is that Q 105 here. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Up to Q110 were the referrals that were used, so those were the cube coupons that were given. But then you've got this person who refers, you know, nine people. That's fine, that makes sense. But look at this person. This person refers 3 phone numbers and then. They refer 6 nothings and then they refer and then there's a phone number way over here or take this person. Their Q 105 is blank, but then they refer a ton of people. So I I just don't understand how this happens. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

So for starters. Is my understanding correct that that this? Is the possible set of phone numbers. Again, I understand that if that number is larger than five that we don't have to give the coupons, and that's great. And that's actually super helpful. But the the reason I'm asking is because our last our last meeting we had this. We we had this observation, I think Caroline had a great suggestion. I don't remember, but there's some people that say they know zero domestic workers in the UK, but then they refer people. And so we said, well, that's weird. So we should we should, we should fix that up. And that's right. And then I was thinking, well, hang on, that logic applies to everybody. So if you say, you know, two people, two domestic workers in the UK, and you give 5 phone numbers. That same logic applies, and we should still fix up that that, that number, and so that's why I'm asking is because I need to know the number of phone numbers that people give. And and I and I like so for this row. What what is the answer to that question? Is it three or is? It. Four or can we not tell? 

Speaker 1 

In in that case that you have highlighted. It would before. 

Speaker 2 

OK, good. Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

444 people. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that's excellent that I understand. And so and and likewise so this for this other number would be 9. Yeah. OK, so basically I shouldn't worry about the OR the gaps or the ordering? 

Speaker 1 

949. I think you shouldn't worry about the gaps in between the phone number referrals and if you want to understand why that is so I could send you the the printed survey from the jest system so you can also see how it was on the smartphone on the computer. So. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

That would be. 

Speaker 1 

The people were. 

Speaker 2 

That would be wonderful. Yes, thank you. That's that's super wonderful. But now even even this conversation is super helpful, because now I know the. 

Speaker 1 

Service. 

Speaker 2 

The number of phone numbers that a person gave, and that was the missing piece that I was. I was, yeah, that was the most urgent, I guess. But. But so yes, please do that and please do send me whatever you can. Oh, I'm going to take this off and and that's great news. Thank. You. I will, I will. How do I stop? I will. I can move forward with that information. So that's great. And then Monday we can meet to talk about the bootstrap stuff. And yeah, like I said, I think we're really close. I think we're we're we're we're virtually ready. Oh, the the population estimate. Yes. Caroline, what your thoughts on on that? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So I've been tracking the Europeans on this and they have a category that they call personal household services, PHS, and they've started to collect data on this. And it comprises 2 elements. So there's the I just jotted down the details that I found so they have social work without accommodation, which has an NAACP code 88, and then they have an activities of households as employers of domestic personnel, which is NAC 97 now. That is also a sick. Code for the UK this activity, so that's very closely linked to domestic workers. That second one is tightly bounded and then I found a. 

Speaker 

Hmm. 

Speaker 3 

An analysis that included UK figures from 2017, so it's not too far away and and it just sort of a snapshot in quarter three of that. And then the figures that they gave for those two NAC codes were 929,000 and 51,000. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Respectively. So the social work without accommodation is that bigger figure and then the activities of households and employers of domestic personnel is that 51,000 figure. 

Speaker 2 

Excellent. 

Speaker 3 

So the the paper they they've got some trends for other countries and they I mean I think we can make an argument that. They're broadly static. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

You're saying we're not very sensitive, so the question then is. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

For us, do we want to combine them right to have this that gives you the 1,000,000 figure that I think or roughly a million or do we want to take this smaller lower number than 51,000? That's a bit more problematic because the overseas domestic worker visa figure number is larger than that, it's 79,000. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

So. 

Speaker 2 

So I'm I think I'm surgery. So the first category was 920,000 or 92,000. 

Speaker 3 

929,000. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, wow. OK my mistake and and what were the codes again? I'm sorry, NBC, I don't know this. 

Speaker 3 

N A/C EI don't know what it stands for, but N A/C E 88 which is social work without accommodation. I've dropped you an e-mail, so you've got this. 

Speaker 2 

OK. OK. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. OK, good. 

Speaker 3 

That's right. And N A/C E 97, which is this activities households as employers of domestic personnel. 

Speaker 2 

Which is that? Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

So think that probably could now, given enough time and perseverance, perhaps go through your stat and try and pull out something more recent, but if? Yeah, I was like, yeah, I agree. Yeah. So but that gives us, I mean, you were talking about sensitivity analysis. So I suppose we could almost talk about a range. Yeah, from. We've got lower and upper limits, haven't we and? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

That, perhaps is the most. 

Speaker 2 

Yep, I think that's a great idea and. 

Speaker 3 

Conservative approach. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, I think you're 100% right. Yeah. And like I said, the uh, the, I don't know what. I'm sorry, I don't know where the 1.7 million came from, but the. It's really. It it's very insensitive, at least when the numbers get big. So like, once you hit a million, the results just don't change at all. I haven't played with things as as small as 5051 thousand, but I, I well and I think you're right. I think the I think we say you know, here's the number that we're using. 

Speaker 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 2 

Site site site in the appendix. Here's the robot. Here's the sensitivity analysis and how things change, and I'm curious to see with these new numbers what happens. But like I said. Like from 900 to 1,000,000 to 1.5 million to anything around a million or higher like nothing changes. So so I I don't know about the lower so but I'll play with this. So I think this is please don't spend any more. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2
