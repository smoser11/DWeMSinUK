@article{heckathorn_respondent-driven_1997,
	abstract = {A population is "hidden" when no sampling frame exists and public acknowledgment of membership in the population is potentially threatening. Accessing such populations is difficult because standard probability sampling methods produce low response rates and responses that lack candor. Existing procedures for sampling these populations, including snowball and other chain-referral samples, the key-informant approach, and targeted sampling, introduce well-documented biases into their samples. This paper introduces a new variant of chain-referral sampling, respondent-driven sampling, that employs a dual system of structured incentives to overcome some of the deficiencies of such samples. A theoretic analysis, drawing on both Markov-chain theory and the theory of biased networks, shows that this procedure can reduce the biases generally associated with chain-referral methods. The analysis includes a proof showing that even though sampling begins with an arbitrarily chosen set of initial subjects, as do most chain-referral samples, the composition of the ultimate sample is wholly independent of those initial subjects. The analysis also includes a theoretic specification of the conditions under which the procedure yields unbiased samples. Empirical results, based on surveys of 277 active drug injectors in Connecticut, support these conclusions. Finally, the conclusion discusses how respondent-driven sampling can improve both network sampling and ethnographic 44investigation.},

@article{goodman_snowball_1961,
	abstract = {An s stage k name snowball sampling procedure is defined as follows: A random sample of individuals is drawn from a given finite population. (The kind of random sample will be discussed later in this section.) Each individual in the sample is asked to name k different individuals in the population, where k is a specified integer; for example, each individual may be asked to name his "k best friends," or the "k individuals with whom he most frequently associates," or the "k individuals whose opinions he most frequently seeks," etc. (For the sake of simplicity, we assume throughout that an individual cannot include himself in his list of k individuals.) The individuals who were not in the random sample but were named by individuals in it form the first stage. Each of the individuals in the first stage is then asked to name k different individuals. (We assume that the question asked of the individuals in the random sample and of those in each stage is the same and that k is the same.) The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first stage but were named by individuals who were in the first stage form the second stage. Each of the individuals in the second stage is then asked to name k different individuals. The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first or second stages but were named by individuals who were in the second stage form the third stage. Each of the individuals in the third stage is then asked to name k different individuals. This procedure is continued until each of the individuals in the sth stage has been asked to name k different individuals. The data obtained using an s stage k name snowball sampling procedure can be utilized to make statistical inferences about various aspects of the relationships present in the population. The relationships present, in the hypothetical situation where each individual in the population is asked to name k different individuals, can be described by a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the members of the population, rows for the individuals naming and columns for the individuals named, where the entry θij in the ith row and jth column is 1 if the ith individual in the population includes the jth individual among the k individuals he would name, and it is 0 otherwise. While the matrix of the θ's cannot be known in general unless every individual in the population is interviewed (i.e., asked to name k different individuals), it will be possible to make statistical inferences about various aspects of this matrix from the data obtained using an s stage k name snowball sampling procedure. For example, when s = k = 1, the number, M11, of mutual relationships present in the population (i.e., the number of values i with θij = θji = 1 for some value of \$j {\textgreater} i\$) can be estimated. The methods of statistical inference applied to the data obtained from an s stage k name snowball sample will of course depend on the kind of random sample drawn as the initial step. In most of the present paper, we shall suppose that a random sample (i.e., the "zero stage" in snowball sample) is drawn so that the probability, p, that a given individual in the population will be in the sample is independent of whether a different given individual has appeared. This kind of sampling has been called binomial sampling; the specified value of p (assumed known) has been called the sampling fraction [4]. This sampling scheme might also be described by saying that a given individual is included in the sample just when a coin, which has a probability p of "heads," comes up "heads," where the tosses of the coin from individual to individual are independent. (To each individual there corresponds an independent Bernoulli trial determining whether he will or will not be included in the sample.) This sampling scheme differs in some respects from the more usual models where the sample size is fixed in advance or where the ratio of the sample size to the population size (i.e., the sample size-population size ratio) is fixed. For binomial sampling, this ratio is a random variable whose expected value is p. (The variance of this ratio approaches zero as the population becomes infinite.) In some situations (where, for example, the variance of this ratio is near zero), mathematical results obtained for binomial sampling are sometimes quite similar to results obtained using some of the more usual sampling models (see [4], [7]; compare the variance formulas in [3] and [5]); in such cases it will often not make much difference, from a practical point of view, which sampling model is utilized. (In Section 6 of the present paper some results for snowball sampling based on an initial sample of the more usual kind are obtained and compared with results presented in the earlier sections of this paper obtained for snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample.) For snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample, and with s = k = 1, so that each individual asked names just one other individual and there is just one stage beyond the initial sample, Section 2 of this paper discusses unbiased estimation of M11, the number of pairs of individuals in the population who would name each other. One of the unbiased estimators considered (among a certain specified class of estimators) has uniformly smallest variance when the population characteristics are unknown; this one is based on a sufficient statistic for a simplified summary of the data and is the only unbiased estimator of M11 based on that sufficient statistic (when the population characteristics are unknown). This estimator (when s = k = 1) has a smaller variance than a comparable minimum variance unbiased estimator computed from a larger random sample when s = 0 and k = 1 (i.e., where only the individuals in the random sample are interviewed) even where the expected number of individuals in the larger random sample (s = 0, k = 1) is equal to the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s = k = 1 (i.e., the sum of the expected number of individuals in the initial sample and the maximum expected number of individuals in the first stage). In fact, the variance of the estimator when s = 0 and k = 1 is at least twice as large as the variance of the comparable estimator when s = k = 1 even where the expected number of individuals studied when s = 0 and k = 1 is as large as the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s = k = 1. Thus, for estimating M11, the sampling scheme with s = k = 1 is preferable to the sampling scheme with s = 0 and k = 1. Furthermore, we observe that when s = k = 1 the unbiased estimator based on the simplified summary of the data having minimum variance when the population characteristics are unknown can be improved upon in cases where certain population characteristics are known, or where additional data not included in the simplified summary are available. Several improved estimators are derived and discussed. Some of the results for the special case of s = k = 1 are generalized in Sections 3 and 4 to deal with cases where s and k are any specified positive integers. In Section 5, results are presented about s stage k name snowball sampling procedures, where each individual asked to name k different individuals chooses k individuals at random from the population. (Except in Section 5, the numbers θij, which form the matrix referred to earlier, are assumed to be fixed (i.e., to be population parameters); in Section 5, they are random variables. A variable response error is not considered except in so far as Section 5 deals with an extreme case of this.) For social science literature that discusses problems related to snowball sampling, see [2], [8], and the articles they cite. This literature indicates, among other things, the importance of studying "social structure and...the relations among individuals" [2].},

@article{gile_network_2015,
	abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling is a widely used method for sampling hard-to-reach human populations by link tracing over their social networks. Inference from such data requires specialized techniques because the sampling process is both partially beyond the control of the researcher, and partially implicitly defined. Therefore, it is not generally possible to compute the sampling weights for traditional design-based inference directly, and likelihood inference requires modelling the complex sampling process. As an alternative, we introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in a design-based estimator leveraging a working network model. We derive a new class of estimators for population means and a corresponding bootstrap standard error estimator. We demonstrate improved performance compared with existing estimators, including adjustment for an initial convenience sample. We also apply the method and an extension to the estimation of the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in a high-risk population.},

@article{mccreesh_evaluation_2012,
	abstract = {Background: Respondent-driven sampling is a novel variant of link-tracing sampling for estimating the characteristics of hard-to-reach groups, such as {HIV} prevalence in sex workers. Despite its use by leading health organizations, the performance of this method in realistic situations is still largely unknown. We evaluated respondent-driven sampling by comparing estimates from a respondent-driven sampling survey with total population data. Methods: Total population data on age, tribe, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual activity, and {HIV} status were available on a population of 2402 male household heads from an open cohort in rural Uganda. A respondent-driven sampling ({RDS}) survey was carried out in this population, using current methods of sampling ({RDS} sample) and statistical inference ({RDS} estimates). Analyses were carried out for the full {RDS} sample and then repeated for the first 250 recruits (small sample). Results: We recruited 927 household heads. Full and small {RDS} samples were largely representative of the total population, but both samples underrepresented men who were younger, of higher socio-economic status, and with unknown sexual activity and {HIV} status. Respondent-driven sampling statistical inference methods failed to reduce these biases. Only 31\%---37\% (depending on method and sample size) of {RDS} estimates were closer to the true population proportions than the {RDS} sample proportions. Only 50\%---74\% of respondent-driven sampling bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals included the population proportion. Conclusions: Respondent-driven sampling produced a generally representative sample of this well-connected nonhidden population. However, current respondent-driven sampling inference methods failed to reduce bias when it occurred. Whether the data required to remove bias and measure precision can be collected in a respondent-driven sampling survey is unresolved. Respondent-driven sampling should be regarded as a (potentially superior) form of convenience sampling method, and caution is required when interpreting findings based on the sampling method.},

We advance two {BHR} conceptualizations that will provide guidance for integrating human rights in management with organization studies research and thereby enlarge the cross-disciplinary conversation on {BHR}: {BHR} as Global Governance and {BHR} as Sensemaking. This paper expands existing management and organization studies constructs, invites management and organization studies scholars to provide their insights into this important research domain, and discusses the implications of human rights for the firm.},

One strategy for learning about these groups, or subpopulations, involves reaching hard-to-reach group members through their social network. In this paper we compare the efficiency of two common methods for subpopulation size estimation using data from standard surveys. These designs are examples of mental link tracing designs. These designs begin with a randomly sampled set of network members (nodes) and then reach other nodes indirectly through questions asked to the sampled nodes. Mental link tracing designs cost significantly less than traditional link tracing designs, yet introduce additional sources of potential bias. We examine the influence of one such source of bias using simulation studies. We then demonstrate our findings using data from the General Social Survey collected in 2004 and 2006. Additionally, we provide survey design suggestions for future surveys incorporating such designs.},

@article{feehan_survey_2022,
	abstract = {Researchers increasingly use aggregate relational data to learn about the size and distribution of survey respondents' weak-tie personal networks. Aggregate relational data are collected by asking questions about respondents' connectedness to many different groups (e.g., ``How many teachers do you know?''). This approach can be powerful, but to use aggregate relational data, researchers must locate external information about the size of each group from a census or administrative records (e.g., the number of teachers in the population). This need for external information makes aggregate relational data difficult or impossible to collect in many settings. Here, the authors show that relatively simple modifications can overcome this need for external data, significantly increasing the flexibility of the method and weakening key assumptions required by the associated estimators. The key idea is to estimate the size of these groups from the sample of survey respondents, rather than relying on external sources of information. These methods are appropriate for using a sample survey to study the size and distribution of weak-tie network connections. They can also be used as part of the network scale-up method to estimate the size of hidden populations. The authors illustrate this approach with two empirical studies: a large simulation study and original household survey data collected in Hanoi, Vietnam.},

	abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling ({RDS}) is a network-based form of chain-referral sampling used to estimate attributes of populations that are difficult to access using standard survey tools. Although it has grown quickly in popularity since its introduction, the statistical properties of {RDS} estimates remain elusive. In particular, the sampling variability of these estimates has been shown to be much higher than previously acknowledged, and even methods designed to account for {RDS} result in misleadingly narrow confidence intervals. In this paper, we introduce a tree bootstrap method for estimating uncertainty in {RDS} estimates based on resampling recruitment trees. We use simulations from known social networks to show that the tree bootstrap method not only outperforms existing methods but also captures the high variability of {RDS}, even in extreme cases with high design effects. We also apply the method to data from injecting drug users in Ukraine. Unlike other methods, the tree bootstrap depends only on the structure of the sampled recruitment trees, not on the attributes being measured on the respondents, so correlations between attributes can be estimated as well as variability. Our results suggest that it is possible to accurately assess the high level of uncertainty inherent in {RDS}.},

There is a growing interest in the estimation of uncertainty for {RDS} as recent findings suggest that most variance estimators underestimate variability. Recently, Baraff et al. proposed the tree bootstrap method based on resampling the {RDS} recruitment tree, and empirically showed that this method outperforms current bootstrap methods. However, some findings suggest that the tree bootstrap (severely) overestimates uncertainty. In this article, we propose the neighborhood bootstrap method for quantifying uncertainty in {RDS}. We prove the consistency of our method under some conditions and investigate its finite sample performance, through a simulation study, under realistic {RDS} sampling assumptions.},

@article{keeling_call_2022,
	abstract = {Purpose The research landscape is rapidly changing and people need to evolve the way in which they think about publishing their work. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the new article type -- the impact article -- which is specifically designed to allow collaborators to showcase their impact work and also share learning about how impact is (or is not) achieved. Design/methodology/approach This introductory paper outlines the rationale for the impact article and explains its new structure, using examples from the very first set of five impact articles to be published in the journal. Findings There is a clear appetite for sharing and learning more about the reality of impact. Providing a facilitating structure to enable sharing, this study identifies five core building blocks to bringing about valuable impact: problem generation and identifying the impact to be achieved; working with stakeholders; the (co-)creation and learning process; impact outcomes; and the ethics of impact. Research limitations/implications The new impact article type encourages authors to explore the impact process from start to finish, and to share learning about the process, including dealing with the unexpected and often changing nature of impact. These important learnings will inform future impact work, especially learning about what can (and cannot) be achieved and in what timeframes. Practical implications Collaboration is key to achieving impact. The new impact article aims to give voice to all stakeholders, through co-authorship opportunities and exploring the differences in perspectives on impact between stakeholders, including differing understanding of the ethics of impact. And to encourage multi-stakeholder co-creative working by enabling the sharing of best practice models and methods of collaborative working. Originality/value This new type of article aims to celebrate and make explicit the impact of research and so complements existing types of articles that might be separately published on the research itself. The impact article is designed to facilitate knowledge exchange about impact, not underlying research conceptualization and methodologies, but the challenge of designing, developing, tracking and demonstrating impact.},

	abstract = {Over the past three decades the provision of adult social care in England has undergone systemic change. Residential care and nursing homes previously under Local Authority control have contracted-out services to private providers and the introduction of direct payments has offered service-users greater choice of and control over their care. We present findings, from in-depth interviews with practising managers, which suggest that gaps in the existing legislative and regulatory frameworks for public procurement leave care-workers at heightened risk of modern slavery. Despite the potential benefits in terms of organisational efficiency and care personalisation that the marketisation of care has delivered, our study suggests that longer and more complex supply chains and weakened managerial oversight may have led to a widespread and serious deterioration in the employment conditions experienced by care-workers. Our findings raise questions about the protection of and accountability for human rights in these altered working conditions.},

@article{craig_who_2017,
	abstract = {Purpose The 2015 Modern Slavery Act focusses attention forms of modern slavery (human trafficking and forced labour), within the {UK}. The contemporaneous 2014 Care Act, identifies modern slavery as a new form of risk within adult social care, listing forms of abuse and vulnerability. However, it does not consider whether those providing care may themselves be vulnerable to forms of modern slavery. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The authors describe the history of the development of modern slavery legislation in the {UK}, outline key provisions of the Care Act, illustrated with real-life cases. The analysis suggests that adult social care -- characterised by informality, fragmentation and vulnerability -- is one where instances of modern slavery may be more common than considered to date. Findings The data collected, though relatively modest, suggests that a thorough investigation should be undertaken into the possibility of modern slavery taking place within the realm of adult social care. Research limitations/implications Data have been collected through a snowball process, rolling out a survey to relevant groups of individual and organisations. A more rigorous investigation is required to examine the extent of modern slavery within adult social care. Practical implications The training of those responsible for the regulation/management of adult social care needs to ensure that they are fully equipped to understand the nature of modern slavery and how to identify its symptoms and victims. Social implications There is also a need for heightened awareness of those close to people being cared for that they may also identify the symptoms of modern slavery. Originality/value This area has not been explored to date.},

	abstract = {Research strategies which emphasize participation are increasingly used in health research. Breaking the linear mould of conventional research, participatory research focuses on a process of sequential reflection and action, carried out with and by local people rather than on them. Local knowledge and perspectives are not only acknowledged but form the basis for research and planning. Many of the methods used in participatory research are drawn from mainstream disciplines and conventional research itself involves varying degrees of participation. The key difference between participatory and conventional methodologies lies in the location of power in the research process. We review some of the participatory methodologies which are currently being popularized in health research, focusing on the issue of control over the research process. Participatory research raises personal, professional and political challenges which go beyond the bounds of the production of information. Problematizing `participation', we explore the challenges and dilemmas of participatory practice.},

Learning activity is offered as a helpful focus for educational design, and Activity Theory is used to develop a model of design practice which focuses on different aspects of activity. A learning outcome is an identifiable change that is anticipated in the learner. An outcomes-based approach to learning tends to assume that learners will respond to task demands in similar ways. The chapter also considers how digital technologies change the activities available to learners, the social environment in which they learn, and the kinds of learning outcome it makes sense for them to pursue, showing how the use of digital technologies changes the meaning of a learning activity, subtly or profoundly. It looks directly at the digital artefacts that are used in learning.},

The focus of this work was at the level of the academic school using a range of change practices including the appointment of school-based learning technologists and e-learning champions, supporting schools to write their own strategies, a pedagogical framework of engaging with e-learning, and curriculum development and evaluation of school-supported projects. It is clear that the implementation of the e-learning strategy has led to a large and increasing proportion of our students experiencing blended learning. In addition, there are initial indications that this has enhanced some learning and teaching processes. Where there has been sustainable embedding of effective e-learning, the following levers were identified as particularly important: flexibility in practices that allow schools to contextualise their plans for change, the facilitation of communities of key staff and creating opportunities for staff to voice and challenge their beliefs about e-learning.{DOI}: 10.1080/09687760600668503},

@article{evans_achieving_2016,
	abstract = {While many academics are sceptical about the 'impact agenda', it may offer the potential to re-value feminist and participatory approaches to the co-production of knowledge. Drawing on my experiences of developing a {UK} Research Excellence Framework ({REF}) impact case study based on research on young caregiving in the {UK}, Tanzania and Uganda, I explore the dilemmas and tensions of balancing an ethic of care and participatory praxis with research management demands to evidence 'impact' in the neoliberal academy. The participatory dissemination process enabled young people to identify their support needs, which translated into policy and practice recommendations and in turn, produced 'impact'. It also revealed a paradox of action-oriented research: this approach may bring greater emotional investment of the participants in the project in potentially negative as well as positive ways, resulting in disenchantment that the research did not lead to tangible outcomes at local level. Participatory praxis may also pose ethical dilemmas for researchers who have responsibilities to care for both 'proximate' and 'distant' others. The 'more than research' relationship I developed with practitioners was motivated by my ethic of care rather than by the demands of the audit culture. Furthermore, my research and the impacts cited emerged slowly and incrementally from a series of small grants in an unplanned, serendipitous way at different scales, which may be difficult to fit within institutional audits of 'impact'. Given the growing pressures on academics, it seems ever more important to embody an ethic of care in university settings, as well as in the 'field'. We need to join the call for 'slow scholarship' and advocate a re-valuing of feminist and participatory action research approaches, which may have most impact at local level, in order to achieve meaningful shifts in the impact agenda and more broadly, the academy.},

@book{archer_realist_1995,
	abstract = {Building on her seminal contribution to social theory in Culture and Agency, in this 1995 book Margaret Archer develops her morphogenetic approach, applying it to the problem of structure and agency. Since structure and agency constitute different levels of stratified social reality, each possesses distinctive emergent properties which are real and causally efficacious but irreducible to one another. The problem, therefore, is shown to be how to link the two rather than conflate them, as has been common theoretical practice. Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach not only rejects methodological individualism and holism, but argues that the debate between them has been replaced by a new one, between elisionary theorising and emergentist theories based on a realist ontology of the social world. The morphogenetic approach is the sociological complement of transcendental realism, and together they provide a basis for non-conflationary theorizing which is also of direct utility to the practising social analyst.},

@article{chubb_politics_2018,
	abstract = {There is growing interest in demonstrating the societal and economic value of research around the world with the {UK} and Australia at the forefront of these developments. Characterised as an `impact agenda', impact policies have incited debate amongst the academic community and beyond. On the one hand, the edifying and reinforcing effects of impact can be seen to provide greater visibility about the use of public investment in research, whilst, on the other concerns about the subsequent and unintended effects on the nature and quality of research and research cultures, have contributed to a discourse which was (in the very beginning at least) one dominated by resistance. We draw on a qualitative analysis of interviews with {UK} and Australian mid-senior career academics (n = 51) which explored academic perceptions for resisting an impact agenda, to describe a range of perceived effects on research funding, motivation and quality. We find a persistent perception that impact favours and prioritises `types' of research, leading to a concern that this will reduce funding for certain disciplines. We also note how academics perceived deleterious effects on motivation, culture, capacity and the quality of research. Where impact was seen to `direct' or `drive' research, we discuss how some academics suggested they would re-orientate their work, often at the expense of quality. Indeed, misconceptions about the very meaning of `impact' appear to persist alongside varied intepretations of impact policies and mixed perceptions about how impact is considered in practice with respect to funding decisions. In addition, we posit that extrinsic motivations for impact are `crowding out' intrinsic motivations of academics, altering perceptions of self-determination. This is further compounded by the growing politicisation of knowledge which in turn creates an ideological barrier to engagement. If impact is to be embraced and sustained at scale, institutions must target and harness a wider range of intrinsic motivations and epistemic responsibilities, improving academics' abilities to respond to the impact agenda in addition to working with, not against those who create policy.},

	abstract = {Many populations of interest present special challenges for traditional survey methodology when it is difficult or impossible to obtain a traditional sampling frame. In the case of such "hidden" populations at risk of {HIV}/{AIDS}, many researchers have resorted to chain-referral sampling. Recent progress on the theory of chain-referral sampling has led to Respondent Driven Sampling ({RDS}), a rigorous chain-referral method which allows unbiased estimation of the target population. In this article we present new probability-theoretic methods for making estimates from {RDS} data. The new estimators offer improved simplicity, analytical tractability, and allow the estimation of continuous variables. An analytical variance estimator is proposed in the case of estimating categorical variables. The properties of the estimator and the associated variance estimator are explored in a simulation study, and compared to alternative {RDS} estimators using data from a study of New York City jazz musicians. The new estimator gives results consistent with alternative {RDS} estimators in the study of jazz musicians, and demonstrates greater precision than alternative estimators in the simulation study.},

@article{reed_place-based_2017,
	abstract = {Payment for Ecosystem Services ({PES}) schemes are proliferating but are challenged by insufficient attention to spatial and temporal inter-dependencies, interactions between different ecosystems and their services, and the need for multi-level governance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to the development and implementation of {PES} schemes that incorporates multi-level governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based {PES} scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's {UK} Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers' preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around £2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair price per tonne of {CO}2 equivalent from £11.18 to £15.65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively. The Peatland Code was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders at catchment, landscape and national scales, enabling multi-level governance of the management and delivery of ecosystem services across these scales. Place-based {PES} schemes can mitigate negative trade-offs between ecosystem services, more effectively include cultural ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance.},

@article{reed_evaluating_2021,
	abstract = {Background
Interest in impact evaluation has grown rapidly as research funders increasingly demand evidence that their investments lead to public benefits.
Aims
This paper analyses literature to provide a new definition of research impact and impact evaluation, develops a typology of research impact evaluation designs, and proposes a methodological framework to guide evaluations of the significance and reach of impact that can be attributed to research.
Method
An adapted Grounded Theory Analysis of research impact evaluation frameworks drawn from cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed and grey literature.
Results
Recognizing the subjective nature of impacts as they are perceived by different groups in different times, places and cultures, we define research impact evaluation as the process of assessing the significance and reach of both positive and negative effects of research. Five types of impact evaluation design are identified encompassing a range of evaluation methods and approaches: i) experimental and statistical methods; ii) textual, oral and arts-based methods; iii) systems analysis methods; iv) indicator-based approaches; and v) evidence synthesis approaches. Our guidance enables impact evaluation design to be tailored to the aims and context of the evaluation, for example choosing a design to establish a body of research as a necessary (e.g. a significant contributing factor amongst many) or sufficient (e.g. sole, direct) cause of impact, and choosing the most appropriate evaluation design for the type of impact being evaluated.
Conclusion
Using the proposed definitions, typology and methodological framework, researchers, funders and other stakeholders working across multiple disciplines can select a suitable evaluation design and methods to evidence the impact of research from any discipline.},

@article{larkins_sustainability_2018,
	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the textual coverage of the topic of public engagement in leading English language sustainability textbooks. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors' findings are based on a content analysis of 12 textbooks published between 2005 and 2015. The authors generated the sample through three sources: a review of the offerings of five major academic publishers, title searches of academic databases and an examination of the syllabi compiled by {AASHE}. Texts that displayed a high degree of disciplinarity or those that were narrowly focused were rejected. A list of a priori codes was established in which the authors expected to find in the indices of the texts. This resulted in 21 expected a priori codes for which the authors assessed the sample texts to gauge the place of engagement in these materials. Findings The authors find that only two textbooks contained ten or more references to engagement. Overall, very little attention was paid to the ways in which individuals, groups or institutions can engage in action for a sustainable society. The authors argue that substantive changes in the writing of textbooks are necessary to provide students with comprehensive training on why engagement is critical. More diverse writing teams, attention to cultural obstacles and mindfulness of the politics of difference are recommended. Practical implications Practical implications include pedagogical methods aimed at better-informed students knowledgeable of the importance of public engagement in the sustainability transition. Social implications Social implications include a more dynamic socially sustainable educational experience for students, which is aligned with cutting-edge scholarship. Originality/value The authors know of no other research devoted to the analysis of engagement in contemporary sustainability textbooks. The authors hope to encourage writers of sustainability textbooks and their editors to incorporate more robust social science scholarship on pivotal topics such as how social change and action intersects with sustainability. Second, the authors seek to broaden a conversation about the role of public engagement in sustainability-focused textbooks and curricula.},

@article{gourlay_there_2021,
	abstract = {The distinction between face-to-face and distant digitally-mediated educational engagement is a complex one, and the two modes are often combined in practice, via `blended learning' or the use of a {VLE} to support campus-based teaching. The current Covid-19 pandemic has thrown this distinction into relief, in a context where educationalists have been forced to move to fully distant engagement in a very short timeframe. This paper explores how this predicament has brought to the fore the nature of our engagement with digital knowledge practices and screen-based communication, arguing that the notion of `virtual learning' is a flawed one. Instead, adopting a sociomaterial perspective, it argues that all aspects of digital engagement are in fact grounded in material and embodied entanglements with devices and other artefacts.},

@article{sedacca_migrant_2024,
	abstract = {This article addresses work-related and gendered harms of the `hostile environment', a set of measures implemented through the Immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016, which aims to make life in the {UK} impossible for irregular migrants. The hostile environment criminalises work without legal status, facilitates data sharing between public bodies and immigration enforcement, and restricts access services and benefits. The article examines factors that can make women susceptible to irregularity and exposure to hostile environment measures, and distinctive forms of gendered harm such as workplace sexual harassment. It argues that the detrimental impacts of the hostile environment contravene international and regional human rights obligations. Barring certain migrants from access to the labour market may violate the socio-economic right to work and/ or the right to private and family life, while a lack of access to legal remedy or labour inspection fuelled can violate migrants' right to decent work and undermine protections against forced labour. The {UK}'s recent ratification of the Council of Europe's `Istanbul Convention' and {ILO} Convention 190 on violence and harassment at work signifies a renewed commitment to safeguarding women regardless of migration status, but the universalistic potential of these instruments is undermined by the hostile environment's continued operation.},

We start with a definition of {PCSR}, focusing on firms' contribution to public goods. We then discuss historical antecedents to the debate and outline the original economic and political context. The following section explores emerging changes in the institutional context relevant to {PCSR} and reconsiders some of the assumptions underlying Habermas' thesis of the postnational constellation. This highlights some neglected issues in previous works on {PCSR}, including the influence of nationalism and fundamentalism, the role of various types of business organisations, the return of government regulation, the complexity of institutional contexts, the efficiency of private governance, the financialization and digitalization of the economy, and the relevance of managerial sensemaking. Finally, we discuss the contributions to this special issue and relate them to the newly emerging research agenda.},

In response, the present study is the first to comprehensively encapsulate the current state of research on {GVCs} through the lens of corporate sustainability by conducting a systematic review of all pertinently focused, peer-reviewed academic papers. This study defines and refines the association between sustainability standards, policies, and {GVCs} within an international business context.

	abstract = {Sustainable supply chain management has been an important research issue for the last two decades due to climate change. From a global perspective, the United Nations have introduced sustainable development goals, which point towards sustainability. Manufacturing supply chains are among those that produce harmful effluents into the environment in addition to social issues that impact societies and economies where they operate. New developments in information and communication technologies, especially big data analytics ({BDA}), can help create new insights that can detect parts and members of a supply chain whose activities are unsustainable and take corrective action. While many studies have addressed sustainable supply chain management ({SSCM}), studies on the effect of {BDA} on {SSCM} in the context of manufacturing supply chains are limited. This conceptual paper applies Toulmin's argumentation model to review relevant literature and draw conclusions. The study identifies the elements of big data analytics as data processing, analytics, reporting, integration, security and economic. The aspects of sustainable {SCM} are transparency, sustainability culture, corporate goals and risk management. It is established that {BDA} enhances {SSCM} of manufacturing supply chains. Cyberattacks and information technology skills gap are some of the challenges impeding {BDA} implementation. The paper makes a conceptual and methodological contribution to supply chain management literature by linking big data analytics and {SSCM} in manufacturing supply chains by using the rarely used Toulmin's argumentation model in management studies.},

Scholars and proactive companies have begun to create more sustainable supply chains. What has not been fully addressed is how organizations deal with short-term pressures to remain economically viable while implementing these newly modeled supply chains. In this study, we use theory-building through case studies to answer the question: how do organizations balance short-term profitability and long-term environmental sustainability when making supply chain decisions under conditions of uncertainty? We present five sets of propositions that explain how exemplars in green supply chain management make decisions and balance short and long term objectives. We also identify four environmental postures that help explain the decisions organizations make when dealing with strategic trade-offs among the economic, environmental and social elements of the triple-bottom-line.},

@article{wilhelm_sustainability_2016,
	abstract = {In light of the growing complexity of globally dispersed, multi-tier supply chains, the involvement of first-tier suppliers has become instrumental in the quest for achieving sustainability compliance along the supply chain. We describe this new responsibility as the double agency role. We employ agency and institutional theory arguments to explore the conditions under which first-tier suppliers will act as agents who fulfill the lead firm's sustainability requirements (i.e., the primary agency role) and implement these requirements in their suppliers' operations (i.e., the secondary agency role). The findings from three in-depth case studies embedded in different institutional contexts highlight the importance for lead firms to incentivize each agency role separately and to reduce information asymmetries, particularly at the second-tier level. In addition, our inductive analysis reveals several contingency factors that influence the coupling of the secondary agency role of the first-tier supplier. These factors include resource availability at the first-tier supplier's firm, the lead firm's focus on the triple-bottom-line dimension (i.e., environmental or social), the lead firm's use of power, and the lead firm's internal alignment of the sustainability and purchasing function. We integrate our findings in a conceptual framework that advances the research agenda on multi-tier sustainable supply chains, and we subsequently outline the practical implications of assigning the double agency role to first tier suppliers.},

@article{gualandris_sustainable_2015,
	abstract = {Managers are being challenged by multiple (and diverse) stakeholders, which have variety of expectations and informational needs about their firm's supply chains. Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders' expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification ({SEV}) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of {SEV} systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an {SEV} system can create a competitive advantage are investigated.},

This paper revisits some of the conceptual developments of the field-building on Seuring and M{\"u}ller (2008). We draw upon this framework and its core constructs to revisit the status quo of theory development in {SSCM}. We reflect on the research needs for each construct of the initial framework. Some constructs, like drivers and barriers, are well researched, while stakeholder management issues or supplier development warrant future research. Risk and performance aspects will stay on the agenda, albeit some more critical accounts are needed. This discussion forms the second main part of the paper thereby pointing toward future research needs. The link between digital transformation and sustainable development would be one of the core topics driving change in {SSCM}. More research on emerging economies and the environmental and social impact of supply chains in such contexts would be welcome. Contemplating on the constructs' content and arrangement for prospective future endeavours drive this research, while not conducting a complete analysis including all aspects can be seen as a limitation.},

@article{hartmann_chain_2014,
	abstract = {When it becomes publicly known that products are associated with suppliers that engage in unsustainable behaviors, consumers protest, as Nestl{\'e}, Zara, and Kimberly Clark, among others, have learned. The phenomenon by which consumers hold firms responsible for the unsustainable behavior of their upstream partners suggests the notion of ``chain liability.'' This study aims to generate insights into the antecedents and consequences of such consumer responsibility attributions. Using data from four vignette-based survey experiments, the authors find that the chain liability effect increases if an environmental degradation incident (1) results from supplier behavior rather than force majeure, (2) results from a company decision rather than the decision of an individual employee, and (3) is more severe. Responsibility attributions do not differ with varying organizational distance from the supplier, firm size, strategic importance of the supplied product, or the existence of environmental management systems. The chain liability effect also creates strong risks for the focal firm; higher responsibility attributions increase consumers' anger and propensity to boycott. Therefore, firms should work to ensure sustainable behavior throughout the supply chain, to protect them from chain liability.},

The first facet is adoption, which accounts for the development of preparatory grounds -- for facilitating the generation of a {SSCM} philosophy to gradually seep into the frame of traditional supply chain management ({SCM}). The second facet of implementation accounts for the manifestation of a {SSCM}-oriented transformation for producing gradual upgrades in the traditional {SCM} environment. The third facet of extension signifies the broadening of the scope of implementation at a more wider (supply chain) level. The fourth facet of maintenance outlines the need for ensuring the continuity of progress in the course of {SSCM} development. The fifth facet of outcomes focuses on the yields of {SSCM}'s pursuit.,These principal facets are built across the multiple levels and unique conceptual standpoints as propagated by 13 themes and 34 sub-themes. These themes are generated based upon 419 articles (2000-2017) from more than 40 leading journals. The authors discuss the facet-specific key implications for guiding the literature in its further advancement, and thus propose a rigorous thematic landscape of the {SSCM} literature with a unique approach. Overall, the outcomes of this review provide a fundamental organization of the {SSCM} literature -- from the perspective of a journey involved in the transition from traditional to sustainable supply chains.},

However, findings from these studies have found positive and negative associations, leaving practitioners perplexed as to what actions would be beneficial to pursue. With hypotheses grounded in the natural resource--based view of the firm, the current study examines over 20 years of research on environmental supply chain practices using a meta-analysis to determine whether the overall effect of these specific practices on firm performance is, in fact, positive. The results show that the link between environmental supply chain practices and market-based, operational-based and accounting-based forms of firm performance is positive and significant, providing support for the business case that sustainable supply chain management results in increased firm performance. Different operationalizations of supply chain practices --- upstream, design, production and downstream --- along with industry, sample region, firm size and time are examined as moderators of this relationship with nuanced results that help to extend the discipline's understanding of the relationship between environmentally sustainable supply chain management and firm performance.},

	abstract = {An instrumental perspective still dominates research on sustainable supply chain management ({SSCM}). As an alternative, this study presents a paradox perspective and argues that sustainability and other business aims are not always compatible, particularly in an emerging market context. Often, paradoxical tensions originate in conflicts between the socioeconomic environment of emerging market suppliers and their Western customers' demands for both cost competitiveness and sustainability. We argue that Western buying firms can play a key role in moderating such tensions, as experienced by emerging market suppliers. Specifically, we explore how purchasing and sustainability managers within buying firms make sense of and respond to paradoxical tensions in {SSCM}. We conduct an in-depth case study of a Western multinational company that sources substantially from Chinese suppliers. While we found strong evidence for a persisting instrumental perspective in the sensemaking and practices of purchasing and sustainability managers, we also observed an alternative response, primarily by sustainability managers that we labeled as ``contextualizing.'' Contextualizing can alleviate the tensions otherwise present in {SSCM} by making sustainability standards more workable in an emerging market context, and it can help individual managers to move toward paradoxical sensemaking. We outline the value of paradoxical sensemaking in bringing about changes toward ``true sustainability'' in {SSCM}.},

	abstract = {Although the literature on modern slavery ({MS}) is continually increasing, there remains a paucity of theory-driven research. Hence, this study aims to develop a multitheoretical framework and research agenda for {MS}.,This study comprised two steps. First, it reviews the literature on supply chain ({SC}) social sustainability to identify the typically used theories. Six of them were selected for this study: institutional, stakeholder, resource-based, resource dependence, principal agent and transaction cost economics theories. Second, it conducts a systematic literature review using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines to analyze relevant literature on social issues in {SCs}, and thematically synthesizes the findings. The six theoretical perspectives and key themes that emerged from the literature were used to develop future research directions ({RDs}) for {MS}.,This study develops a multitheoretical framework and research agenda comprising 20 theory-driven {RDs} for {MS}, focusing on the environmental, firm and transaction levels.,This study provides a reference for future {MS} research. Although the study used only six theories, future studies can develop further research agendas for {MS} based on diverse theories.,Practitioners can use this framework to understand {MS} from varied perspectives and identify and mitigate {MS} risks in {SCs}.,To the best of the author's knowledge, this study presents the first comprehensive and theoretically grounded research agenda that positions {MS} research onto a stronger theoretical foundation.},

@article{rogerson_theorizing_nodate,
	abstract = {Modern slavery is increasingly recognized as a supply chain risk to both workers and firms. Neither corporate efforts nor market-based regulation has adequately addressed the issue. This is largely because they fail to reconcile the conflicting priorities between efficiency and anti-slavery goals inherent in such efforts. Public sector purchasing---often conducted through meta-organizations---offers both the scale and scope needed to change supply chain behaviors. Yet meta-organizations and how they effect change remain underexplored and under-theorized. Through analysis of archival material and 44 interviews with public sector buyers and purchasing consortia managers, we construct two case studies of meta-organizations. These cases reveal rich insights into meta-organizations' capacity both to improve public sector knowledge and compliance around modern slavery and to compel suppliers to enhance their anti-slavery efforts. The findings show that, by adapting purchasing structures and developing expertise, and thereby hybridizing the logics of efficiency and anti-slavery, purchasing consortia can embed accountability within and beyond the bounds of their memberships. The study contributes to theories of meta-organizations and institutional logics in the context of supply chain management and to policy and practice on modern slavery in supply chains.},

After detection of slavery, multi-stakeholder partnerships, community-centred approaches and supplier development appear to be effective responses. , -- New theory development in supply chain management ({SCM}) is urgently needed to facilitate the understanding, avoidance and elimination of slavery in supply chains. As a starting point for future research, the challenges of slavery to {SCM} are conceptualised, focussing on capabilities and specific institutional context. , -- The paper provides a starting point for the development of practices and tools for identifying and removing slave labour from supply chains. , -- Although representing a substantial threat to current supply chain models, slavery has so far not been addressed in {SCM} research.},

An estimated 40.3 million people worldwide are in modern slavery, working in a range of supply chains, including construction and facilities management. In this article, we show how the {UK} construction and facilities management sector responded to this challenge through an intra-industry initiative and went through a process of collaborative sense-making and sector-wide agreement on a joint approach to challenge modern slavery in the sector's operations and supply chains. The research takes an engaged research approach whereby the researchers have been able to gain deep and continued access to the phenomenon from participation in a multi-company initiative on the implementation of responses to the {UK} Modern Slavery Act in supply chain and procurement activities of their sector. We identify and discuss key areas for supply chain and procurement practitioners tasked with addressing a human rights topic in their operations and supply chains: Motivation, risk hot-spots, challenges and response and provide a rich understanding of an intra-industry initiative which creates a basis for further research on collective sustainability approaches by businesses who are otherwise commercial competitors. The study's results and insights are useful for policymakers and practitioners who are aiming to apply market-based approaches for sustainability improvements in supply chains.},

To address recognition justice for workers in global supply chains, the worker voice agenda must consider designing worker voice mechanisms to close recognition gaps for workers with marginalised identities; the shared responsibilities of supply chain actors to listen alongside the expectation of workers to use their voice; and the expansion of the concept of worker voice to cut across home-work boundaries.,The paper offers conceptual clarity on the emerging notion of worker voice in {SSCM} and is the first to interrogate the implications of recognition justice for the emergent worker voice agenda.

	abstract = {Measuring, analyzing, and evaluating social, environmental, and economic impact is crucial to aligning the sustainable development strategies of international organizations, governments, and businesses. In this sense, society has been a determining factor exerting pressure for urgent solutions. The main objective of this paper is to provide an exhaustive analysis of the literature about the tools for measuring social impact and their evolution over the last 50 years. The search was conducted in the main academic databases (Scopus and Web of Science), where 924 articles were found from 1969 to 2020 related to the topic. The results of the quantitative analysis show that 71\% of the publications were in the last ten years and the most productive countries were the {USA} and the United Kingdom. The relational analysis identifies 4 large clusters that fragment the literature into different subfields. The most used keywords are linked to the term "Social" in measurement methods, new concepts, and participants. This article contributes to the literature by giving the researcher an insight into the current state of art, trends, categories within the field, and future lines of research.},

@article{franks_social_2013,
	abstract = {Social Impact Assessment ({SIA}) has traditionally been practiced as a predictive study for the regulatory approval of major projects, however, in recent years the drivers and domain of focus for {SIA} have shifted. This paper details the emergence of Social Impact Management Plans ({SIMPs}) and undertakes an analysis of innovations in corporate and public policy that have put in place ongoing processes -- assessment, management and monitoring -- to better identify the nature and scope of the social impacts that might occur during implementation and to proactively respond to change across the lifecycle of developments. Four leading practice examples are analyzed. The International Finance Corporation ({IFC}) Performance Standards require the preparation of Environmental and Social Management Plans for all projects financed by the {IFC} identified as having significant environmental and social risks. Anglo American, a major resources company, has introduced a Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox, which requires mine sites to undertake regular assessments and link these assessments with their internal management systems, monitoring activities and a Social Management Plan. In South Africa, Social and Labour Plans are submitted with an application for a mining or production right. In Queensland, Australia, Social Impact Management Plans were developed as part of an Environmental Impact Statement, which included assessment of social impacts. Collectively these initiatives, and others, are a practical realization of theoretical conceptions of {SIA} that include management and monitoring as core components of {SIA}. The paper concludes with an analysis of the implications for the practice of impact assessment including a summary of key criteria for the design and implementation of effective {SIMPs}.},

	abstract = {Social Impact Assessments ({SIAs}) have played an increasingly important role in the conduct of planned interventions, providing proponents the capacity to assess and manage the social consequences of their activities. Whilst the {SIA} field has experienced significant conceptual and practical development over the last decade, efforts at consolidating this within one framework have been limited. In this paper, we incorporate this new knowledge by redeveloping and thus updating the {SIA} procedural framework developed by Interorganizational Committee on Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment. In doing so, this updated procedural framework has attempted to incorporate current `best practice' that focuses on participatory approaches to undertaking an {SIA}. This involved making adaptions to two steps, expansions to five steps, integration of a stronger participatory approach to six steps, and the development of a new step, Management and Evaluation reflecting moves towards ex-post use of {SIA} processes. It is hoped that this consolidation of the literature of a decade's worth of key findings in {SIA} research will lead to further efforts towards a meta-evaluation of {SIA} literature and a platform from which newer developments may be further investigated.},

The international contributors consider a number of key epistemological, ontological and methodological questions. They explore what community peer research means in a range of settings, for a range of people, for the quality of data and subsequent findings, and for the production of rigorous social research. The collection will also stimulate thinking about how methodological advancement can be made in the field. It is the first book of its kind to combine practical and methodological reflections with clearly presented recommendations about how the approach can be used. Presenting the latest thinking in the field and providing summaries, case studies and review questions, 'Community research for participation' will be invaluable to students, researchers, academics and practitioners who aim to place community members at the centre of their research.},

@article{reed_re-thinking_2023,
	abstract = {The world is facing unprecedented challenges on a scale that has never been seen before, and the need for evidence-informed solutions has never been greater. As a result, academics, policy-makers, practitioners, and research funders are increasingly seeking to undertake or support research that achieves tangible impacts on policy and practice. However, the impact of research is inherently subjective, with the same outcome perceived as either beneficial or negative by different groups, or by the same group in different contexts. It is therefore important to consider factors that may increase the likelihood that outcomes from research are perceived as beneficial (or otherwise) by interested/affected groups and non-academic partners, to help researchers avoid causing potentially harmful impacts, despite their best intentions. In this overview article, we discuss three considerations for re-thinking how research can deliver such outcomes: (i) sensitivity to context, (ii) representation and legitimisation of diverse voices and (iii) the management of power dynamics. We then discuss how these can be enacted in research and engagement processes that are designed to incorporate multiple ways of viewing reality and knowledge, as researchers become increasingly aware of their positionality, privilege, assumptions and biases. By considering how research and impact generation processes are mediated by context, power and voice, it may be possible to envision just transformations of knowledge systems that foreground the knowledge and needs of diverse groups, including those who have been historically marginalised, and without systematically recognising or privileging one group over another.},

@article{lebaron_governing_2017,
	abstract = {Over the past two decades multinational corporations have been expanding `ethical' audit programs with the stated aim of reducing the risk of sourcing from suppliers with poor practices. A wave of government regulation---such as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (2012) and the {UK} Modern Slavery Act (2015)---has enhanced the legitimacy of auditing as a tool to govern labor and environmental standards in global supply chains, backed by a broad range of civil society actors championing audits as a way of promoting corporate accountability. The growing adoption of auditing as a governance tool is a puzzling trend, given two decades of evidence that audit programs generally fail to detect or correct labor and environmental problems in global supply chains. Drawing on original field research, this article shows that in spite of its growing legitimacy and traction among government and civil society actors, the audit regime continues to respond to and protect industry commercial interests.

	abstract = {This article critically investigates the growing power and effectiveness of the `ethical' compliance audit regime. Over the last decade, audits have evolved from a tool for companies to track internal organisational performance into a transnational governing mechanism to measure and strengthen corporate accountability globally and shape corporate responsibility norms. Drawing on original interviews, we assess the effectiveness of supply chain benchmarks and audits in promoting environmental and social improvements in global retail supply chains. Two principal arguments emerge from our analysis. First, that audits can be best understood as a productive form of power, which codifies and legitimates retail corporations' poor social and environmental records, and shapes state approaches to supply chain governance. Second, that growing public and government trust in audit metrics ends up concealing real problems in global supply chains. Retailers are, in fact, auditing only small portions of supply chains, omitting the portions of supply chains where labour and environmental abuse are most likely to take place. Furthermore, the audit regime tends to address labour and environmental issues very unevenly, since `people' are more difficult to classify and verify through numbers than capital and product quality.},

	abstract = {Forced labour poses a significant challenge within global supply chains, yet traditional compliance-based governance based on auditing has proven to be ineffective in addressing this issue. Non-government organizations and worker rights organizations can serve as crucial allies in supporting and safeguarding workers by assuming the role of a 'social intermediary' ({SI}) between supply chain firms and workers. However, these external organizations often hold limited power within these supply chains. In our paper, we examine the sources of power that {SIs} can cultivate and utilize to lead successful interventions against forced labour in supply chains. Through a comparative case study involving three {SIs} and their collaborative efforts with a global seafood brand, we explore various forms of non-mediated power and their underlying origins. By establishing these connections, we shed light on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of interventions against forced labour. Our research makes three contributions. First, we contribute to ongoing research on forced labour in supply chains by emphasizing the constructive role that {SIs} can play to protect vulnerable workers. Second, we address a critical gap in the existing literature concerning power of {SIs} in supply chain relations. More specifically, we specify sources and types of non-mediated power that {SI} can leverage to design effective interventions against forced labour. Third, by comparing unique data on two worker groups vulnerable to forced labour -- vessel workers and workers in seafood processing -- we provide much-needed insights into how working conditions in non-factory settings can still be regulated.},

@article{zajak_channels_2017,
	abstract = {This article examines the neglected question of workers' voice in the transnational governance of labour rights. While governance studies often neglect worker's agency and labour studies focus on strikes or collective bargaining, this article takes the theoretical lenses of recursivity to explore and compare new channels for worker participation that developed in the context of transnational governance schemes. Taking the example of the Fair Labor Association, a prominent multistakeholder initiative in the garment industry, the article distinguishes between three channels: workers' surveys during audits, complaint procedures, and local grievance mediation. Despite the fact that such opportunities count as key innovations for the participation of labour in transnational governance, statistical and qualitative data from {FLA}'s factory audits and self-conducted interviews show that locally situated actors, especially workers, are only occasionally able to make their voice heard in formally open channels. The article identifies two main sources of constraints: the first is workers' lack of knowledge of these channels and distrust towards these procedures. This is tied, secondly, to the more fundamental problem that business continues to have interpretative power over the nature of the problems and solutions in transnational labour governance.},

@article{berg_addressing_2020,
	abstract = {Multinational businesses are facing mounting pressure to identify and address risks of exploitation, trafficking and modern slavery in their supply chains. Digital worker reporting tools present unprecedented opportunities for lead firms to reach out directly to hard-to-reach workers for feedback on their working conditions via their mobile phone. These new technologies promise an efficient and cost-effective way to cut through the complexity of global production, gathering unmediated data on working conditions directly from workers at scale. As the market for these tools grows, this paper contextualises their emergence within the broader political economy of supply chain governance. It presents three sets of concerns about their use that must be addressed by businesses, investors, donors and governments that develop or utilise these tools. First, the quality of data gathered by these tools may be inadequate to reliably inform decision-making. Second, global brands may gather large quantities of worker data to identify legal, reputational and financial risks without addressing structural causes of exploitation or delivering outcomes for workers. Third, large scale collection of data from workers creates new risks for workers' wellbeing and safety.},

	abstract = {Modern slavery is one of the most prominent grand challenges facing organizations today. Yet, its precise meaning, and the scope of people and practices it subsumes, remain hotly contested. The recent formation of a legal category of ``modern slavery'' represents a critical point in establishing clear meanings and boundaries. While existing research on categories has shed light on how such new category meanings and boundaries may be shaped, we lack insight on how this happens in the absence of category prototypes that demarcate the meaning and membership of categories. We turn to category exemplars as an important but, as yet, poorly understood tool influencing category formation and subsequent membership. We conduct a systematic analysis of discourse surrounding the formation of the new category of modern slavery to identify three distinct forms of exemplars (typifying, familiarizing, and scoping), and develop a model that links actors' use of these exemplars to specific boundary effects across four phases of category formation. We also reveal the conditions under which different exemplars were successful in influencing the final category. We thereby contribute to the literature an exemplar-based theorization of new category formation that explains how categories associated with grand challenges like modern slavery are formed.},

	abstract = {Stakeholder orientation is a strategic approach to identify and mitigate supplier sustainability risk ({SSR}) across different institutional contexts. However, increased orientation may also alter stakeholder expectations and implied obligations, potentially exacerbating risk. We refer to this tension between opposing effects as the stakeholder orientation paradox. Drawing on stakeholder and expectancy theories, this study theorizes and empirically investigates the paradoxical relationship between a firm's stakeholder orientation and {SSR}, moderated by the institutional distance between the firm's home country and the country where the risk arises.,Econometric models are constructed and estimated using a unique panel dataset of 27,545 observations derived from multiple data sources from 2009 to 2023, encompassing 5,911 supply chain sustainability incidents across 170 countries and involving 811 buying firms headquartered in 44 countries.,Our findings reveal a paradoxical positive association between stakeholder orientation and {SSR}, amplified by institutional distance. Thus, notable evidence supports the need to integrate expectancy theory facets into stakeholder theory considerations as firms (re)shape their efforts to mitigate {SSR}.,As firms strengthen their stakeholder orientation, care must be exercised to avoid over-promising sustainability commitments and under-delivering on supply chain performance. Proactive engagement with diverse stakeholder groups, tailored to distant institutional contexts, can alert firms to emerging problems and prompt immediate action with suppliers before incidents escalate further.,This study contributes to the scarce empirical literature on {SSR} antecedents and advances understanding of counterintuitive stakeholder orientation outcomes. While prior research has highlighted the benefits of stakeholder orientation, our findings suggest that firms need to ``walk the talk'' to reduce {SSR}. Furthermore, by exploring the role of institutional distance, we extend the research on stakeholder orientation beyond its typical U.S.-centric scope.},

As the foremost interface to an increasingly global supply base, {PSM} plays an important role in the mitigation of sustainability-related risks. By conducting responsible purchasing and supplier management, the risk of corporate reputational damage to the buying firm, caused by supplier misconduct, can be avoided. However, resources for effective risk-mitigation are limited and the applicability of supply risk assessment and supplier assessment methods have not been evaluated for sustainability. In this paper, we explore how leading {PSM} functions identify, assess, and treat supplier sustainability risks and elaborate on the integration of sustainability risk management in supplier management processes. Based on the findings from a multiple case study in the chemical industry and by drawing on the dynamic capabilities view ({DCV}), we propose that mature and sustainable supplier management capabilities are a source of competitive advantage in terms of lower exposure to reputational risks and enhanced operational performance.},

	abstract = {Sustainability recognizes the interdependence of ecological, social, and economic systems -- the three pillars of sustainability. The definition of corporate social responsibility ({CSR}) often advocates ethical behavior with respect to these systems. As more corporations commit to sustainability and {CSR} policies, there is increasing pressure to consider social impacts throughout the supply chain. This paper reviews metrics, indicators, and frameworks of social impacts and initiatives relative to their ability to evaluate the social sustainability of supply chains. Then, the relationship between business decision-making and social sustainability is explored with attention initially focused on directly impacting national level measures. A general strategy for considering measures of social sustainability is proposed, and a variety of indicators of {CSR} are described. Several of these indicators are then employed in an example to demonstrate how they may be applied to supply chain decision-making.},

During the past 20 years, there has been growing pressure on businesses to pay more attention to the environmental and resource consequences of the products and services they offer and the processes they deploy. One symptom of this pressure is the movement towards triple bottom line reporting (3BL) concerning the relationship of profit, people, and the planet. The resulting challenges include integrating environmental, health, and safety concerns with green-product design, lean and green operations, and closed-loop supply chains. We review these and other ``sustainability'' themes covered in the first 50 issues of Production and Operations Management and conclude with some thoughts on future research challenges in sustainable operations management.},

@article{stevenson_modern_2018,
	abstract = {Purpose

The purpose of this study is to examine how organisations report on the detection and remediation of modern slavery in their operations and supply chains and to understand their approaches to disclosing information in response to modern slavery legislation.

Design/methodology/approach

An analysis of secondary data based on the statements is released in response to the 2015 {UK} Modern Slavery Act by 101 firms in the clothing and textiles sector.

Findings

Many firms use the same practices to detect and remediate modern slavery as for other social issues. But the hidden, criminal nature of modern slavery and the involvement of third party labour agencies mean practices need to either be tailored or other more innovative approaches developed, including in collaboration with traditional and non-traditional actors. Although five broad types of disclosure are identified, there is substantial heterogeneity in the statements. It is posited however that firms will converge on a more homogenous set of responses over time.

Research limitations/implications

The study is limited to one industry, responses to {UK} legislation and the information disclosed by focal firms only. Future research could expand the focus to include other industries, country contexts and stakeholders.

Practical implications

Managers must consider how their own firm's behaviour contributes to the modern slavery threat, regulates both their stock and non-stock supply chains and ensures modern slavery is elevated from the procurement function to the boardroom. In making disclosures, managers may trade-off the potential competitive gains of transparency against the threat of information leakage and reputational risk should their statements be falsified. The managers should also consider what signals their statements send back up the chain to (sub-)suppliers. Findings also have potential policy implications.

Originality/value

The study expands the authors' understanding of: modern slavery from a supply chain perspective, e.g. identifying the importance of standard setting and risk avoidance; and, supply chain information disclosure in response to legislative demands. This is the first academic paper to examine the statements produced by organisations in response to the {UK} Modern Slavery Act.},

@article{benstead_horizontal_2018,
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate how horizontal collaboration aids organisations in responding to modern slavery legislation and in gaining a socially sustainable competitive advantage.,Action research has been conducted in the textiles and fashion industry and a relational perspective adopted to interpret five collaborative initiatives taken to tackle modern slavery (e.g. joint training and supplier audits). The primary engagement has been with a multi-billion pound turnover company and its collaborations with 35 brands/retailers. A non-government organisation and a trade body have also participated.,Successful horizontal collaboration is dependent on both relational capital and effective (formal and informal) governance mechanisms. In collaborating, firms have generated relational rents and reduced costs creating a socially sustainable competitive advantage, as suggested by the relational perspective. Yet, limits to horizontal collaboration also exist.,The focus is on one industry only, hence there is scope to extend the study to other industries or forms of collaboration taking place across industries.,Successful horizontal collaborative relationships rely on actors having a similar mindset and being able to decouple the commercial and sustainability agendas, especially when direct competitors are involved. Further, working with non-business actors can facilitate collaboration and provide knowledge and resources important for overcoming the uncertainty that is manifest when responding to new legislation.,Social sustainability improvements aim to enhance ethical trade and benefit vulnerable workers.,Prior literature has focussed on vertical collaboration with few prior studies of horizontal collaboration, particularly in a socially sustainable supply chain context. Moreover, there has been limited research into modern slavery from a supply chain perspective. Both successful and unsuccessful initiatives are studied, providing insights into (in)effective collaboration.},

	abstract = {This article shows how the ethical framing of the contemporary issue of modern slavery has evolved in {UK} construction, a sector in which there is a high risk of labor exploitation. It also examines how these framing dynamics have inhibited the emergence of a common framework of action to deal with the issue. We draw on both framing theory and the literature on the discursive construction of moral legitimacy. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that actors seeking to shape the debate bring their own moral schemes to justify and construct the legitimacy of their frames. Actors cluster their views around five evolving frames: human rights issue (later shifting to hidden crime), moral issue, management issue (later shifting to human moral obligation), social justice issue, and decent work issue---which promote particular normative evaluations of what the issue is, who is responsible, and recommendations for action. Our study contributes to a dynamic and political understanding of the meaning making of modern slavery. We identify the antecedents and conditions that have forestalled the emergence of new patterns of action to tackle modern slavery in the {UK} construction sector thereby evidencing the effects of the interplay of morally competing frames on field-level change.},

Y2K passed seemingly without incident, though the widespread disruptions caused by fuel protests and then Foot and Mouth Disease in the {UK}, and by terrorist attacks on the {USA} have underlined the vulnerability of modern supply chains. Despite increasing awareness among practitioners, the concepts of supply chain vulnerability and its managerial counterpart supply chain risk management are still in their infancy. This paper seeks to identify an agenda for future research and to that end the authors go on to clarify the concept of supply chain risk management and to provide a working definition. The existing literature on supply chain vulnerability and risk management is reviewed and compared with findings from exploratory interviews undertaken to discover practitioners' perceptions of supply chain risk and current supply chain risk management strategies.},

	abstract = {This paper develops an operational perspective of supply chain sustainability, by considering it as a risk management process. It explores the nature of sustainability-related supply chain risks, distinguishes them from typical supply chain risks and develops an analytical process for their management. An empirical study is conducted to generate insights about how sustainability-related risks should be managed in an integrated way. A mixed method approach is adopted for data collection and analysis. Through an extensive literature review and personal interviews, 30 risks across the three main pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) are identified first. A large survey across different industrial sectors and two exploratory empirical case studies in two textile manufacturing companies are subsequently conducted to assess and analyse several dimensions of sustainability-related risk. The failure mode and effect analysis ({FMEA}) technique is utilised to assess the relative importance of the selected risks, to identify their potential causes and effects and test potential correlations between the identified risks. Based on the findings of the study, risk treatment strategies are proposed for all the identified sustainability-related supply chain risks. The findings show that endogenous environmental risks are perceived to be the most important across different industries and the interconnectedness between several sustainability-related risks is very high. This points to the need for integrated sustainability risk management approaches to facilitate the development of effective sustainable strategies.},

In this introduction to the 2021 Emerging Discourse Incubator, ``Managing Working Conditions in Supply Chains: Towards Decent Work,'' we argue that the trajectory of this research may be insufficient for addressing decent work. This is due to four characteristics of the extant literature---buyer-centrism, product-centrism, techno-centrism, and social-centrism. As an alternative, we offer ways to `humanize' research on working conditions in supply chains across four dimensions: actors, issues, contexts, and methods. Through humanization, supply chain research has the potential to make a significant scholarly impact as well as to contribute to the realization of decent work in supply chains. We use our proposed path forward as a lens to elaborate on the core contributions of the four invited papers in the Emerging Discourse Incubator.},

This is expected to change as civil society activism and new legislation increase the risk of litigation and reputational damage to supply chain partners. To deal with and combat modern slavery in the supply chain, a theory inspired social supply chain management framework consisting of indicators and countermeasures of modern slavery in the supply chain is developed. The framework is refined in a qualitative expert interview study. The theoretical framework is then evaluated by a multimethod empirical analysis that includes a multicase study based on publicly available supply chain data from 6000 media articles and company websites as well as a quantitative empirical study based on survey data from 280 corporate sustainability experts operating in global supply networks. The results show that economic, political-legal, social, and environmental factors have a significant impact on contemporary slavery in the supply chain. The study also motivates supply chain partners to use preventative and detective measures to reduce the probability of encountering modern slavery actions in their supply chain. Theoretical and managerial implications are drawn from the findings, pointing to a holistic approach to combatting modern slavery in the supply chain.},

	abstract = {While the efforts by actors on the buyer-side of value chains -- such as brands and retailers -- to address upstream labour abuses are well documented, there is a lack of research into how actors on the production-side of value chains -- such as raw material producers -- can identify and address downstream labour risks. This research presents the findings of an action research project that focused on the Australian cotton industry. By applying a sense-making lens, we propose four properties that can be used to identify labour risk in global value chains, providing insights into the capacity of producers to address downstream labour abuses. We suggest that there is a possibility for a `book-end' approach that combines upstream and downstream actions by buyers and producers in global value chains.},

	abstract = {This paper explores sustainability within supply chain management and its link towards resilience through the lens of ethics. The wicked problem of sustainability impacts supply chains and society at large, and the ability of supply chains to remain viable in the future is based on the sustainability of business practices. The paper argues that a substantive proportion of sustainability mechanisms (such as the Triple Bottom Line approach and codes of conducts) can be viewed within the ethical paradigm of deontology, whereby the morality of an action is based on adherence to rules. However, there are numerous critiques of such approaches and their success in creating more sustainable practices. Therefore, the paper proposes there is a need for systems thinking approaches to be incorporated into the exploration of the link between ethics, sustainability and supply chain resilience. Using two examples of social sustainability issues in Australia -- modern slavery legislation and horticultural

 worker exploitation -- the paper demonstrates the utility of various systems thinking methodologies to explore the complexity of these issues. The paper sets out a conceptual call to arms for researchers and practitioners to apply a holistic lens towards how the morality of actions is shaped and influences supply chain sustainability practices.},

This study refers to the industrial upgrading potential of global {SCs} to explain how leveraging enabling technologies for {TfS} may help to improve the triple-bottom-line ({TBL}) performance of the actors in the broad ecosystem while reducing the risks associated to those technologies. Thus, {TfS} can contribute to (S){SCM} and to {TBL} sustainability within and beyond {SC} boundaries.,This study conceptually frames (S){SCM} exploring {TfS} as a meta-capability and contributes to the underexplored question of how to achieve sustainability in global {SCs}.},

	abstract = {Supply chain risk management ({SCRM}) literature is heterogeneous. While much attention has been given to the economic and environmental dimensions, the social dimension has so far received less focus. Thus, this study analyzes the social risks involved in the agri-food supply chains ({AFSCs}) of Argentina and China by employing an integrated approach. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data, followed by using a combination of three complementary data analysis methods: thematic analysis to identify social risks, total interpretive structural modeling ({TISM}) to build interrelationships among the identified social risks, and fuzzy {MICMAC} (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification analysis) to cluster social risks into four categories. Next, we conducted a comparative analysis between the two countries. Theoretical contributions are mainly threefold. First, we identified various social risks involved in the {AFSCs} of Argentina and China, including those just touched on by scholars, such as cultural issues, government's weak monitoring system, the power differential between managers and subordinates, inappropriate disposal of agrichemical containers, and the lack of basic literacy skills. Second, we believe that our study is the first to establish connections among the identified {AFSC} social risks, which represents the originality of this work. Third, we discover that cultural issues is the key risk that has the highest capability to elicit other social risks involved in the {AFSCs}. Our work extends scholarship's knowledge to understand {AFSC} social risks from the cultural perspective. This study also generates contributions to policymakers, migrant associations, and the government tax departments of Argentina and China.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Sustainability-related risk management of logistics service providers ({LSPs}) is an essential part of sustainability performance of focal companies, as logistics services touch the entire supply chain ({SC}) -- from raw material sources to end-customers. The purpose of this paper, draws on resource-based view and stakeholder theory in exploring how companies can manage environmental and social sustainability-related risks from logistics service suppliers. This kind of capability is essential in order to maintain reputation in the eyes of stakeholders, and to maintain long-term financial performance.
The data of this multiple-case study were collected from semi-structured interviews in eight case-companies in Finland. Five of the cases are primary logistics buyers, and three represent {LSP} companies.
The cross-case analysis showed that primary buyers of logistics services use their sustainability criteria as a prerequisite for {LSP} candidates, and when the level is adequate and equal, other factors, e.g. price and capacity, are decisive. Based on the analysis, large {LSPs} are preparing for the future competition, and act in a more sustainable manner than their customers (buyers) expect at the moment, while small {LSPs} strictly comply with the regulation. However, buyers' requirements for sustainable logistics services are increasing as the stakeholder expectations for comprehensively sustainable {SCs} are growing.
Only little research has been conducted on sustainable logistics from the buyer company's risk management perspective. This paper adds the knowledge of sustainability-related risk management in purchasing of logistics services and in the logistics industry.},

The issue of human rights in business is gaining importance both in the context of legal regulations and the approach of enterprises. Nevertheless, human rights in supply chains pose many challenges. This issue should be particularly important to companies that have decided to implement social responsibility. Two crucial research questions were asked. First, to what extent do socially responsible companies pay attention to human rights issues in supply chains? Second, if human rights issues are managed in supply chains, how is this done? The main results show that this issue is considered, but it is difficult to unequivocally assess to what extent the subject of human rights is treated strategically as an element of a business case and how far it results from the current need to be adjusted to the present societal expectations. This article outlines the general overview of the situation.},

A case study of Indian petroleum supply chain ({PSC}) has been illustrated to explain the proposed method.,The results of this study found that transportation/logistics (delivery system), quality of the petroleum products, crude supply, customer's order and legal/political regulations are the most significant risk drivers of a typical {PSC}. It is also found that the Indian {PSC} possesses a risk score of 34 percent.,The quantification of risk in operational measure provides an unblemished representation of the overall {SC} risk. Unlike the existing financial measure, it takes complex subjective operational effectiveness like product quality, customer satisfaction, etc., into consideration. Identifying the high-prioritized risks helps the decision and policy makers to merely focus on the most prominent risk drivers, and reduce the impact of overall {SC} risk. Planning a risk mitigation strategy at a given level of risk is however beyond the scope of this research.,The paper develops a risk quantification framework in the context of a {PSC}.},

@article{hou_toward_2021,
	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of the paper is to develop a methodological framework for supply chain risk management using the hierarchical holographic modeling approach. It analyses supply chain risks in a systematic manner and develops a hierarchical methodology for identifying, prioritizing and managing the potential supply chain risks.
Design/methodology/approach
This research reviews supply chain risk management literature and develops a conceptual framework, which outlines general principles and guidelines for managing risks in a systematic manner. Through decomposition, the complexity of supply chain risk can be identified by analyzing smaller subsystems.
Findings
The paper provides a conceptual framework to identify supply chain risks from multiple overlapping perspectives. The structured filtering and ranking procedure enables decision-makers to focus on the most critical risks. The research shows that the supply chain risks associated with the sub-systems within the hierarchical structure contribute to and ultimately determine the risks of the overall supply chain system.
Research limitations/implications
The risks associated with each sub system within the hierarchical structure can contribute to and determine the risks of the overall supply chain system. Further applications in various companies and industry sectors would benefit supply chain managers on a case-by-case basis.
Practical implications
The hierarchical risk identification framework can serve as guidance for applications to specific supply chain systems and processes. The framework from a holistic overlapping perspective can efficiently and effectively help supply chain managers identify supply chain risks and facilitate the evaluation of the subsystem risks.
Originality/value
The paper applies system thinking in supply chain management and presents an efficient and practical framework for supply chain risk identification and evaluation.},

	abstract = {Purpose
- This conceptual paper aims to examine modern slavery in the supply chain, showing how the issue challenges conventional thinking and practice in corporate social responsibility ({CSR}).
Design/methodology/approach
- The paper considers the differences between modern slavery and other concerns within {CSR}. It examines legal attempts to encourage supply chain transparency and the use of corporate {CSR} methods. An example of forced labour in {UK} agriculture is used to develop a critique of these approaches. The paper examines the challenges facing research in this important area.
Findings
- The paper shows that the distinctive characteristics of modern slavery may make conventional supply chain {CSR} practices relatively ineffective. A holistic perspective may be needed in future research.
Research limitations/implications
- Researchers need to focus less on the espoused policies of corporations, and more on the enacted practice.
Social implications
- Modern slavery is universally accepted as a shameful blight on society; firms' supply chain practices may be part of the problem.
Originality/value
- The paper's contribution is to point to the potential differences between modern slavery and other {CSR}-related issues and to highlight the paradox that firms' approaches to the issue may run in parallel with actions that foster the problem in the first place.},
