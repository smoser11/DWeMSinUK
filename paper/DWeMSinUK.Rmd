# ONE: Conceptualization and Population (=Setting)

The population is DW in the UK (who have a mobile phone during survey fielding = 2023?)


Idea 1:  



# TWO: 




## ISSUES

### Data

#### Numbers:

<https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-groups/6231>

<https://www.bics.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RR2021.pdf>


#### Data-cleaning:

- "Don't know"s -> `NA`s
- Zero (DW) personal network and inconsistencies re: referral


### Results

- Do we believe them?
	- 
- Check convergence; perform sensitivity tests (e.g. priors) (SJM)
- Disconnected network: dissagregatge by origin (UK, Philapeno, Latinx?)

## Analysis

### Descriptive statistics 

Below are three examples that indicate that the high estimate for modern slavery makes sense. A high percentage of domestic workers suffer from exploitation.

Q36. How much are you paid an hour?
41% of respondents are paid below the National Minimum Wage of £10.42. 

Q80. Have you or someone you know personally been advised to enter the NRM? 
62% of respondents said they, or they know someone who was advised to enter the NRM. 
36% of respondents were themselves advised to the NRM.

Q62. How often do you feel you work more than excessively? 
72% of respondents have experienced excessive working (always, often or sometimes). 
14.4% of respondents reported to have “always” worked excessively. 


### Model-based Inferences

CITE RDS and CRAN:  @RDSA


1. Start with SS-PSE of http://hpmrg.org/sspse/ then add the 'visability' aspect as per @mcla23-modeling .

- NOTE: `posteriorsize()` this is just based on personal-network size (<http://hpmrg.org/sspse/>)
	- http://www.respondentdrivensampling.org/  and @gile2010-respondent
	- See @hand14-estimating  Handcock MS. size: Estimating Population Size from Discovery Models using Successive Sampling Data, Hard-to-Reach Population Methods Research Group, Los Angeles, CA R package version 0.20. 2011 
2. Full Bayesian inference using successive sampling as in @gile11-improving @gile15-network, @volt08-probability, 
	- Note: why is `N` (=estimated population size) required?  Not in papers?  But @gile15-diagnostics

no, it is.  try this:
RDS estimates: old (VH, SH)
and New (SS and MA) and comparison/ discussion






3. NSUM with RDS weights as in eqn XX in @feehXX-







This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
