Inference from such data requires specialized techniques because the sampling process is both partially beyond the control of the researcher, and partially implicitly defined. Therefore, it is not generally possible to compute the sampling weights for traditional design-based inference directly, and likelihood inference requires modelling the complex sampling process. As an alternative, we introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in a design-based estimator leveraging a working network model. We derive a new class of estimators for population means and a corresponding bootstrap standard error estimator. We demonstrate improved performance compared with existing estimators, including adjustment for an initial convenience sample. We also apply the method and an extension to the estimation of the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in a high-risk population.","2015","2022-12-17 11:52:36","2023-11-25 17:20:30","2022-12-17 11:52:36","619-639","","3","178","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","tex.ids= gile15-networka _eprint: https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/rssa.12091","","/Users/sm38679/Zotero/storage/GUQ9H4ZA/Gile and Handcock - 2015 - Network model-assisted inference from respondent-driven.pdf; /Users/sm38679/Zotero/storage/NCTLDTQS/rssa.html","","_tablet; RDS","Social networks; Network sampling; Hard-to-reach population sampling; Exponential family random graph model; Link tracing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its use by leading health organizations, the performance of this method in realistic situations is still largely unknown. We evaluated respondent-driven sampling by comparing estimates from a respondent-driven sampling survey with total population data. Methods: Total population data on age, tribe, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual activity, and HIV status were available on a population of 2402 male household heads from an open cohort in rural Uganda. A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey was carried out in this population, using current methods of sampling (RDS sample) and statistical inference (RDS estimates). Analyses were carried out for the full RDS sample and then repeated for the first 250 recruits (small sample). Results: We recruited 927 household heads. Full and small RDS samples were largely representative of the total population, but both samples underrepresented men who were younger, of higher socio-economic status, and with unknown sexual activity and HIV status. Respondent-driven sampling statistical inference methods failed to reduce these biases. Only 31%—37% (depending on method and sample size) of RDS estimates were closer to the true population proportions than the RDS sample proportions. Only 50%—74% of respondent-driven sampling bootstrap 95% confidence intervals included the population proportion. Conclusions: Respondent-driven sampling produced a generally representative sample of this well-connected nonhidden population. However, current respondent-driven sampling inference methods failed to reduce bias when it occurred. Whether the data required to remove bias and measure precision can be collected in a respondent-driven sampling survey is unresolved. Respondent-driven sampling should be regarded as a (potentially superior) form of convenience sampling method, and caution is required when interpreting findings based on the sampling method.","2012","2023-04-25 11:34:42","2023-11-25 17:21:58","2023-04-25 11:34:42","138-147","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","tex.ids= mccr12-evaluationa publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","","/Users/sm38679/Zotero/storage/RGQ6JTIC/McCreesh et al - 2012 - Evaluation of Respondent-driven Sampling.pdf","","RDS; Hidden population sampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design is based on selecting initial samples at random and then adaptively tracing links to add new members. The inferential procedure involves the Rao–Blackwell theorem applied to a sufficient statistic markedly different from the usual one that arises in sampling from a finite population. The strategy involves a combination of link-tracing and mark-recapture estimation methods. An empirical application is described. The result demonstrates that the strategy can efficiently incorporate adaptively selected members of the sample into the inferential procedure.
