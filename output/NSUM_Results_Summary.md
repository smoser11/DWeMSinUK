| Excessive Hours | 29,248 (18,064 - 53,994) | 2.98% (1.84% - 5.51%) |
| Access to Help | 19,885 (6,540 - 47,818) | 2.03% (0.67% - 4.88%) |

#### MBSU (Conservative Adjustment) - δ=0.8, τ=0.7, ρ=1.0

| Indicator | Estimate (95% CI) | Prevalence |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Document Withholding | 14,500 (3,969 - 41,873) | 1.48% (0.40% - 4.27%) |
| Pay Issues | 38,499 (25,439 - 76,102) | 3.93% (2.60% - 7.77%) |
| Threats/Abuse | 35,966 (24,834 - 78,446) | 3.67% (2.53% - 8.00%) |
| Excessive Hours | 39,955 (24,677 - 73,760) | 4.08% (2.52% - 7.53%) |
| Access to Help | 27,165 (8,934 - 65,323) | 2.77% (0.91% - 6.67%) |

### Key Findings

- **Prevalence Range**: Estimates range from 0.83% to 4.08% across all indicators and adjustment methods
- **Conservative vs. Baseline**: Conservative adjustments yield estimates ~1.8x higher than unadjusted
- **Moderate vs. Baseline**: Moderate adjustments yield estimates ~1.3x higher than unadjusted
- **Highest Risk**: Excessive working hours shows highest prevalence (2.3-4.1% depending on adjustment)
- **Lowest Risk**: Document withholding shows lowest prevalence (0.8-1.5% depending on adjustment)

## Appendix: Sensitivity Analyses

### Appendix Table A1: Bootstrap Method Comparison
All bootstrap methods (neighborhood, tree, chain, SS) produce nearly identical point estimates, with variation only in confidence interval widths. This demonstrates robustness to bootstrap method choice.

### Appendix Table A2: Weight Method Comparison
VH and SS weights produce identical results, confirming both methods appropriately account for RDS sampling design.

### Appendix Table A3: Population Size Sensitivity
Absolute estimates scale linearly with population size (50K, 100K, 980K, 1.74M) while prevalence rates remain constant, validating the estimation approach.

### Appendix Table A4: NSUM Method Comparison
Comparison of MBSU (with three adjustment levels) and GNSUM Symmetric shows:
- GNSUM estimates match MBSU (No Adjustment) exactly for all indicators
- Conservative MBSU adjustments produce highest estimates
- Moderate MBSU adjustments provide intermediate values

## Integration into Paper

### Section 5.2.3: NSUM Estimates

Replace placeholder text with results from `generate_paper_text.R` output. Include Table 6 using the Quarto code chunk provided.

### Section 5.3: Method Comparison

Compare NSUM estimates (Table 6) with RDS estimates from earlier sections. Key points:
- Both methods show similar prevalence ranges (1-4%)
- RDS provides ego-centric perspective (respondent's own experiences)
- NSUM provides alter-centric perspective (experiences known in network)
- Confidence intervals overlap substantially, suggesting consistency

### Appendix: Robustness Checks

Include Appendix Tables A1-A4 with text from `generate_paper_text.R` demonstrating robustness to methodological choices.

## Interpretation Notes

### Adjustment Factors

**δ (Transmission/Barrier Effect)**: Proportion of exploitation cases visible to network members
- δ=1.0: No visibility barriers (baseline)
- δ=0.9: 10% of cases hidden from networks (moderate)
- δ=0.8: 20% of cases hidden from networks (conservative)

**τ (Recall Effect)**: Accuracy of reporting known cases
- τ=1.0: Perfect recall (baseline)
- τ=0.85: 15% underreporting (moderate)
- τ=0.7: 30% underreporting (conservative)

**ρ (Known Network Correction)**: Adjustment for network size accuracy
- ρ=1.0: Network sizes accurate (all scenarios)

### Recommended Main Text Approach

Use **MBSU (Moderate)** as primary estimates:
- Acknowledges likely visibility/reporting barriers
- More realistic than unadjusted baseline
- Less extreme than conservative scenario
- Provides middle ground for policy discussions

Report all three scenarios in Table 6 to show sensitivity to assumptions, with moderate adjustment as reference case in text.
