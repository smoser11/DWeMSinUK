Hello, Carolyn. This is Scott. I apologize for missing our Monday meeting. I've been buried in administrative duties on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and then returned to the endless marking. I’ve done some work and wanted to update you, but my typing is poor and my spelling even worse. So I thought it would be quicker to send you a recording. I tried to organize my thoughts somewhat, so here’s where I’m at and what I hoped to discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed that.

To begin, I’ve been reconsidering the conceptualization and population aspects of our study, which I’ll refer to as the setting. The first question is, what is the population? I think we have a clear answer: domestic workers in the UK. More specifically, it’s domestic workers in the UK who have a mobile phone during the survey fielding period, or perhaps those who have had a mobile phone in the calendar year preceding the survey.

If that’s our population, which I believe it is and it’s well-defined, then the target population, or the hidden population, so to speak, would be domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone and have experienced exploitation or modern slavery in the past 12 months. There are several ways we can operationalize this. You and Salim, with a little input from me, have developed three very principled methods to do so.

The first two are dichotomous variables. The first is Question 36, dichotomized to ask if respondents are paid less than the legal minimum wage. The second is Question 80, also dichotomized, which asks if they have been through the national referral mechanism or been referred to it. To my mind, these are high bars. If someone truthfully answers "yes" to either of these questions, I think we can be confident that they are indeed part of the hidden population. I’m not an expert in this area, but that seems reasonable to me.

We also discussed—and you and Salim mainly developed—a continuous measure. This third idea is conceptually different. You developed a series of indicators, something like eight, twelve, or sixteen, and normalized them to calculate how many of these indicators a person satisfies, possibly with weighting. This results in a number between zero and one, representing the person’s risk of experiencing modern slavery.

If we use that as a continuous measure—not measuring whether someone has experienced modern slavery, but rather their risk of experiencing it—it may seem like splitting hairs, but methodologically and conceptually, these are quite different approaches. If we claim to measure the risk of exposure, then the hidden population needs to be redefined. In this case, the population we’re sampling from would still be domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, but everyone in that population would have some level of risk for experiencing modern slavery, even if that risk is zero. I think this conceptual distinction is important.

So, that’s where I started. We have the population, the target population, and now we need to discuss the sampling. Where is this data coming from? We spent some time on this, and although the conclusion might not be what we wanted, I think it’s productive. We have a convenience sample through a Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) method. This involves sampling domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, starting with initial seeds and then branching out using RDS with five coupons. This isn’t exactly a snowball sampling method but a modified version.

Again, these are my beliefs, so please correct me if I’m wrong. This is the data we have to work with, so the question is, what do we do with it?

One additional aspect to consider about the sample is that it functionally comes from three subgroups within the population: people from the Philippines, Latinx individuals, and British-born individuals. We might say there are three distinct clusters based on nationality, which I think we could assert with some confidence.

Now, moving on to data issues, specifically, do we know anything about the size of the population? I found two sources: one is an official UK site, nationalcareers.service.gov.uk, with job groupings, possibly based on census data, and the other is from an organization called BICS. These provide some estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK, depending on how we define it—whether it includes home cleaning, daycare, institutionalized work, etc. This is just a preliminary exploration.

We could also estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from your RDS sample. One of the survey questions asks how many other domestic workers the respondent knows in the UK. This could help estimate the population size. I’m currently exploring this, but it’s yielding some strange results—like the population estimate being too small and the computation taking too long.

So, regarding analysis, the first step is to take it from the literature—specifically, using the SSPS method by Guile et al. This is the successive sampling population size estimate, which is state-of-the-art. It uses the wave at which a respondent appears in the sample as additional information, which helps mitigate biases present in earlier RDS methods. We can apply this to estimate proportions within the population who are part of the hidden population, based on whether they meet the criteria of modern slavery, as defined by Questions 36 or 80.

One thing I should mention, and much appreciation to Salim for his work, is the issue of handling “don’t know” responses. Currently, these are coded as negative responses, but an alternative is to treat them as missing data, which could slightly increase the estimated proportion of domestic workers experiencing modern slavery.

There’s also the issue of respondents who report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK but then provide referrals, which is a logical inconsistency. We may need to adjust these zeros to something positive, possibly by adding one to everyone’s reported degree, although this approach isn’t principled.

Regarding results, the preliminary estimates suggest that 30-40% of domestic workers in the UK are experiencing modern slavery, which seems high but is consistent with the data. We can run sensitivity analyses and explore further robustness checks.

In terms of presentation, I’m not in a position to produce publication-ready graphics at the moment, but I’d appreciate discussing how we want to present these findings—whether through tables, graphs, confidence intervals, etc.

This is what I hoped to report and discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed the meeting, but I hope this recording conveys the key points. I’ll try to send along a summary transcript as well.

### Critique of the Previous Response

The previous response provides a well-structured and grammatically correct version of the voice memo, but it can be enhanced with more specific examples and details. Here are areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of Specific Examples**:

    * The response discusses general concepts like “don’t know” responses and logical inconsistencies but doesn’t provide specific examples from the data or how these issues might affect the analysis.
    * More concrete details about the data and examples of how the estimates were derived would strengthen the explanation.
2. **Clarification of Statistical Techniques**:

    * The mention of SSPS, RDS, and other statistical techniques could be more detailed, explaining their relevance and application to this specific dataset.
    * The response could benefit from a brief explanation of how these methods will be used and why they are appropriate for the analysis at hand.
3. **Data Issues and Their Impact**:

    * The response mentions data issues like logical inconsistencies but doesn’t elaborate on the potential impact these issues could have on the results.
    * Including specific examples of how these issues were identified and the steps taken to address them would add clarity.
4. **Details on Presentation and Outputs**:

    * The response briefly touches on presentation but doesn’t specify what kinds of tables, graphs, or figures would be most useful.
    * More specific suggestions on how to present the results and what outputs would be expected in the final report or publication would be helpful.

You developed a series of indicators, something like eight, twelve, or sixteen, and normalized them to calculate how many of these indicators a person satisfies, possibly with weighting. This results in a number between zero and one, representing the person’s risk of experiencing modern slavery.

For example, suppose an individual meets five out of twelve indicators, and those indicators have varying weights based on their severity. In that case, the final risk score might be 0.4 or 0.6, reflecting their relative risk compared to others in the population. If we use that as a continuous measure—not measuring whether someone has experienced modern slavery, but rather their risk of experiencing it—it may seem like splitting hairs, but methodologically and conceptually, these are quite different approaches. If we claim to measure the risk of exposure, then the hidden population needs to be redefined.

We spent some time on this, and although the conclusion might not be what we wanted, I think it’s productive. We have a convenience sample through a Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) method. This involves sampling domestic workers in the UK who have a cell phone, starting with initial seeds and then branching out using RDS with five coupons. This isn’t exactly a snowball sampling method but a modified version.

For instance, let’s say we start with a group of domestic workers who have been identified through NGOs. They serve as the initial seeds, each given five coupons to recruit others. As this process continues, we accumulate a networked sample representing the broader population of domestic workers in the UK with mobile phones.

Again, these are my beliefs, so please correct me if I’m wrong. This is the data we have to work with, so the question is, what do we do with it?

One additional aspect to consider about the sample is that it functionally comes from three subgroups within the population: people from the Philippines, Latinx individuals, and British-born individuals. We might say there are three distinct clusters based on nationality, which I think we could assert with some confidence. For example, if 40% of our sample is Filipina, 30% Latinx, and 30% British-born, these clusters could be analyzed separately to identify differences in their risk levels or experiences of modern slavery.

Now, moving on to data issues, specifically, do we know anything about the size of the population? I found two sources: one is an official UK site, nationalcareers.service.gov.uk, with job groupings, possibly based on census data, and the other is from an organization called BICS. These provide some estimates of the number of domestic workers in the UK, depending on how we define it—whether it includes home cleaning, daycare, institutionalized work, etc. This is just a preliminary exploration.

We could also estimate the number of domestic workers in the UK from your RDS sample. One of the survey questions asks how many other domestic workers the respondent knows in the UK. For example, if the average respondent knows 10 other domestic workers, and we have 100 respondents, this could give us a rough estimate of the total population size. However, I’m currently exploring this, but it’s yielding some strange results—like the population estimate being too small and the computation taking too long.

So, regarding analysis, the first step is to take it from the literature—specifically, using the SSPS method by Guile et al. This is the successive sampling population size estimate, which is state-of-the-art. It uses the wave at which a respondent appears in the sample as additional information, which helps mitigate biases present in earlier RDS methods. For example, if a respondent with a large social network joins in the third wave, this information helps adjust the overall population estimates, considering the size of their network and when they were recruited. We can apply this to estimate proportions within the population who are part of the hidden population, based on whether they meet the criteria of modern slavery, as defined by Questions 36 or 80.

One thing I should mention, and much appreciation to Salim for his work, is the issue of handling “don’t know” responses. For example, if a respondent answers “I don’t know” to whether they’ve been referred to the national referral mechanism, the current approach is to code this as a negative response. However, an alternative is to treat these as missing data, which could slightly increase the estimated proportion of domestic workers experiencing modern slavery. Specifically, if we treat “don’t know” responses as missing and exclude them from the analysis, the overall proportion might increase from, say, 35% to 38%, due to the exclusion of ambiguous responses.

There’s also the issue of respondents who report knowing zero domestic workers in the UK but then provide referrals, which is a logical inconsistency. For example, if someone claims to know zero domestic workers but then provides contact information for two others, this inconsistency needs to be addressed. We may need to adjust these zeros to something positive, possibly by adding one to everyone’s reported degree, although this approach isn’t principled.

Regarding results, the preliminary estimates suggest that 30-40% of domestic workers in the UK are experiencing modern slavery, which seems high but is consistent with the data. We can run sensitivity analyses and explore further robustness checks. For example, we might compare the results using different prior assumptions about the population size or alternative methods for handling missing data.

In terms of presentation, I’m not in a position to produce publication-ready graphics at the moment, but I’d appreciate discussing how we want to present these findings—whether through tables, graphs, confidence intervals, etc. For instance, we could include a table summarizing the risk scores across different subgroups, a graph showing the distribution of risk scores, and confidence intervals for the estimated proportions of the hidden population.

This is what I hoped to report and discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed

This is what I hoped to report and discuss with you on Monday. Again, I’m sorry I missed the meeting, but I hope this recording conveys the key points. I’ll try to send along a summary transcript as well.

### Further Considerations and Next Steps

**Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis**:

* We should consider conducting a robustness analysis to ensure that our results hold under different assumptions. For example, we could vary the assumptions about the size of the hidden population or test the sensitivity of our estimates to different methods of handling missing data or "don’t know" responses.
* Additionally, it might be valuable to explore alternative models or techniques, such as Bayesian hierarchical models, which could provide more nuanced insights into the variability of risk across different subgroups.

**Use of Network Data**:

* Since our study heavily relies on Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), it’s essential to maximize the information we extract from the network data. Specifically, we should explore methods that leverage the connections within the network to improve our population estimates. For example, we could use network imputation techniques to fill in missing connections or apply advanced RDS estimators that account for network structure.
* There’s also the potential to use network visualization tools to map out the connections between respondents and highlight key influencers or hubs within the network. These visualizations could be powerful tools for both analysis and presentation.

**Presentation and Reporting**:

* For the final report or publication, I suggest including the following:
    * **Tables**: Summarize key demographic characteristics of the sample, the distribution of risk scores, and the estimated proportions of the hidden population by subgroup (e.g., Filipino, Latinx, British-born).
    * **Figures**: Include graphs that display the distribution of risk scores, the convergence of the SSPS estimates, and network diagrams that illustrate the structure of the respondent-driven sample.
    * **Appendices**: Provide detailed methodological appendices that explain the statistical techniques used, the handling of missing data, and any robustness checks performed.

**Collaboration and Next Steps**:

* I’m excited to continue working on this project and am eager to explore the additional analyses we’ve discussed. I’ll continue refining the estimates and will also begin drafting sections of the manuscript where appropriate.
* I’d also appreciate any feedback you have on the current direction, particularly regarding the handling of the “don’t know” responses and the logical inconsistencies we’ve identified. If you have suggestions for alternative approaches or additional analyses that you think might be valuable, please let me know.

### Conclusion

To wrap up, we’re making good progress, and the preliminary results are both intriguing and important. I believe that by addressing the remaining data issues and refining our analysis, we can produce a robust and impactful study that sheds light on the experiences of domestic workers in the UK, particularly those at risk of modern slavery. I look forward to our continued collaboration and to discussing these findings further with you.

Thanks again for your patience, and I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
Scott

Putting this in 'park':



I think the next steps are as follows:
'Manually' implement the neighborhood bootstrap for RDS inference (Scott);
1a) Oh, there is the remaining issue of the ‘known size’ group.  To do scale-up we need some way to estimate the size of a persons’ social network.  This is usually done by asking ‘How many X do you know?’ and comparing their answer to the know group size of group X (e.g. people named John)  There was some issue we were having about this.  But I think it only matters for NSUM, and not RDS (?)

2) implement whatever the correct equation is from the Feehan and Salgnic (sp?) 2016 to perform NSUM estimation on RDS data (Scott);

3) figure out how to fairly compare estimates from RDS estimation and NSUM estimation. This last part involves finding/creating variables based on the survey codebook that allow for 'proper' comparison of estimates from the two methods (CE and SJM); A key challenge is ensuring a fair comparison between estimates derived from RDS and NSUM. This involves finding or creating variables from the survey codebook that enable a "proper" comparison between the two methods.  E.g. we use Q36 and Q70 as dichotomous variables when performing RDS estimation.   If I am remembering correctly, there is a discrepancy between "egocentric" questions (focused on the respondent's experience) and questions about the respondent's knowledge of others' experiences.  Questions like questions for ‘how many people in H (=the hidden population)’ – e.g. Q33. 5a5 , Q33. 5a7, Q49. 5c6
Q64. 5d11
Q83. 5f16
Q88. 5f16
Q89. 5f15
-- don’t exactly match up with q36 and q80 that we use in the RDS estimation.


4) I had thought we had a discussion about the role of 'social networks' in the two estimation methods (RDS and NSUM). I have a vague memory of talking with CE about how the 'personal network' entered into the different estimation techniques.  Or perhaps it was how model-based and design-based RDS estimators ‘use’ social network data differently.  The main point – I think – was a subtle methodological one but gave some insight into sensitivity to priors/ parameters.

5) There is something about ‘treacherous’ Bayesain posterior distributions(??)

Does any of this ring a bell?  Sorry again for being such a bad co-author on this, Caroline.  I *am* excited to finish it and I *am* (VERY) excited at the prospect of working with you on the Nuffield grant re: domestic servitude.
Would it help to have a conversation in order to put this project in ‘park’ so that we can resume easily when time permits?
