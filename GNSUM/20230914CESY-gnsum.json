{"text": " there you go there you go sorry for being late thanks for tech problems you know how it is but I got all of your documents I've read them in skimmed is probably a more accurate word but I've got my coffee I've got my pen I'm eager to get into it so thank you you're absolutely right with those things that is what we need to work out sorry I'm not arriving with a map saying this is how we we have to proceed I think it's something that we will find our way through the jungle between us I hope so I mean already you're pointing us in the direction of bootstrapping has been invaluable so yeah we really just sort of feeling a way through the next steps to understand who's actually say what to do and who's doing what right yeah that's all I mean it might be an ongoing conversation it might be something we can't bottom now but it probably is a good idea also to discuss sort of time frames that or at least share what we have in our own minds about time frame so that we can see whether whether everything matches together or whether there are going to be problems yeah so yeah so in terms of what's next you talked about the objective and the division of labour well the objective remains really to generate this estimate of the hidden population among domestic workers as far as we are able to and you you can generalize network scale-up methods to do that I mean that's the the overriding objective and then how we do that I mean I think that's a matter of debate we I think as I mentioned in my email have you seen it we've got Selim with us definitely full time until the end of the month so again this comes into the time frame conversation can we make maximum use of Selim's time now and then there's the possibility I mean Selim come in here now if you want to but I believe Selim's keen to continue looking at this yeah so you don't need to share my screen yeah what you don't want to be able to share this so Dr. Moseley you sent this article about the yoke yoke at all pay but who's on 22 for the neighborhood so I've tried to understand it and and also work on it and what I understand is that we need certain points or aspects to perform that bootstrap for our data set and that is like the notes this is the list of our IDs basically and then we have the edges and then we have the trades and degree so all that stuff I have tried to put this down to the Excel spreadsheet I'm going to share it now so you can tell me to what extent it looks cleaned up can you see it yes I can see it thank you very much okay yeah so you're 100% right Selim so the I was thinking about this this morning the the so I did have a quick look at the okay let me take half a step back so by the way Caroline not that you need to hear it for me but kudos your your lit review the document that you sent was really really really spot-on but the so taking a whole step back the the neighborhood boot is it's building on this thing called a tree okay so what's the issue the issue is we want to bootstrapping but we definitely don't have independence here Caroline's you rightly mentioned you know at best we have a convenience sample in our DS so the issue is how do you bootstrapping in these in this setting where you don't have independence whatsoever and so these clever people have different ideas and there's this very very sophisticated and I confess I didn't fully comprehend it but there's this tree method which is meant to anyway doesn't matter then these other people as you both rightly said come along and say actually there's an easier and better way to do this called this neighborhood boot and and you're 100% right Selim that what's crucial here is we need we need we need IDs we need to be able to uniquely identify each respondent and then we need to know who referred who and so usually that that takes the form of what's called an adjacency matrix this is just a graph so you've got the nodes are the are the IDs and so if I'm person 60 and you're a person 41 and I refer you then there's an edge from person 60 to person 41 you get the idea and so on and so forth so that's the sort of the structure of the data well that's one of the that's one component of the data that will need to do this this neighborhood bootstrap that the idea behind the input was really kind of surprising to me that it works so well but it does and we can sit sit site and that's great but the idea is you just take everybody who refers anybody and you just you just sample with replacement them and turns out that works really well it's it's sort of surprisingly simple and and but at least according to the papers it seems to work really really well so so so that's the structure that we need so right so now I'm rambling coffee's just now kicking in sorry so so Selim we need unique IDs for every single every single person and then we need to know who referred who so thank you for sharing your screen so like on line three it's a recruiter so you got node one recruiter and then node two respondent recruit I don't understand can you flush that out for me I can I can walk you through thank you so what we see here are the IDs of the people so for some two is the ID person three four five these are the ID of the people and when when there's written note one that's the recruiter that is 60 so when we scroll down to 60 here we are seeing that is Anna here that would be Anna so Anna has preferred on recruiting the second one so 60 ID 60 has recruited or referred person ID to and when there's no number written this means they haven't recruited they just complete the survey based on the promotion that our NGO partners has forwarded to their to their own people so these are the seeds so this right okay and then we can continue with that for some 41 has recruited 10 and and six these are these other people good good yeah good good good so then that's excellent thank you so then the next step would be to turn that into an adjacency matrix I'm trying to think of the can you if you maybe already have sorry if you have something but could you email me that excel file and I can have a think on the easiest way to reshape this into an adjacency matrix yeah yeah I read and I think there's something like zero and one yeah exactly so where where do we have like where do these connections exist exactly yeah so I will send you the excellent spreadsheet and you will tell me what to do next yeah after a lot more coffee yeah so but just to be clear so this is this is only relevant for the for the bootstrapping which I think we're all on board with is this is the way to go with with these uncertainty estimates the I mean I guess you know we could start with the calculations already right I mean Caroline you're you're I know we call it memo or outline of sort of what how to proceed with the calculations we could we could start with that given the data that we have I think so that protocol that I sent through that had the different sum quantities and actually the sort of the translation of the formula into our from results into fiend and salgonics equations yes yes yes yes yes yes exactly sorry sorry again fresh cup of coffee yeah I mean that would be our sample our original sample data but without the bootstrapping exactly so we would be doing a first pass through with our raw data I don't know I'm using the right terminology as the first the first approach to actually plugging some data in and getting some output yeah that's right so this would just be point estimates without without any kind of uncertainty the end you're right the bootstrapping would be a post hoc or ex post it would come later I think it's gonna I think it's neat I think it's a nice contribution it's as slim as intimated it's gonna take a bit more work to to structure the data in a way that is amenable to doing this neighborhood bootstrap but we can we can we can do that I mean I should have prepared more for this I'm sorry about that I mean drink my coffee oh really it's it's definitely we're feeling our way here so this is definitely a joint process the feelings mutual feelings mutual and please stop you're gonna blush like a like a pink pig if you anyway thank you very much with the feelings mutual I'm very much I guess and again I'm so sorry for my completely scattered emails and behavior this morning a few questions come to mind so I take your point Caroline thank you very much for the the clarity on you know I think we all see what the objective is and the tasks that are required we need to do these calculations we need to get these uncertainty estimates a few questions that popped my mind are things like audience or and I think Salimi mentioned a journal journal so like so what what do we want this paper to look like is this a methods paper is this a substance paper is it a little from column A a little from column B is it you know what what um what what do we want the yeah who do we want the paper to be for I guess is probably better yeah so I'm I'm wondering whether it could go into a modern slavery journal if it isn't a methods paper which I suspect it isn't I think we're not really going to make a contribution to methods we're going to be using methods in an interesting way we hope to produce an output but actually the the interest is in the the application of this method to a particular social situation and which is looking at labor exploitation among domestic workers in the UK and somewhere like the Journal of Modern Slavery might be interested in the application of this method because there have been recommendations from GFMS which is the Global Fund for Ending Modern Slavery that these sorts of techniques ought to be used but as yet there isn't any as far as I'm aware anyone who's tried to do it yeah so that would probably protect us a little bit from the purists who would say well you're really not using your method as appropriate as pristinely as perhaps you could have done but it would perhaps meet the needs of a community for an example of how this method was used but also providing some as you say a little bit of common and a little bit but providing some substance that would be of interest so potentially I mean I don't know whether you're interested in publishing in that sort of journal it's not high-ranking but it is this is sort of it's bread and butter how does that sound oh yeah yeah yeah I'm interested in publishing anywhere I mean not literally anywhere but I mean I'm I'm very very open to I'm not at all purists or snob or anything but yeah that's absolutely fine for me so then I guess the what's next is sort of you know tasks and I think I think you're you're right Caroline that we're yeah we're not gonna make a methodological contribution I think the contribution is applying these techniques to this and you're right I've been I've only seen G and some used in very limited applications and I agree with you I've never seen it for for modern slavery and certainly not modern slavery in the UK so I think that's absolutely a contribution so I guess what's next is as you said times of the essence so yeah who does who does what when well I'm very happy to lead on the writing if that's oh yeah yeah I mean that's what I'm trying to collect in terms of keeping memos of our meeting so that I can generate a methodological section I know Salim and I are just about to publish a report on the descriptive statistics related to this work good so Salim's done quite a lot of work we had our survey checked through by the director of labor market enforcement directors team and they were particularly interested from a descriptive point of view in differences between employment statuses in domestic workers so we have a report coming out we're just talking about the date but we think it'll be the 9th of October that focuses very much on different employment statuses which draws on description descriptive statistics from that so that sort of side has been done good but it I see this work as sort of feeding directly into a journal output but when as I mentioned last time when I did do a blog about this for international domestic workers day there is a lot of press interest so we're talking to BBC's Midlands about the descriptive stats and we think they'll plan to cover that in conjunction with the NGOs that we'd be working with providing they get some case studies that's what's important for them but I think there's ongoing interest in this and that once we've got something more solid from a hidden population side I think they'll cover that too so I don't the report is sort of a stage on the journey and I think the paper would be another like a second stage another way marker and so that's how I'm seeing it at present we've already submit our descriptive well one analysis from the descriptive statistics to a director of labor market enforcement consultation that closed a couple of weeks ago so that was sort of preempting some of the figures that Salim's created from the report so we're hoping that this sort of cumulative effect will sway policy because at the moment domestic workers aren't identified as a sector of particular concern by the labor market enforcement director and we're pressing to try and get them on the agenda so if you like that's the impact case good excellent no thank you it's very very helpful and I will leave all the impact and all the writing to you Caroline because that is not my comparative advantage and clearly it is it is yours but I think that's fantastic and I think you're right that the congratulations by the way that just sounds really exciting to be honest with you that just sounds really neat but if things is very helpful so if I'm so I think I'm getting more focused now the the essentially you've cleaved off the descriptive stuff which kudos like I think I mentioned in an email that the survey that you have is really rich so there's tons of opportunity for descriptive so by the way please send it over I'd love to just look at it and just see what's going on if you don't mind right but the point is for this paper we're taking a much more focus it's much more focus it's GN some it's hidden population and and that's that and and and then the impact stuff can can can can follow if I'm understanding you so that sounds great that's that's that's very useful it's very helpful to sort of have that in in in mind so then I mean I guess in terms of division of labor like we decided to get down to it so the if I remember correctly so there's there's six different estimators in the that paper is just the more I read it and reread it the sort of the second onion it just keeps getting like it's just there's all these layers that I didn't know and I thought I've read it really carefully by the way saline you get all the credit for this because you you wouldn't we had a dissertation meeting I'm rambling point is I love that paper it's weird the more I read it the weirder it gets so there's these six different estimators I think Carolina you focused on two of interest and I had suggested that maybe we could sort of augment them 23 and 24 or something like that doesn't matter um they have these bounds for these these three different adjustment factors and I think we decided although I'm certainly open to revisiting this that we could ask that we could calculate two of the adjustment factors and that the visibility the true positive rate was going to be difficult but maybe with this last email maybe we could just there might be some kind of hack if we could make this somewhat Herculean assumption that people people in age that know people in they've gone through the national referral mechanism those people know the person in age that makes sense it doesn't make sense the issue for what I remember the issue with the visibility is the the true positive rate is that you need to know and this is my opinion one of the weaknesses of G and some is it's really cognitively demanding so you need to sample from age and you'd ask people in the hidden population about what people in the sample frame know about them exactly exactly exactly you're speaking better than than than I am um there are these sort of hacks I mentioned that maybe we could I mean we should try it out and then just you know report it honestly or not report it if there's nothing interesting to report but but and Caroline you seem to be from what I remember in your email that you somewhat positive about this assumption that people have gone through the national referral mechanism know I don't know how to say this in English if if someone who's in the hidden population reports knowing eight people they've gone through the the national referral mechanism can we assume that all eight of those people know that the person responding the person in age is in the hidden population and if we can make that assumption then we can I think we can calculate this the third um the third um adjustment factor that's really interesting I mean I'm sorry sorry yeah I'm sorry no it's it's very very strange because it's all these I don't have a clear head for it okay so we can so we sample people and then some of them there were there's referrals and oh by by the way just really really quick and I'm sorry again to be so scattered the um so how does the recruitment work you give them coupons is there a fixed number of coupons or is it just as many people as they want to refer no it was um contact telephone contact numbers and I think they had up to five is that correct can you remember on the survey okay but they could refer up to five people okay um mobile phone number so that was effectively acting as a unique coupon identifier right good good thank you thank you that's I just right back okay so so we have the sample and and it's uh and it comes in waves thanks to referrals and that's all that's fine it's absolutely no problem some of okay let me start differently we have a sample from the sampling frame which is domestic workers in the UK so it's very well defined well they have a mobile number fine perfectly well defined excellent fantastic so that's that's that's the sampling frame some of those people happen to be in the hidden population that we just sort of lucked out to to to get and we can identify them through a number of Caroline you have a much better grasp on this than I but there's half a dozen different questions that we could use to to or combinations thereof to identify um oh yeah that's another thing I should before I forget risk um uh that we can identify okay fine so I'm I'm tabling that and leaving it to you all the experts um so we sort of we just all happen to have some people in in age in our sample now the the the probalters are what I originally thought there was only one but Caroline you've really pointed out that we actually have more than that so one is domestic workers so how many domestic workers working in the UK that have a mobile number do you know so that's fine we we we have officials I think correct me if I'm wrong we have official statistics on that so we know the the the that the known size subpopulation so that's fine we can use that for the scale up yeah that's a big question oh sorry to dampen the fire on that one but among the the visa situation is a little bit strange so a large number of domestic workers come over on the overseas domestic worker visa so where we have people from the Philippines so sort of a subsets of our sample we have a um a population estimate which we can base on the visa issuing numbers but then there's this other part of the sample so particularly for example people from Latin America who may come over on a BA visa where they have nationality Spanish or Portuguese nationality so therefore they have the right to come into the UK to work now that bit is more difficult to estimate so we could assume that we are only counting people with overseas domestic workers but we know if we do that we will be artificially limiting the overall population size so our estimation would be too large so I mean we can make that assumption but we'd have to state that as a limitation of that approach what makes sense yes yes and thank you and that's again the onion just keeps getting um could could be is it would it is it less egregious to I thought this is getting weird is it is it more palpable to assume that that people entering on a particular visa no domestic workers they're also on that visa so for example people from the Philippines yeah that would work that so that that might be one possible I mean you're right like this is just a limitation we'll just have to say it but I'm just thinking aloud if we could yeah try to okay right and another way to justify this would be your from what I understand and you guys know this way better than I do but the dealing with the NGOs are are it's what I gathered and Craig from wrong they're sort of national or ethnicity specific is what I gathered so that that might also help with the justification though okay so okay so so data problem 41 aside um we just so happened to have people in in age and so what's this this augmented relational data the game of contacts what what they would do is they would take the people in age and they would ask them how many doctors do you know pro valter and then how many doctors do you know that know that you're in the hidden population that's a hard question but that's what's required that's what's required for this third adjustment factor um so we don't have that that's fine so what I was suggesting is could we assume that so so we don't have doctors we don't have people named John we have domestic workers in the UK and we have people have gone through the national referral mechanism so by the just so I'm clear we do have numbers on that don't we we do okay good so so what I'm suggesting and again it's this is a big assumption and I don't know if it's justified but could we assume that so just for simplicity let's just say there's two pro valter groups there's the UK domestic workers who have a mobile number and people that you know they've gone through the national referral mechanism so if we we do we so happen to have somebody in in age and we ask them how many people do you know they've gone through the natural referral mechanism we have that answer we had that's I don't know what it is was question something could we assume so say so say I'm in age and you just so happen to sample me and I say I know eight people have gone through the natural referral mechanism could we assume that all eight of those people that I know that have gone through the natural referral mechanism can we assume that all eight of them know that I'm in the hidden population if so then I think we could we could work out all three of these I think more copies needed that we could work out all three of these adjustment factors now I'm sort of on the one hand that seems like a big assumption on the other hand it seems plausible but again you guys are the substance experts on this because if I know people that if I'm in if I'm being exploited I know people have gone through the natural referral mechanism it doesn't seem too big a leap to think that those people that were sort of can that we're we're we're into you know that I know them they know me yeah if I think it's arguable that we could assume it I mean I think we can state our assumptions yes of course yeah and and then be challenged on it that's right that's right at least it's uh we can say that that assumption may not hold true but that's the assumption that we've made for practical purposes in this study and like I said this is this is this is kind of icing on the cake I mean we don't you know we don't we don't it's not a deal breaker we don't have to do this I mean we can we've we've we've got the data we've got and we can do the calculations and do the bootstrap and and I was just thinking a lot if we could if we could well like I said you know we should probably just do a bunch of stuff and see what we want to report and uh okay so sorry I'm so scattered so um so um so what's next who who's going to do what and then I did have one additional sort of okay so so so what's next so what I think is we just need to start doing calculations so we need to uh do the insum do the adjustment factors uh personally I really like this idea of the bounds in the subliminal appendix so basically so my idea is to is to um so say we can't estimate all three of the adjustment factors we can use a kind of sensitivity analysis and say so we we know that the true positive rate ranges between zero and one or zero infinity I don't remember where it is but it's it's in the paper what happens to our estimates of the size of the hidden population as we just sweep over all of the possible values for this this third adjustment factor um I kind of like that because it it sort of tells you something about I mean it's that it's heuristic but it tells you something about about well it tells you something about how important these adjustment factors are in in estimating the size of the hidden population right if if if you sweep over all the possible values and the size of the hidden population I mean it's going to change some who doesn't change by an order of magnitude and that gives you well that tells you something that that third adjustment factor the true positive rate isn't very important in this particular instance which is which is something I mean that that's that's information that's that's that's that's good you know okay so I think we need to just start doing calculations start doing this these what I'm calling sensitivity analysis but probably is a better word salim I'm going to put you to work on this adjacency matrix to to to do the the bootstrap and I'm sorry if I'm sounding bossy or whatnot I'm just I'm just trying to just just okay okay okay and regarding the method you are but and we it might take some time maybe good thank you see I'm I'm confident you're very capable and I know this from from years of working with you so um that's great sorry my legs fell asleep um there was one new thing that uh came up in one of Caroline's emails that I wanted to not not that I want to give us work to do or me more work to do or us more work to do but um sorry my fit fall asleep um Caroline you mentioned something about like okay so we mentioned earlier that there's these we have these different questions that are uh could be used to identify people in age and then I think Caroline from among you had suggested could be sort of create an index or an aggregate variable that indicated what I was hearing and I don't know if you said this something about risk um and I really like that I don't I'm just raising it to see if this is something we want to explore or put in the paper the the reason okay so look so we have these different indicators that we could definitely use to indicate if someone is in the hidden population that's great we can try out different ones and we can put a table and show the comparison and that that's very cool in and of itself because to my knowledge not a lot of studies do that so that's another advantage of the of your survey uh Caroline but I think and correct me if I'm wrong that you had suggested like um could we combine them or sort of some sort of like a likeert scale is kind of what I had in mind I really I I just want to raise it to see if that's something we want to explore but the reason I think it's needed is because it's as far as I can tell me again you all are the experts but when I read about modern slavery there's always this not always but there's almost always this modern slavery and risk of of uh of experiencing modern slavery and and what I'm getting at it seems like a lot of the literature that I read again you all are the experts on this there is this dichotomous component of experiencing modern slavery yes or no but then there's it seems on from like the policy pages white papers or whatnot that there's this risk aspect what's the risk of someone being exposed or experiencing modern slavery and and my ears sort of perked up when I read your email Caroline about combining various questions to get this index or ranking or I don't I don't remember the language that you used um so I just wanted to raise that to see if that's something we want to explore uh question mark I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry say one to seven or one to five against a particular attribute and those attributes are you saying could be the various questions that we have um designed into the survey exactly yes yes yes and maybe you're right maybe the liquid scale is too is too strong maybe we we need something like a factor analysis or something so the way I and it's been since graduate school since I studied this so I could be wrong but the way I remember liquid scales is that there's it's a hierarchy right so if if you answered yes to question two then for sure you answered yes to question one so basically they're these like levels of experiences and from what I remember the questions kind of some of the questions seem to have that kind of flavor and correct me if I'm wrong I could be I could be wrong there but but I mean if it's liquid or if it's if it's not the the the liquid would be great but it's very very strong because it has this hierarchy this nesting feature attribute but if not then you know some other way of aggregating individual questions into a the idea is to get away from the dichotomous are you and are you speaking about slavery yes or no into some sort of gradient where we and then could we sell that the index or the ranking variable the thing that we make as something akin to risk of experiencing modern slavery yes yes 100% take take question if you answered yes to question one and yes to question two that would put you at a higher risk of modern slavery and sort of add on to end whatever exactly exactly right exactly right exactly right sorry you said it way better than I did and much more succinctly as well I'm so sorry oh boy waking up earlier next time drinking lots more coffee but but and like I said I don't know if this this is something we want to do I mean it's just again it's where it's it's icing on the cake it's not we definitely don't need to it's just the idea of risk popped into my head after reading one of your emails caroline and it rang this bell of a yeah the risk is really interesting and I think it comes from this criminalization of modern slavery so if you if you're saying that you are in modern slavery it implies that you've met the legal standard for your whatever conditions you're experiencing being proven and somebody being prosecuted so that's obviously quite a high bar and there's obviously a spectrum of labor what might be called labor exploitation rather than modern slavery which are undesirable conditions but they may not be modern they may not qualify you as being somebody with positive grounds for a modern slavery case right but the more of these poor um indicators of conditions that exist the more likely it is that your case would be considered that of modern slavery so that seems to tie in with what you're suggesting Scott perfect that's again I couldn't literally I couldn't say say it better myself Caroline yet that's exactly right and also just to double kill on that we don't we have that from what I remember reading through the code book we definitely have that there's these you know half a dozen a dozen different questions that sort of get at these different I don't know angles aspects would have you so like I mean I think that's yes Caroline yes 100% uh one thank you that's you've said it better than I did two I'm pretty sure I don't know if we're in a unique position but we definitely thanks to your survey I believe we have data to do just that and then three can't count is that something we want to do in this paper yeah we can it would it would seem a neat way of addressing these multiple instances of exploitation to to say that the more of these questions that you're demonstrating apply to your situation the more likely it is that you are at risk and the case we have to say at risk yes modern slavery yes because it's we haven't got legally improving cases but I think we can legitimately say that excellent okay so now there's more that's very very cool thank you uh now I just realized do I know how to do that I don't know I mean the neat thing there is like this might be oh boy I need a lot more coffee so now that I've just pitched this thing about risk and not a continuous rather than a dichotomous variable now I'm just now thinking hang on how do you do scale up with yeah what's it was a continuous dv I have I have no idea um yeah we should think about I mean it's a neat it's a neat question I like I like these patches okay all right well thank you for that and again sorry for just meandering all over the place but Caroline you've you've you've you've you've saved my nonsensical rhetoric um so um yeah so we've got Selene for September uh I'm gonna have to spend I don't know how much time we're gonna have for this I'm very very interested and I understand times of the essence and if I'm being honest I think you're both right that like or I don't know if you're saying this but the sort of September is my best it's going to be September or December because when teaching starts for me at least it just just the teaching starts it just it's it's really really heavy um so what should we do next so I guess we press ahead with um if you are happy to direct Selene for these last two weeks and see how far we can get um and then we take stop and I can start drafting an article for modern slavery based on what we've got and then if we need to we come back to it in December I guess sorry we don't get it no I mean that's the the um reality of research and teaching I understand so for me I'm not teaching this semester I'm teaching spring semester so I will have time to do some drafting um so I suppose the question is how far can we get by then that's the concept of it isn't it okay for Dr. Moser I will send you that excellent spreadsheet that I shared earlier and what else is needed for that data clinic or anything else you should tell us to leave in the email if you want yeah well so one thing and this is going to be a judgment so I'll leave it to to the two of you is is picking the questions I think you're 100% right Carolina I was making it too let's just pick five six questions that we think are indicators of uh you had the right you had a better phrase but what questions we want to add together to come up with this index or rank rank variable there's several that we could we'll need to make a decision so I'll leave that to you we've got you know there's for my memory it's and again kudos to you for the survey design it's it's everything from before I remember there's even like an explicit question like are you being exploited maybe it's not literally that exploited that explicit but then there's all these other you know have you been detained does your employer have your travel documents there's all these other questions so we'll need to pick some collection of those to to add together to make this this this risk indicator I don't know which questions those are I'll leave that to to to to you um Selim uh yes you and I will be in touch regarding the data um are you comfortable Selim doing the calculation so Caroline had this really good uh it was it was from several emails ago but uh uh sort of a step by step the protocol yeah the protocol what to calculate um once you tell me the data cleaning is good to go then I can stop doing it and I will face some challenge that's fine and I'll get back that's fine good good so in the in the short run then um we need to pick questions that indicate that you're in the hidden population questions plural and then we can try out these individual questions then we can also add them all together to get this risk index which I think is very cool and also very challenging um step two uh Selim you and I will have to work on this adjacency matrix that's only important for the bootstrapping which comes later so in the in the in the short run we can you Selim can start doing these calculations based on on Caroline's protocol uh and Selim you and I can can email on that and yeah let's push hard in September uh and uh and see see what we we can do I I believe for sure we can do the calculations we can do the calculations today I think um well once we have the questions sorted out uh the bootstrapping will take a little bit of work but it's relatively straightforward the risk and scale up is really interesting and in my mind sort of the step three down down the road I don't I don't really know I don't have a clear picture on how to how to do that just yet um but I I think I have a more focused uh idea of what's of what's happening I wish we had more time I'm really sorry everybody that uh yeah sorry no that's great we appreciate everybody's juggling various things and we got started the semester coming up there's a lot to think about so let me read this back to you so that I can check I've got this right so from I need to pick the five or six question combinations to produce a rank variable that would indicate somebody was at risk of being in the hidden population um Selim will start calculating uh the GSM formula that were identified in the protocol from our existing data set and you and Selim will you will help Selim send the data in preparation for bootstrapping and then I think you had another point which uh the the risk uh uh sort of that's on me or all of us to think about how to do scale up when the dependent variable isn't dichotomous so scale up is meant to estimate the size of a population but if we want to estimate the amount of risk in a population I don't it's not I don't I don't know how to do that um but but I we we can think about it and we can figure out a way to do it does that make sense I don't know if that makes sense yeah I think you just say yeah we don't know how to do this yet but we think it could be interesting yeah that's right so um yeah yeah I think for me that would be going back to the and then Selgin again trying to work out what their equations say about yeah they use yeah whether you're in this situation of labor exploitation exploitation or not versus yeah okay rather uh more of a spectrum exactly exactly you nailed it I mean the the there's sort of cheap ways to do it like so there's all these model based so if you guys the Laga paper I don't I can't remember who I've talked to about which papers anyway so the the the Feehan and Solnik again amazing but they sort of have these two approaches design based and model based and they seem to my my reading is they kind of favor the design based which is fine so that's like designing the sample and whatnot there's this whole other way of doing this kind of estimation that's model based where you just write down formulas and then you get a fast computer to do MCMC bays posteriors blah blah blah and so it's sort of the cheap way to do this is you just in the model based world you just replace a binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution and and you're off and running um this is all regards to this this risk business um uh forget I said any of that let me let me think on it I don't know I don't know how to do it I'm sure there's some way to do it but let me forget I said anything let me let me let me think on it and come back to you if you find it if you find any papers that will be useful for us to read as background Scott then do just log them across and I'll um if you if you find a come across anything and I'll also do this yes please I think the answer we'll see if we can find the answer perhaps in the literature or the gap in the literature but I suspect that's for me going beyond my methodological capability is certainly a present this is why collaborating is great this we all have we all have comparative advantages and I horrible at writing I don't know this the substance of this whatsoever so it's great to yeah this is this is why collaborating is great um okay so hopefully we've got a complementary set of skills and I mean if we find I know at the beginning you said you're not statistician but you obviously have a great deal more statistical knowledge than I do but if you do feel that we need somebody else then I mean let me know and we can try and recruit somebody because there was another guy who made contact with me I said he was interested in this I think it's um David Murphy do you know David no so I just said it was something we were working on at the moment but I can have a look to see if we need to expand the team then we can do that too I think okay let's let's let's like you said present yeah I think I mean you've just been your advice has been invaluable so I think we we press on I agreed I agreed let's see I think you're on the same page let's let's let's do a hard push in September and see how far we get and um Selene you and I will be emailing a lot in the next two weeks um right that's perfect okay I think go ahead I've maybe making some notes just to capture what we've said um I'll tidy those up and then I'll email them around everybody say that we've got another marker in the sand about just just trying to capture the discussions really sounds great yeah thanks so much and uh it's very it's very cool I'm especially this next stage I'm actually very very excited about because this is like this is where we start learning stuff this is where we like actually get anyway I'm I'm very excited so let's let's uh thank you again thank you again right that's cool right fantastic thank thank you all uh we'll be in touch thanks very much take care
