Certainly. Here's a summary of the provided text:

---

**Topic:** *Discussion of Research and Collaboration*

---

**Background:**
- The group discusses a research project they are collectively working on, related to modern slavery and hidden populations.

---

**Survey and Data:**
1. They have conducted a survey, and Caroline is acknowledged for the survey design.
2. They possess a dataset with potential indicators of modern slavery.
3. The group discusses the importance of data cleaning and ensuring quality in the dataset before analysis.

---

**Methodological Discussions:**
1. **Scale-up and Dichotomy:** The group considers the challenge of estimating the size of the population at risk of modern slavery. They think about how to scale up when the dependent variable isn't dichotomous, moving from a binary perspective (at risk/not at risk) to more of a spectrum.
2. **Risk Index:** They contemplate creating an index or rank variable to determine the risk. The idea is to use a set of questions that, when combined, could indicate someone's likelihood of being in the hidden population.
3. **Bootstrapping and Adjacency Matrix:** Discussed as part of the methodology, with specific roles assigned.

---

**Collaboration and Roles:**
1. Caroline is credited for the survey design and offers guidance on picking relevant questions from the survey for the risk index.
2. Selene is assigned the role of working on data calculations and will closely collaborate with Scott on this. Scott will guide Selene in preparing the data for bootstrapping.
3. Scott provides methodological insights, especially on the statistical aspects. He also suggests that there might be a need to consult the literature to understand specific challenges.

---

**Next Steps and Timeline:**
1. The group aims for a productive September to advance their research before teaching commitments begin.
2. They discuss selecting 5-6 key questions from the survey to formulate a risk indicator.
3. Scott and Selene will work together on data-related aspects, including preparing for bootstrapping.
4. The group acknowledges the challenges and uncertainties but expresses enthusiasm for the upcoming phase of their research.

**Additional Notes:**
- The possibility of expanding the team is brought up, with David Murphy mentioned as a potential collaborator.
- The group values collaboration and sees the different skill sets of members as strengths.
- The group will be communicating via emails for further discussions, updates, and decision-making.

---

**Closing:**
- The meeting ends on a positive note, with team members expressing gratitude and looking forward to the next steps.
