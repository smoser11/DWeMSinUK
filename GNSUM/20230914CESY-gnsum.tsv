0	7320	there you go there you go sorry for being late thanks for tech problems you
7320	13080	know how it is but I got all of your documents I've read them in skimmed is
13080	18840	probably a more accurate word but I've got my coffee I've got my pen I'm
18840	26200	eager to get into it so thank you you're absolutely right with those things
26960	35160	that is what we need to work out sorry I'm not arriving with a map saying this
35160	40200	is how we we have to proceed I think it's something that we will find our way
40200	49160	through the jungle between us I hope so I mean already you're pointing us in the
49160	56160	direction of bootstrapping has been invaluable so yeah we really just sort of
56160	61400	feeling a way through the next steps to understand who's actually say what to do
61400	68720	and who's doing what right yeah that's all
68720	76120	I mean it might be an ongoing conversation it might be something we can't bottom now but it probably is a good idea also to discuss sort of time
76120	81880	frames that or at least share what we have in our own minds about time frame
81880	86200	so that we can see whether whether everything matches together or whether
86200	95800	there are going to be problems yeah so yeah so in terms of what's next you
95800	100480	talked about the objective and the division of labour well the objective
100480	106440	remains really to generate this estimate of the hidden population among
106440	112160	domestic workers as far as we are able to and you you can generalize network
112160	119440	scale-up methods to do that I mean that's the the overriding objective and
119440	123280	then how we do that I mean I think that's a matter of debate we I think as I
123280	127160	mentioned in my email have you seen it we've got Selim with us definitely full
127200	131280	time until the end of the month so again this comes into the time frame
131280	139880	conversation can we make maximum use of Selim's time now and then there's the
139880	145020	possibility I mean Selim come in here now if you want to but I believe
145020	153180	Selim's keen to continue looking at this yeah so you don't need to share my screen
153180	157460	yeah what you don't want to be able to share this so Dr. Moseley you sent this
157460	165420	article about the yoke yoke at all pay but who's on 22 for the neighborhood so
165420	171220	I've tried to understand it and and also work on it and what I understand is that
171260	179300	we need certain points or aspects to perform that bootstrap for our data set
179300	187540	and that is like the notes this is the list of our IDs basically and then we
187540	192500	have the edges and then we have the trades and degree so all that stuff I
192500	197980	have tried to put this down to the Excel spreadsheet I'm going to share it now so
197980	207180	you can tell me to what extent it looks cleaned up can you see it yes I can see
207180	210840	it thank you very much okay yeah so you're 100% right Selim so the I was
210840	218420	thinking about this this morning the the so I did have a quick look at the
218420	225180	okay let me take half a step back so by the way Caroline not that you need to
225180	229740	hear it for me but kudos your your lit review the document that you sent was
229740	236100	really really really spot-on but the so taking a whole step back the the
236100	241780	neighborhood boot is it's building on this thing called a tree okay so what's
241780	244620	the issue the issue is we want to bootstrapping but we definitely don't
244620	247620	have independence here Caroline's you rightly mentioned you know at best we
247620	252620	have a convenience sample in our DS so the issue is how do you bootstrapping in
252620	257660	these in this setting where you don't have independence whatsoever and so these
257660	261980	clever people have different ideas and there's this very very sophisticated and
261980	266660	I confess I didn't fully comprehend it but there's this tree method which is
266660	271540	meant to anyway doesn't matter then these other people as you both rightly said
271540	275300	come along and say actually there's an easier and better way to do this called
275300	279100	this neighborhood boot and and you're 100% right Selim that what's crucial here
279100	284420	is we need we need we need IDs we need to be able to uniquely identify each
284420	289660	respondent and then we need to know who referred who and so usually that that
289660	293740	takes the form of what's called an adjacency matrix this is just a graph so
293740	299100	you've got the nodes are the are the IDs and so if I'm person 60 and you're a
299100	305740	person 41 and I refer you then there's an edge from person 60 to person 41 you
305740	308900	get the idea and so on and so forth so that's the sort of the structure of the
308900	316700	data well that's one of the that's one component of the data that will need to
316700	319780	do this this neighborhood bootstrap that the idea behind the input was really
319780	324460	kind of surprising to me that it works so well but it does and we can sit sit
324460	327940	site and that's great but the idea is you just take everybody who refers
327940	333980	anybody and you just you just sample with replacement them and turns out that
333980	338980	works really well it's it's sort of surprisingly simple and and but at least
338980	345540	according to the papers it seems to work really really well so so so that's the
345540	349060	structure that we need so right so now I'm rambling coffee's just now kicking
349060	354620	in sorry so so Selim we need unique IDs for every single every single person and
354620	360700	then we need to know who referred who so thank you for sharing your screen so
360700	367660	like on line three it's a recruiter so you got node one recruiter and then node
367660	373820	two respondent recruit I don't understand can you flush that out for me I can I
373820	379700	can walk you through thank you so what we see here are the IDs of the people so
379700	386500	for some two is the ID person three four five these are the ID of the people and
386500	391780	when when there's written note one that's the recruiter that is 60 so when
391780	399460	we scroll down to 60 here we are seeing that is Anna here that would be Anna so
399460	409140	Anna has preferred on recruiting the second one so 60 ID 60 has recruited or
409140	415860	referred person ID to and when there's no number written this means they haven't
416140	424020	recruited they just complete the survey based on the promotion that our NGO
424020	430020	partners has forwarded to their to their own people so these are the seeds so this
430020	437220	right okay and then we can continue with that for some 41 has recruited 10 and
437380	445860	and six these are these other people good good yeah good good good so then that's
445860	451380	excellent thank you so then the next step would be to turn that into an adjacency
451380	459180	matrix I'm trying to think of the can you if you maybe already have sorry if you
459180	462780	have something but could you email me that excel file and I can have a think on
462780	474500	the easiest way to reshape this into an adjacency matrix yeah yeah I read and
474500	479820	I think there's something like zero and one yeah exactly so where where do we have
479820	487740	like where do these connections exist exactly yeah so I will send you the
487740	492860	excellent spreadsheet and you will tell me what to do next yeah after a lot more
492860	498660	coffee yeah so but just to be clear so this is this is only relevant for the
498660	504100	for the bootstrapping which I think we're all on board with is this is the
504100	511260	way to go with with these uncertainty estimates the I mean I guess you know we
511260	516380	could start with the calculations already right I mean Caroline you're you're I
516380	521860	know we call it memo or outline of sort of what how to proceed with the
521860	526700	calculations we could we could start with that given the data that we have I
526700	534140	think so that protocol that I sent through that had the different sum
534140	540140	quantities and actually the sort of the translation of the formula into our from
540900	550340	results into fiend and salgonics equations yes yes yes yes yes yes exactly
550340	558340	sorry sorry again fresh cup of coffee yeah I mean that would be our sample our
558340	562420	original sample data but without the bootstrapping exactly so we would be
562420	567100	doing a first pass through with our raw data I don't know I'm using the right
567100	574120	terminology as the first the first approach to actually plugging some
574120	579020	data in and getting some output yeah that's right so this would just be point
579020	583100	estimates without without any kind of uncertainty the end you're right the
583100	590340	bootstrapping would be a post hoc or ex post it would come later I think it's
590340	595860	gonna I think it's neat I think it's a nice contribution it's as slim as
595860	602620	intimated it's gonna take a bit more work to to structure the data in a way
602620	606420	that is amenable to doing this neighborhood bootstrap but we can we can
606420	611900	we can do that I mean I should have prepared more for this I'm sorry about
611900	620540	that I mean drink my coffee oh really it's it's definitely we're feeling our
620540	626020	way here so this is definitely a joint process the feelings mutual feelings
626020	631980	mutual and please stop you're gonna blush like a like a pink pig if you
631980	636300	anyway thank you very much with the feelings mutual I'm very much I guess
636300	641780	and again I'm so sorry for my completely scattered emails and behavior this
641780	647420	morning a few questions come to mind so I take your point Caroline thank you
647420	652140	very much for the the clarity on you know I think we all see what the
652140	656020	objective is and the tasks that are required we need to do these calculations
656020	660860	we need to get these uncertainty estimates a few questions that popped my
660860	667140	mind are things like audience or and I think Salimi mentioned a journal journal
667140	675180	so like so what what do we want this paper to look like is this a methods
675180	679060	paper is this a substance paper is it a little from column A a little from column
679060	688100	B is it you know what what um what what do we want the yeah who do we want the
688100	694220	paper to be for I guess is probably better yeah so I'm I'm wondering whether
694220	700980	it could go into a modern slavery journal if it isn't a methods paper which
700980	705140	I suspect it isn't I think we're not really going to make a contribution to
705140	710620	methods we're going to be using methods in an interesting way we hope to
710620	718780	produce an output but actually the the interest is in the the application of
718780	724940	this method to a particular social situation and which is looking at labor
724940	731180	exploitation among domestic workers in the UK and somewhere like the Journal of
731180	736900	Modern Slavery might be interested in the application of this method because
736900	743500	there have been recommendations from GFMS which is the Global Fund for Ending
743500	748380	Modern Slavery that these sorts of techniques ought to be used but as yet
748380	753980	there isn't any as far as I'm aware anyone who's tried to do it yeah so that
753980	758660	would probably protect us a little bit from the purists who would say well
758700	763900	you're really not using your method as appropriate as pristinely as perhaps you
763900	771300	could have done but it would perhaps meet the needs of a community for an
771300	776260	example of how this method was used but also providing some as you say a little
776260	779860	bit of common and a little bit but providing some substance that would be
779860	785540	of interest so potentially I mean I don't know whether you're interested in
785540	790940	publishing in that sort of journal it's not high-ranking but it is this is sort
790940	796900	of it's bread and butter how does that sound oh yeah yeah yeah I'm interested
796900	800420	in publishing anywhere I mean not literally anywhere but I mean I'm I'm
800420	805260	very very open to I'm not at all purists or snob or anything but yeah
805260	813780	that's absolutely fine for me so then I guess the what's next is sort of you
813780	817500	know tasks and I think I think you're you're right Caroline that we're yeah
817500	820540	we're not gonna make a methodological contribution I think the contribution is
820540	826180	applying these techniques to this and you're right I've been I've only seen G
826180	832980	and some used in very limited applications and I agree with you I've
832980	836580	never seen it for for modern slavery and certainly not modern slavery in the UK so
836580	842660	I think that's absolutely a contribution so I guess what's next is as you said
842660	848580	times of the essence so yeah who does who does what when
850980	858020	well I'm very happy to lead on the writing if that's oh yeah yeah I mean
858020	864020	that's what I'm trying to collect in terms of keeping memos of our meeting
864020	871180	so that I can generate a methodological section I know Salim and I are just
871300	875180	about to publish a report on the descriptive statistics related to this
875180	883300	work good so Salim's done quite a lot of work we had our survey checked through
883300	887540	by the director of labor market enforcement directors team and they
887540	891660	were particularly interested from a descriptive point of view in differences
891660	896860	between employment statuses in domestic workers so we have a report coming out
896860	900980	we're just talking about the date but we think it'll be the 9th of October that
900980	905060	focuses very much on different employment statuses which draws on
905060	910500	description descriptive statistics from that so that sort of side has been done
910500	917180	good but it I see this work as sort of feeding directly into a journal output
917180	923100	but when as I mentioned last time when I did do a blog about this for
923100	928100	international domestic workers day there is a lot of press interest so we're
928100	936500	talking to BBC's Midlands about the descriptive stats and we think they'll
936500	941900	plan to cover that in conjunction with the NGOs that we'd be working with
941900	948140	providing they get some case studies that's what's important for them but I
948140	952900	think there's ongoing interest in this and that once we've got something more
952900	959420	solid from a hidden population side I think they'll cover that too so I don't
959420	965460	the report is sort of a stage on the journey and I think the paper would be
965460	972500	another like a second stage another way marker and so that's how I'm seeing it
972500	977900	at present we've already submit our descriptive well one analysis from the
977900	982540	descriptive statistics to a director of labor market enforcement consultation
982540	988260	that closed a couple of weeks ago so that was sort of preempting some of the
988260	996580	figures that Salim's created from the report so we're hoping that this sort
996580	1003540	of cumulative effect will sway policy because at the moment domestic workers
1003540	1008180	aren't identified as a sector of particular concern by the labor market
1008180	1013860	enforcement director and we're pressing to try and get them on the agenda so if
1013860	1019220	you like that's the impact case good excellent no thank you it's very very
1019220	1022700	helpful and I will leave all the impact and all the writing to you Caroline
1022700	1026180	because that is not my comparative advantage and clearly it is it is yours
1026180	1029540	but I think that's fantastic and I think you're right that the congratulations
1029540	1031780	by the way that just sounds really exciting to be honest with you that just
1031780	1036100	sounds really neat but if things is very helpful so if I'm
1037020	1043780	so I think I'm getting more focused now the the essentially you've cleaved off
1043780	1048060	the descriptive stuff which kudos like I think I mentioned in an email that the
1048060	1051740	survey that you have is really rich so there's tons of opportunity for
1051740	1056300	descriptive so by the way please send it over I'd love to just look at it and
1056300	1062540	just see what's going on if you don't mind right but the point is for this
1062540	1066860	paper we're taking a much more focus it's much more focus it's GN some it's
1066860	1071180	hidden population and and that's that and and and then the impact stuff can
1071180	1074780	can can can follow if I'm understanding you so that sounds great that's that's
1074780	1079820	that's very useful it's very helpful to sort of have that in in in mind so then
1079820	1084980	I mean I guess in terms of division of labor like we decided to get down to it
1084980	1092900	so the if I remember correctly so there's there's six different estimators in
1092900	1097380	the that paper is just the more I read it and reread it the sort of the second
1097380	1101380	onion it just keeps getting like it's just there's all these layers that I
1101380	1104020	didn't know and I thought I've read it really carefully by the way saline you
1104020	1107900	get all the credit for this because you you wouldn't we had a dissertation
1107900	1112540	meeting I'm rambling point is I love that paper it's weird the more I read it
1112540	1116900	the weirder it gets so there's these six different estimators I think Carolina
1116900	1122580	you focused on two of interest and I had suggested that maybe we could sort of
1122580	1128620	augment them 23 and 24 or something like that doesn't matter um they have these
1128620	1134620	bounds for these these three different adjustment factors and I think we
1134620	1139060	decided although I'm certainly open to revisiting this that we could ask that
1139140	1143140	we could calculate two of the adjustment factors and that the visibility
1147780	1154820	the true positive rate was going to be difficult but maybe with this last email
1156500	1162020	maybe we could just there might be some kind of hack if we could make this somewhat
1162100	1170820	Herculean assumption that people people in age that know people in they've gone
1170820	1177260	through the national referral mechanism those people know the person in age that
1177260	1185020	makes sense it doesn't make sense the issue for what I remember the issue with
1185020	1190620	the visibility is the the true positive rate is that you need to know and this is
1190860	1195100	my opinion one of the weaknesses of G and some is it's really cognitively demanding so you need
1195100	1201980	to sample from age and you'd ask people in the hidden population about what people in the sample
1201980	1211420	frame know about them exactly exactly exactly you're speaking better than than than I am um
1212700	1217340	there are these sort of hacks I mentioned that maybe we could I mean we should try it out and
1217420	1222540	then just you know report it honestly or not report it if there's nothing interesting to
1223580	1229180	report but but and Caroline you seem to be from what I remember in your email that you somewhat
1229180	1233900	positive about this assumption that people have gone through the national referral mechanism
1235260	1241900	know I don't know how to say this in English if if someone who's in the hidden population
1242380	1247100	reports knowing eight people they've gone through the the national referral mechanism
1247820	1255340	can we assume that all eight of those people know that the person responding the person in age
1255980	1262700	is in the hidden population and if we can make that assumption then we can I think we can calculate
1262780	1281900	this the third um the third um adjustment factor that's really interesting I mean I'm sorry sorry
1282780	1289420	yeah I'm sorry no it's it's very very strange because it's all these I don't have a clear
1289420	1295740	head for it okay so we can so we sample people and then some of them there were there's referrals
1295740	1300300	and oh by by the way just really really quick and I'm sorry again to be so scattered the um
1301500	1305500	so how does the recruitment work you give them coupons is there a fixed number of coupons
1305500	1313020	or is it just as many people as they want to refer no it was um contact telephone contact numbers
1313980	1319260	and I think they had up to five is that correct can you remember on the survey okay but they
1319260	1326860	could refer up to five people okay um mobile phone number so that was effectively acting as a unique
1326860	1332300	coupon identifier right good good thank you thank you that's I just right back okay so so we have
1332300	1340700	the sample and and it's uh and it comes in waves thanks to referrals and that's all that's fine it's
1340700	1346140	absolutely no problem some of okay let me start differently we have a sample from the sampling
1346140	1350620	frame which is domestic workers in the UK so it's very well defined well they have a mobile number
1351180	1356300	fine perfectly well defined excellent fantastic so that's that's that's the sampling frame some of
1356300	1362220	those people happen to be in the hidden population that we just sort of lucked out to to to get and
1362220	1368540	we can identify them through a number of Caroline you have a much better grasp on this than I but
1368540	1374700	there's half a dozen different questions that we could use to to or combinations thereof to
1374700	1383100	identify um oh yeah that's another thing I should before I forget risk um uh that we can identify
1383100	1388940	okay fine so I'm I'm tabling that and leaving it to you all the experts um so we sort of we just
1389020	1399660	all happen to have some people in in age in our sample now the the the probalters are
1400780	1404300	what I originally thought there was only one but Caroline you've really pointed out that we
1404300	1410860	actually have more than that so one is domestic workers so how many domestic workers working in
1410860	1417020	the UK that have a mobile number do you know so that's fine we we we have officials I think
1417020	1420540	correct me if I'm wrong we have official statistics on that so we know the the the
1421260	1426620	that the known size subpopulation so that's fine we can use that for the scale up
1427260	1436380	yeah that's a big question oh sorry to dampen the fire on that one but among the the visa
1436380	1442460	situation is a little bit strange so a large number of domestic workers come over on the overseas
1442460	1449260	domestic worker visa so where we have people from the Philippines so sort of a subsets of our
1449260	1457580	sample we have a um a population estimate which we can base on the visa issuing numbers but then
1457580	1464860	there's this other part of the sample so particularly for example people from Latin America who may
1464860	1474780	come over on a BA visa where they have nationality Spanish or Portuguese nationality so therefore
1474780	1481820	they have the right to come into the UK to work now that bit is more difficult to estimate
1483100	1488940	so we could assume that we are only counting people with overseas domestic workers but we
1488940	1495820	know if we do that we will be artificially limiting the overall population size so our
1495820	1501740	estimation would be too large so I mean we can make that assumption but we'd have to state that
1502620	1510220	as a limitation of that approach what makes sense yes yes and thank you and that's again the onion
1510220	1517260	just keeps getting um could could be is it would it is it less egregious to
1520140	1521820	I thought this is getting weird
1525660	1530860	is it is it more palpable to assume that
1531820	1541260	that people entering on a particular visa no domestic workers they're also on that visa so
1541260	1547740	for example people from the Philippines yeah that would work that so that that might be one
1547740	1551580	possible I mean you're right like this is just a limitation we'll just have to say it but I'm
1551580	1566780	just thinking aloud if we could yeah try to okay right and another way to justify this would be
1566780	1570940	your from what I understand and you guys know this way better than I do but the dealing with the NGOs
1570940	1577740	are are it's what I gathered and Craig from wrong they're sort of national or ethnicity specific
1577820	1582540	is what I gathered so that that might also help with the justification though okay so okay so so
1584460	1591740	data problem 41 aside um we just so happened to have people in in age and so what's this this
1591740	1598940	augmented relational data the game of contacts what what they would do is they would take the
1598940	1605900	people in age and they would ask them how many doctors do you know pro valter and then how many
1605900	1613500	doctors do you know that know that you're in the hidden population that's a hard question but that's
1613500	1617900	what's required that's what's required for this third adjustment factor um so we don't have that
1617900	1625180	that's fine so what I was suggesting is could we assume that so so we don't have doctors we don't
1625180	1631980	have people named John we have domestic workers in the UK and we have people have gone through the
1632060	1636060	national referral mechanism so by the just so I'm clear we do have numbers on that don't we
1637020	1642700	we do okay good so so what I'm suggesting and again it's this is a big assumption and I don't
1642700	1649020	know if it's justified but could we assume that so just for simplicity let's just say there's two
1649020	1654380	pro valter groups there's the UK domestic workers who have a mobile number and people that you know
1654380	1659660	they've gone through the national referral mechanism so if we we do we so happen to have
1660460	1663900	somebody in in age and we ask them how many people do you know they've gone through the
1663900	1667900	natural referral mechanism we have that answer we had that's I don't know what it is was question
1667900	1673660	something could we assume so say so say I'm in age and you just so happen to sample me and I say I
1673660	1677900	know eight people have gone through the natural referral mechanism could we assume that all eight
1677900	1682860	of those people that I know that have gone through the natural referral mechanism can we assume that
1682860	1691420	all eight of them know that I'm in the hidden population if so then I think we could we could
1691420	1696700	work out all three of these I think more copies needed that we could work out all three of these
1696700	1702540	adjustment factors now I'm sort of on the one hand that seems like a big assumption on the other hand
1703980	1709900	it seems plausible but again you guys are the substance experts on this because if I know people
1709900	1713660	that if I'm in if I'm being exploited I know people have gone through the natural referral
1713660	1721980	mechanism it doesn't seem too big a leap to think that those people that were sort of can
1721980	1724780	that we're we're we're into you know that I know them they know me
1726460	1731660	yeah if I think it's arguable that we could assume it I mean I think we can state our assumptions
1732060	1733580	yes of course yeah
1733580	1739900	and and then be challenged on it that's right that's right at least it's uh we can say that
1739900	1744460	that assumption may not hold true but that's the assumption that we've made for practical purposes
1744460	1748700	in this study and like I said this is this is this is kind of icing on the cake I mean we don't
1749660	1756860	you know we don't we don't it's not a deal breaker we don't have to do this I mean we can we've we've
1756860	1760780	we've got the data we've got and we can do the calculations and do the bootstrap and
1760780	1765740	and I was just thinking a lot if we could if we could well like I said you know we should
1765740	1772860	probably just do a bunch of stuff and see what we want to report and uh okay so sorry I'm so
1772860	1781260	scattered so um so um so what's next who who's going to do what and then I did have one additional
1781260	1786700	sort of okay so so so what's next so what I think is we just need to start doing calculations so we
1786700	1793900	need to uh do the insum do the adjustment factors uh personally I really like this idea of
1795020	1803980	the bounds in the subliminal appendix so basically so my idea is to is to um so say we can't estimate
1803980	1808700	all three of the adjustment factors we can use a kind of sensitivity analysis and say so we we
1808700	1814300	know that the true positive rate ranges between zero and one or zero infinity I don't remember
1814300	1818620	where it is but it's it's in the paper what happens to our estimates of the size of the
1818620	1826220	hidden population as we just sweep over all of the possible values for this this third adjustment
1826220	1833660	factor um I kind of like that because it it sort of tells you something about I mean it's that it's
1833660	1839660	heuristic but it tells you something about about well it tells you something about how important
1839660	1844940	these adjustment factors are in in estimating the size of the hidden population right if if
1844940	1849900	if you sweep over all the possible values and the size of the hidden population I mean it's
1849900	1854700	going to change some who doesn't change by an order of magnitude and that gives you well that tells
1854700	1858540	you something that that third adjustment factor the true positive rate isn't very important in
1858540	1862860	this particular instance which is which is something I mean that that's that's information
1862860	1868060	that's that's that's that's good you know okay so I think we need to just start doing calculations
1868060	1871580	start doing this these what I'm calling sensitivity analysis but probably is a better word
1872460	1877340	salim I'm going to put you to work on this adjacency matrix to to to do the the bootstrap
1879180	1885500	and I'm sorry if I'm sounding bossy or whatnot I'm just I'm just trying to just just okay okay
1885500	1889180	okay and regarding the method you are
1889180	1890300	but
1919180	1922220	and we it might take some time maybe
1926540	1930220	good thank you see I'm I'm confident you're very capable and I know this from
1931180	1937820	from years of working with you so um that's great sorry my legs fell asleep um there was one new
1938620	1945340	thing that uh came up in one of Caroline's emails that I wanted to not not that I want to give us
1945900	1949020	work to do or me more work to do or us more work to do but um
1950780	1957260	sorry my fit fall asleep um Caroline you mentioned something about like okay so we mentioned earlier
1957260	1961980	that there's these we have these different questions that are uh could be used to identify
1961980	1968940	people in age and then I think Caroline from among you had suggested could be sort of create an index
1968940	1976300	or an aggregate variable that indicated what I was hearing and I don't know if you said this
1977020	1982620	something about risk um and I really like that I don't I'm just raising it to see if this is
1982620	1988780	something we want to explore or put in the paper the the reason okay so look so we have these
1988780	1994780	different indicators that we could definitely use to indicate if someone is in the hidden population
1994780	1999180	that's great we can try out different ones and we can put a table and show the comparison and
1999180	2004220	that that's very cool in and of itself because to my knowledge not a lot of studies do that so
2004220	2010620	that's another advantage of the of your survey uh Caroline but I think and correct me if I'm wrong
2010620	2018300	that you had suggested like um could we combine them or sort of some sort of like a likeert scale
2018300	2021900	is kind of what I had in mind I really I I just want to raise it to see if that's something we
2021900	2026460	want to explore but the reason I think it's needed is because it's as far as I can tell me again you
2026460	2033500	all are the experts but when I read about modern slavery there's always this not always but there's
2033500	2042060	almost always this modern slavery and risk of of uh of experiencing modern slavery and and
2042940	2046300	what I'm getting at it seems like a lot of the literature that I read again you all are the
2046300	2053500	experts on this there is this dichotomous component of experiencing modern slavery yes or no but then
2053500	2060220	there's it seems on from like the policy pages white papers or whatnot that there's this risk
2060220	2066060	aspect what's the risk of someone being exposed or experiencing modern slavery and and my ears
2066060	2071500	sort of perked up when I read your email Caroline about combining various questions to get this index
2071500	2075420	or ranking or I don't I don't remember the language that you used um so I just wanted to raise that
2075420	2100860	to see if that's something we want to explore uh question mark I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
2105740	2114940	say one to seven or one to five against a particular attribute and those attributes are
2114940	2121820	you saying could be the various questions that we have um designed into the survey
2122860	2130140	exactly yes yes yes and maybe you're right maybe the liquid scale is too is too strong maybe we
2130220	2135980	we need something like a factor analysis or something so the way I and it's been since
2135980	2140540	graduate school since I studied this so I could be wrong but the way I remember liquid scales is that
2140540	2148620	there's it's a hierarchy right so if if you answered yes to question two then for sure you
2148620	2153260	answered yes to question one so basically they're these like levels of experiences and from what I
2153260	2158860	remember the questions kind of some of the questions seem to have that kind of flavor and correct me
2158940	2163500	if I'm wrong I could be I could be wrong there but but I mean if it's liquid or if it's if it's not
2163500	2168940	the the the liquid would be great but it's very very strong because it has this hierarchy this
2168940	2175420	nesting feature attribute but if not then you know some other way of aggregating individual
2175420	2181180	questions into a the idea is to get away from the dichotomous are you and are you speaking
2181180	2188700	about slavery yes or no into some sort of gradient where we and then could we sell that the index
2188700	2194780	or the ranking variable the thing that we make as something akin to risk of experiencing modern
2194780	2206380	slavery
2211100	2214380	yes yes 100% take take question
2214380	2220540	if you answered yes to question one and yes to question two that would put you at a higher
2220540	2226060	risk of modern slavery and sort of add on to end whatever exactly exactly right exactly right
2226060	2231580	exactly right sorry you said it way better than I did and much more succinctly as well I'm so sorry
2231580	2236700	oh boy waking up earlier next time drinking lots more coffee but but and like I said I don't know
2236700	2241820	if this this is something we want to do I mean it's just again it's where it's it's icing on the
2241820	2247340	cake it's not we definitely don't need to it's just the idea of risk popped into my head after
2247340	2256620	reading one of your emails caroline and it rang this bell of a yeah the risk is really interesting
2256620	2263900	and I think it comes from this criminalization of modern slavery so if you if you're saying that you
2263900	2271260	are in modern slavery it implies that you've met the legal standard for your whatever conditions
2271260	2279340	you're experiencing being proven and somebody being prosecuted so that's obviously quite a high bar
2280140	2285500	and there's obviously a spectrum of labor what might be called labor exploitation rather than
2285500	2293020	modern slavery which are undesirable conditions but they may not be modern they may not qualify you
2293020	2302060	as being somebody with positive grounds for a modern slavery case right but the more of these
2302060	2309180	poor um indicators of conditions that exist the more likely it is that your case would be considered
2309820	2315340	that of modern slavery so that seems to tie in with what you're suggesting Scott
2315820	2321260	perfect that's again I couldn't literally I couldn't say say it better myself Caroline yet
2321260	2326380	that's exactly right and also just to double kill on that we don't we have that from what I remember
2326380	2330700	reading through the code book we definitely have that there's these you know half a dozen a dozen
2330700	2334460	different questions that sort of get at these different I don't know angles aspects would have
2334460	2345020	you so like I mean I think that's yes Caroline yes 100% uh one thank you that's you've said it
2345020	2349340	better than I did two I'm pretty sure I don't know if we're in a unique position but we definitely
2350140	2354140	thanks to your survey I believe we have data to do just that and then three
2355100	2361820	can't count is that something we want to do in this paper yeah we can it would it would seem a neat
2361820	2370300	way of addressing these multiple instances of exploitation to to say that the more of these
2370300	2376620	questions that you're demonstrating apply to your situation the more likely it is that you are at risk
2376620	2383740	and the case we have to say at risk yes modern slavery yes because it's we haven't got legally
2383740	2389420	improving cases but I think we can legitimately say that excellent okay so now there's more
2390060	2397420	that's very very cool thank you uh now I just realized do I know how to do that I don't know
2398060	2404700	I mean the neat thing there is like this might be oh boy I need a lot more coffee so now that I've
2404700	2413420	just pitched this thing about risk and not a continuous rather than a dichotomous variable now
2413420	2418620	I'm just now thinking hang on how do you do scale up with
2421740	2425660	yeah what's it was a continuous dv I have I have no idea um
2428220	2431740	yeah we should think about I mean it's a neat it's a neat question I like I like these patches
2431740	2436220	okay all right well thank you for that and again sorry for just meandering all over the place but
2436220	2438940	Caroline you've you've you've you've you've saved my
2441260	2451500	nonsensical rhetoric um so um yeah so we've got Selene for September uh I'm gonna have to spend
2451500	2454300	I don't know how much time we're gonna have for this I'm very very interested and I understand
2454300	2458940	times of the essence and if I'm being honest I think you're both right that like or I don't
2458940	2464300	know if you're saying this but the sort of September is my best it's going to be September
2464300	2469180	or December because when teaching starts for me at least it just just the teaching starts it just
2469180	2479580	it's it's really really heavy um so what should we do next so I guess we press ahead with um if
2479580	2486380	you are happy to direct Selene for these last two weeks and see how far we can get um and then
2486380	2494380	we take stop and I can start drafting an article for modern slavery based on what we've got and then
2494380	2500540	if we need to we come back to it in December I guess sorry we don't get it no I mean that's the
2500540	2506940	the um reality of research and teaching I understand so for me I'm not teaching this semester I'm
2506940	2516140	teaching spring semester so I will have time to do some drafting um so I suppose the question is
2516140	2523740	how far can we get by then that's the concept of it isn't it okay for Dr. Moser I will send you that
2523740	2530540	excellent spreadsheet that I shared earlier and what else is needed for that data clinic or anything
2530540	2536060	else you should tell us to leave in the email if you want yeah well so one thing and this is going
2536060	2541180	to be a judgment so I'll leave it to to the two of you is is picking the questions I think you're
2541260	2546940	100% right Carolina I was making it too let's just pick five six questions that we think are
2546940	2554060	indicators of uh you had the right you had a better phrase but what questions we want to add
2554060	2560140	together to come up with this index or rank rank variable there's several that we could we'll need
2560140	2565820	to make a decision so I'll leave that to you we've got you know there's for my memory it's and again
2565820	2571980	kudos to you for the survey design it's it's everything from before I remember there's even
2571980	2576460	like an explicit question like are you being exploited maybe it's not literally that exploited
2576460	2581420	that explicit but then there's all these other you know have you been detained does your employer
2581420	2585660	have your travel documents there's all these other questions so we'll need to pick some
2586300	2593020	collection of those to to add together to make this this this risk indicator I don't know which
2593020	2599020	questions those are I'll leave that to to to to you um Selim uh yes you and I will be in touch
2599020	2605500	regarding the data um are you comfortable Selim doing the calculation so Caroline had this really
2605500	2613340	good uh it was it was from several emails ago but uh uh sort of a step by step the protocol
2613340	2619260	yeah the protocol what to calculate um once you tell me the data cleaning is good to go
2619980	2625340	then I can stop doing it and I will face some challenge that's fine and I'll get back that's
2625340	2631740	fine good good so in the in the short run then um we need to pick questions that indicate that you're
2631740	2637820	in the hidden population questions plural and then we can try out these individual questions
2637820	2642620	then we can also add them all together to get this risk index which I think is very cool and also
2642620	2649900	very challenging um step two uh Selim you and I will have to work on this adjacency matrix
2649900	2655980	that's only important for the bootstrapping which comes later so in the in the in the short run we
2655980	2663100	can you Selim can start doing these calculations based on on Caroline's protocol uh and Selim
2663100	2669820	you and I can can email on that and yeah let's push hard in September uh and uh
2672060	2677580	and see see what we we can do I I believe for sure we can do the calculations we can do the
2677580	2683500	calculations today I think um well once we have the questions sorted out uh the bootstrapping will
2683500	2688220	take a little bit of work but it's relatively straightforward the risk and scale up is really
2688220	2696060	interesting and in my mind sort of the step three down down the road I don't I don't really
2696060	2701020	know I don't have a clear picture on how to how to do that just yet um but I I think I have a
2702620	2709820	more focused uh idea of what's of what's happening I wish we had more time I'm really sorry everybody
2709820	2718060	that uh yeah sorry no that's great we appreciate everybody's juggling various things and we got
2718060	2724540	started the semester coming up there's a lot to think about so let me read this back to you
2724540	2731980	so that I can check I've got this right so from I need to pick the five or six question combinations
2732940	2737900	to produce a rank variable that would indicate somebody was at risk of being in the hidden
2737900	2747900	population um Selim will start calculating uh the GSM formula that were identified in the protocol
2749180	2755260	from our existing data set and you and Selim will you will help Selim
2756460	2760860	send the data in preparation for bootstrapping and then I think you had another point which
2761420	2769500	uh the the risk uh uh sort of that's on me or all of us to think about how to do scale up when
2770700	2777340	the dependent variable isn't dichotomous so scale up is meant to estimate the size of a population but
2778460	2785420	if we want to estimate the amount of risk in a population I don't it's not I don't I don't know
2785420	2790780	how to do that um but but I we we can think about it and we can figure out a way to do it does that
2790780	2795420	make sense I don't know if that makes sense yeah I think you just say yeah we don't know how to do
2795420	2802380	this yet but we think it could be interesting yeah that's right so um yeah yeah I think for me that
2802380	2809900	would be going back to the and then Selgin again trying to work out what their equations say about
2809900	2817420	yeah they use yeah whether you're in this situation of labor exploitation exploitation or not
2818060	2826220	versus yeah okay rather uh more of a spectrum exactly exactly you nailed it I mean the the
2832620	2837260	there's sort of cheap ways to do it like so there's all these model based so if you guys
2837900	2842380	the Laga paper I don't I can't remember who I've talked to about which papers
2843900	2853580	anyway so the the the Feehan and Solnik again amazing but they sort of have these two approaches
2853580	2859740	design based and model based and they seem to my my reading is they kind of favor the design
2859740	2864060	based which is fine so that's like designing the sample and whatnot there's this whole other way of
2864060	2869020	doing this kind of estimation that's model based where you just write down formulas and then you get
2869020	2876540	a fast computer to do MCMC bays posteriors blah blah blah and so it's sort of the cheap way to
2876540	2882220	do this is you just in the model based world you just replace a binomial distribution with a
2882220	2888380	Poisson distribution and and you're off and running um this is all regards to this this risk
2888380	2894540	business um uh forget I said any of that let me let me think on it I don't know I don't know how to
2894540	2898940	do it I'm sure there's some way to do it but let me forget I said anything let me let me let me
2898940	2903340	think on it and come back to you if you find it if you find any papers that will be useful for us to
2903340	2910620	read as background Scott then do just log them across and I'll um if you if you find a come across
2910620	2919420	anything and I'll also do this yes please I think the answer we'll see if we can find the answer
2919420	2925980	perhaps in the literature or the gap in the literature but I suspect that's for me going
2925980	2932140	beyond my methodological capability is certainly a present this is why collaborating is great this
2932140	2936540	we all have we all have comparative advantages and I horrible at writing I don't know this
2936620	2942220	the substance of this whatsoever so it's great to yeah this is this is why collaborating is great
2942220	2949180	um okay so hopefully we've got a complementary set of skills and I mean if we find I know at the
2949180	2953020	beginning you said you're not statistician but you obviously have a great deal more statistical
2953020	2959900	knowledge than I do but if you do feel that we need somebody else then I mean let me know and
2960700	2965100	we can try and recruit somebody because there was another guy who made contact with me
2965820	2971340	I said he was interested in this I think it's um David Murphy do you know David
2972780	2977660	no so I just said it was something we were working on at the moment but I can have a look
2977660	2984860	to see if we need to expand the team then we can do that too I think okay let's let's let's like you
2984860	2992140	said present yeah I think I mean you've just been your advice has been invaluable so I think we
2992220	2998860	we press on I agreed I agreed let's see I think you're on the same page let's let's let's do a
2998860	3006460	hard push in September and see how far we get and um Selene you and I will be emailing a lot
3006460	3014780	in the next two weeks um right that's perfect okay I think go ahead I've maybe making some
3014780	3019260	notes just to capture what we've said um I'll tidy those up and then I'll email them around
3019260	3023660	everybody say that we've got another marker in the sand about just just trying to capture the
3023660	3029260	discussions really sounds great yeah thanks so much and uh it's very it's very cool I'm
3030060	3033100	especially this next stage I'm actually very very excited about because this is like
3033980	3037580	this is where we start learning stuff this is where we like actually get anyway I'm I'm very
3037580	3045500	excited so let's let's uh thank you again thank you again right that's cool right fantastic thank
3045500	3051740	thank you all uh we'll be in touch thanks very much take care bye
3075500	3081740	okay
3165500	3172500	Thank you very much.
