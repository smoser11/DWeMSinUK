1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
there you go there you go sorry for being late thanks for tech problems you

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,080
know how it is but I got all of your documents I've read them in skimmed is

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,840
probably a more accurate word but I've got my coffee I've got my pen I'm

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,200
eager to get into it so thank you you're absolutely right with those things

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,160
that is what we need to work out sorry I'm not arriving with a map saying this

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,200
is how we we have to proceed I think it's something that we will find our way

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:49,160
through the jungle between us I hope so I mean already you're pointing us in the

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,160
direction of bootstrapping has been invaluable so yeah we really just sort of

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,400
feeling a way through the next steps to understand who's actually say what to do

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:08,720
and who's doing what right yeah that's all

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,120
I mean it might be an ongoing conversation it might be something we can't bottom now but it probably is a good idea also to discuss sort of time

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,880
frames that or at least share what we have in our own minds about time frame

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,200
so that we can see whether whether everything matches together or whether

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:35,800
there are going to be problems yeah so yeah so in terms of what's next you

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,480
talked about the objective and the division of labour well the objective

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,440
remains really to generate this estimate of the hidden population among

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,160
domestic workers as far as we are able to and you you can generalize network

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,440
scale-up methods to do that I mean that's the the overriding objective and

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,280
then how we do that I mean I think that's a matter of debate we I think as I

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,160
mentioned in my email have you seen it we've got Selim with us definitely full

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
time until the end of the month so again this comes into the time frame

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,880
conversation can we make maximum use of Selim's time now and then there's the

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,020
possibility I mean Selim come in here now if you want to but I believe

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:33,180
Selim's keen to continue looking at this yeah so you don't need to share my screen

25
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,460
yeah what you don't want to be able to share this so Dr. Moseley you sent this

26
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:45,420
article about the yoke yoke at all pay but who's on 22 for the neighborhood so

27
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,220
I've tried to understand it and and also work on it and what I understand is that

28
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:59,300
we need certain points or aspects to perform that bootstrap for our data set

29
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,540
and that is like the notes this is the list of our IDs basically and then we

30
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,500
have the edges and then we have the trades and degree so all that stuff I

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,980
have tried to put this down to the Excel spreadsheet I'm going to share it now so

32
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:27,180
you can tell me to what extent it looks cleaned up can you see it yes I can see

33
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,840
it thank you very much okay yeah so you're 100% right Selim so the I was

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,420
thinking about this this morning the the so I did have a quick look at the

35
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:45,180
okay let me take half a step back so by the way Caroline not that you need to

36
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,740
hear it for me but kudos your your lit review the document that you sent was

37
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:56,100
really really really spot-on but the so taking a whole step back the the

38
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,780
neighborhood boot is it's building on this thing called a tree okay so what's

39
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,620
the issue the issue is we want to bootstrapping but we definitely don't

40
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,620
have independence here Caroline's you rightly mentioned you know at best we

41
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,620
have a convenience sample in our DS so the issue is how do you bootstrapping in

42
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,660
these in this setting where you don't have independence whatsoever and so these

43
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,980
clever people have different ideas and there's this very very sophisticated and

44
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,660
I confess I didn't fully comprehend it but there's this tree method which is

45
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,540
meant to anyway doesn't matter then these other people as you both rightly said

46
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,300
come along and say actually there's an easier and better way to do this called

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,100
this neighborhood boot and and you're 100% right Selim that what's crucial here

48
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,420
is we need we need we need IDs we need to be able to uniquely identify each

49
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,660
respondent and then we need to know who referred who and so usually that that

50
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,740
takes the form of what's called an adjacency matrix this is just a graph so

51
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,100
you've got the nodes are the are the IDs and so if I'm person 60 and you're a

52
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,740
person 41 and I refer you then there's an edge from person 60 to person 41 you

53
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,900
get the idea and so on and so forth so that's the sort of the structure of the

54
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:16,700
data well that's one of the that's one component of the data that will need to

55
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,780
do this this neighborhood bootstrap that the idea behind the input was really

56
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,460
kind of surprising to me that it works so well but it does and we can sit sit

57
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,940
site and that's great but the idea is you just take everybody who refers

58
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,980
anybody and you just you just sample with replacement them and turns out that

59
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,980
works really well it's it's sort of surprisingly simple and and but at least

60
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,540
according to the papers it seems to work really really well so so so that's the

61
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,060
structure that we need so right so now I'm rambling coffee's just now kicking

62
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,620
in sorry so so Selim we need unique IDs for every single every single person and

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,700
then we need to know who referred who so thank you for sharing your screen so

64
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:07,660
like on line three it's a recruiter so you got node one recruiter and then node

65
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,820
two respondent recruit I don't understand can you flush that out for me I can I

66
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,700
can walk you through thank you so what we see here are the IDs of the people so

67
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,500
for some two is the ID person three four five these are the ID of the people and

68
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,780
when when there's written note one that's the recruiter that is 60 so when

69
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,460
we scroll down to 60 here we are seeing that is Anna here that would be Anna so

70
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:49,140
Anna has preferred on recruiting the second one so 60 ID 60 has recruited or

71
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,860
referred person ID to and when there's no number written this means they haven't

72
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:04,020
recruited they just complete the survey based on the promotion that our NGO

73
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,020
partners has forwarded to their to their own people so these are the seeds so this

74
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:17,220
right okay and then we can continue with that for some 41 has recruited 10 and

75
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:25,860
and six these are these other people good good yeah good good good so then that's

76
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,380
excellent thank you so then the next step would be to turn that into an adjacency

77
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:39,180
matrix I'm trying to think of the can you if you maybe already have sorry if you

78
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,780
have something but could you email me that excel file and I can have a think on

79
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:54,500
the easiest way to reshape this into an adjacency matrix yeah yeah I read and

80
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,820
I think there's something like zero and one yeah exactly so where where do we have

81
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:07,740
like where do these connections exist exactly yeah so I will send you the

82
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,860
excellent spreadsheet and you will tell me what to do next yeah after a lot more

83
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,660
coffee yeah so but just to be clear so this is this is only relevant for the

84
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,100
for the bootstrapping which I think we're all on board with is this is the

85
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:31,260
way to go with with these uncertainty estimates the I mean I guess you know we

86
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,380
could start with the calculations already right I mean Caroline you're you're I

87
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,860
know we call it memo or outline of sort of what how to proceed with the

88
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,700
calculations we could we could start with that given the data that we have I

89
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:54,140
think so that protocol that I sent through that had the different sum

90
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:00,140
quantities and actually the sort of the translation of the formula into our from

91
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:10,340
results into fiend and salgonics equations yes yes yes yes yes yes exactly

92
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:18,340
sorry sorry again fresh cup of coffee yeah I mean that would be our sample our

93
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,420
original sample data but without the bootstrapping exactly so we would be

94
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,100
doing a first pass through with our raw data I don't know I'm using the right

95
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,120
terminology as the first the first approach to actually plugging some

96
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,020
data in and getting some output yeah that's right so this would just be point

97
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,100
estimates without without any kind of uncertainty the end you're right the

98
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,340
bootstrapping would be a post hoc or ex post it would come later I think it's

99
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,860
gonna I think it's neat I think it's a nice contribution it's as slim as

100
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,620
intimated it's gonna take a bit more work to to structure the data in a way

101
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,420
that is amenable to doing this neighborhood bootstrap but we can we can

102
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,900
we can do that I mean I should have prepared more for this I'm sorry about

103
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:20,540
that I mean drink my coffee oh really it's it's definitely we're feeling our

104
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,020
way here so this is definitely a joint process the feelings mutual feelings

105
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,980
mutual and please stop you're gonna blush like a like a pink pig if you

106
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,300
anyway thank you very much with the feelings mutual I'm very much I guess

107
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,780
and again I'm so sorry for my completely scattered emails and behavior this

108
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,420
morning a few questions come to mind so I take your point Caroline thank you

109
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,140
very much for the the clarity on you know I think we all see what the

110
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,020
objective is and the tasks that are required we need to do these calculations

111
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,860
we need to get these uncertainty estimates a few questions that popped my

112
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,140
mind are things like audience or and I think Salimi mentioned a journal journal

113
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:15,180
so like so what what do we want this paper to look like is this a methods

114
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,060
paper is this a substance paper is it a little from column A a little from column

115
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:28,100
B is it you know what what um what what do we want the yeah who do we want the

116
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,220
paper to be for I guess is probably better yeah so I'm I'm wondering whether

117
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,980
it could go into a modern slavery journal if it isn't a methods paper which

118
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,140
I suspect it isn't I think we're not really going to make a contribution to

119
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,620
methods we're going to be using methods in an interesting way we hope to

120
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:58,780
produce an output but actually the the interest is in the the application of

121
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,940
this method to a particular social situation and which is looking at labor

122
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,180
exploitation among domestic workers in the UK and somewhere like the Journal of

123
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,900
Modern Slavery might be interested in the application of this method because

124
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:23,500
there have been recommendations from GFMS which is the Global Fund for Ending

125
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,380
Modern Slavery that these sorts of techniques ought to be used but as yet

126
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,980
there isn't any as far as I'm aware anyone who's tried to do it yeah so that

127
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,660
would probably protect us a little bit from the purists who would say well

128
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,900
you're really not using your method as appropriate as pristinely as perhaps you

129
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:51,300
could have done but it would perhaps meet the needs of a community for an

130
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,260
example of how this method was used but also providing some as you say a little

131
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,860
bit of common and a little bit but providing some substance that would be

132
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,540
of interest so potentially I mean I don't know whether you're interested in

133
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,940
publishing in that sort of journal it's not high-ranking but it is this is sort

134
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,900
of it's bread and butter how does that sound oh yeah yeah yeah I'm interested

135
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,420
in publishing anywhere I mean not literally anywhere but I mean I'm I'm

136
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,260
very very open to I'm not at all purists or snob or anything but yeah

137
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:33,780
that's absolutely fine for me so then I guess the what's next is sort of you

138
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,500
know tasks and I think I think you're you're right Caroline that we're yeah

139
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,540
we're not gonna make a methodological contribution I think the contribution is

140
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,180
applying these techniques to this and you're right I've been I've only seen G

141
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,980
and some used in very limited applications and I agree with you I've

142
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,580
never seen it for for modern slavery and certainly not modern slavery in the UK so

143
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,660
I think that's absolutely a contribution so I guess what's next is as you said

144
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,580
times of the essence so yeah who does who does what when

145
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:18,020
well I'm very happy to lead on the writing if that's oh yeah yeah I mean

146
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,020
that's what I'm trying to collect in terms of keeping memos of our meeting

147
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:31,180
so that I can generate a methodological section I know Salim and I are just

148
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,180
about to publish a report on the descriptive statistics related to this

149
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,300
work good so Salim's done quite a lot of work we had our survey checked through

150
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,540
by the director of labor market enforcement directors team and they

151
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,660
were particularly interested from a descriptive point of view in differences

152
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,860
between employment statuses in domestic workers so we have a report coming out

153
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,980
we're just talking about the date but we think it'll be the 9th of October that

154
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,060
focuses very much on different employment statuses which draws on

155
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,500
description descriptive statistics from that so that sort of side has been done

156
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,180
good but it I see this work as sort of feeding directly into a journal output

157
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,100
but when as I mentioned last time when I did do a blog about this for

158
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,100
international domestic workers day there is a lot of press interest so we're

159
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:36,500
talking to BBC's Midlands about the descriptive stats and we think they'll

160
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,900
plan to cover that in conjunction with the NGOs that we'd be working with

161
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,140
providing they get some case studies that's what's important for them but I

162
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,900
think there's ongoing interest in this and that once we've got something more

163
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:59,420
solid from a hidden population side I think they'll cover that too so I don't

164
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,460
the report is sort of a stage on the journey and I think the paper would be

165
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:12,500
another like a second stage another way marker and so that's how I'm seeing it

166
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,900
at present we've already submit our descriptive well one analysis from the

167
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,540
descriptive statistics to a director of labor market enforcement consultation

168
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,260
that closed a couple of weeks ago so that was sort of preempting some of the

169
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:36,580
figures that Salim's created from the report so we're hoping that this sort

170
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:43,540
of cumulative effect will sway policy because at the moment domestic workers

171
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,180
aren't identified as a sector of particular concern by the labor market

172
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,860
enforcement director and we're pressing to try and get them on the agenda so if

173
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,220
you like that's the impact case good excellent no thank you it's very very

174
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,700
helpful and I will leave all the impact and all the writing to you Caroline

175
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,180
because that is not my comparative advantage and clearly it is it is yours

176
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,540
but I think that's fantastic and I think you're right that the congratulations

177
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,780
by the way that just sounds really exciting to be honest with you that just

178
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,100
sounds really neat but if things is very helpful so if I'm

179
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:23,780
so I think I'm getting more focused now the the essentially you've cleaved off

180
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,060
the descriptive stuff which kudos like I think I mentioned in an email that the

181
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,740
survey that you have is really rich so there's tons of opportunity for

182
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,300
descriptive so by the way please send it over I'd love to just look at it and

183
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,540
just see what's going on if you don't mind right but the point is for this

184
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,860
paper we're taking a much more focus it's much more focus it's GN some it's

185
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,180
hidden population and and that's that and and and then the impact stuff can

186
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,780
can can can follow if I'm understanding you so that sounds great that's that's

187
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,820
that's very useful it's very helpful to sort of have that in in in mind so then

188
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,980
I mean I guess in terms of division of labor like we decided to get down to it

189
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:12,900
so the if I remember correctly so there's there's six different estimators in

190
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,380
the that paper is just the more I read it and reread it the sort of the second

191
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,380
onion it just keeps getting like it's just there's all these layers that I

192
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,020
didn't know and I thought I've read it really carefully by the way saline you

193
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,900
get all the credit for this because you you wouldn't we had a dissertation

194
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,540
meeting I'm rambling point is I love that paper it's weird the more I read it

195
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,900
the weirder it gets so there's these six different estimators I think Carolina

196
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,580
you focused on two of interest and I had suggested that maybe we could sort of

197
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,620
augment them 23 and 24 or something like that doesn't matter um they have these

198
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,620
bounds for these these three different adjustment factors and I think we

199
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,060
decided although I'm certainly open to revisiting this that we could ask that

200
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,140
we could calculate two of the adjustment factors and that the visibility

201
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,820
the true positive rate was going to be difficult but maybe with this last email

202
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,020
maybe we could just there might be some kind of hack if we could make this somewhat

203
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:30,820
Herculean assumption that people people in age that know people in they've gone

204
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,260
through the national referral mechanism those people know the person in age that

205
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:45,020
makes sense it doesn't make sense the issue for what I remember the issue with

206
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,620
the visibility is the the true positive rate is that you need to know and this is

207
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,100
my opinion one of the weaknesses of G and some is it's really cognitively demanding so you need

208
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:01,980
to sample from age and you'd ask people in the hidden population about what people in the sample

209
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:11,420
frame know about them exactly exactly exactly you're speaking better than than than I am um

210
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,340
there are these sort of hacks I mentioned that maybe we could I mean we should try it out and

211
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,540
then just you know report it honestly or not report it if there's nothing interesting to

212
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,180
report but but and Caroline you seem to be from what I remember in your email that you somewhat

213
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,900
positive about this assumption that people have gone through the national referral mechanism

214
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,900
know I don't know how to say this in English if if someone who's in the hidden population

215
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,100
reports knowing eight people they've gone through the the national referral mechanism

216
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:55,340
can we assume that all eight of those people know that the person responding the person in age

217
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,700
is in the hidden population and if we can make that assumption then we can I think we can calculate

218
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:21,900
this the third um the third um adjustment factor that's really interesting I mean I'm sorry sorry

219
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,420
yeah I'm sorry no it's it's very very strange because it's all these I don't have a clear

220
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,740
head for it okay so we can so we sample people and then some of them there were there's referrals

221
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,300
and oh by by the way just really really quick and I'm sorry again to be so scattered the um

222
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,500
so how does the recruitment work you give them coupons is there a fixed number of coupons

223
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:53,020
or is it just as many people as they want to refer no it was um contact telephone contact numbers

224
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,260
and I think they had up to five is that correct can you remember on the survey okay but they

225
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:06,860
could refer up to five people okay um mobile phone number so that was effectively acting as a unique

226
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,300
coupon identifier right good good thank you thank you that's I just right back okay so so we have

227
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:20,700
the sample and and it's uh and it comes in waves thanks to referrals and that's all that's fine it's

228
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,140
absolutely no problem some of okay let me start differently we have a sample from the sampling

229
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,620
frame which is domestic workers in the UK so it's very well defined well they have a mobile number

230
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,300
fine perfectly well defined excellent fantastic so that's that's that's the sampling frame some of

231
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,220
those people happen to be in the hidden population that we just sort of lucked out to to to get and

232
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,540
we can identify them through a number of Caroline you have a much better grasp on this than I but

233
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,700
there's half a dozen different questions that we could use to to or combinations thereof to

234
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:03,100
identify um oh yeah that's another thing I should before I forget risk um uh that we can identify

235
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,940
okay fine so I'm I'm tabling that and leaving it to you all the experts um so we sort of we just

236
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:19,660
all happen to have some people in in age in our sample now the the the probalters are

237
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,300
what I originally thought there was only one but Caroline you've really pointed out that we

238
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,860
actually have more than that so one is domestic workers so how many domestic workers working in

239
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,020
the UK that have a mobile number do you know so that's fine we we we have officials I think

240
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,540
correct me if I'm wrong we have official statistics on that so we know the the the

241
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,620
that the known size subpopulation so that's fine we can use that for the scale up

242
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:56,380
yeah that's a big question oh sorry to dampen the fire on that one but among the the visa

243
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:02,460
situation is a little bit strange so a large number of domestic workers come over on the overseas

244
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,260
domestic worker visa so where we have people from the Philippines so sort of a subsets of our

245
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:17,580
sample we have a um a population estimate which we can base on the visa issuing numbers but then

246
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,860
there's this other part of the sample so particularly for example people from Latin America who may

247
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:34,780
come over on a BA visa where they have nationality Spanish or Portuguese nationality so therefore

248
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:41,820
they have the right to come into the UK to work now that bit is more difficult to estimate

249
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,940
so we could assume that we are only counting people with overseas domestic workers but we

250
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,820
know if we do that we will be artificially limiting the overall population size so our

251
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,740
estimation would be too large so I mean we can make that assumption but we'd have to state that

252
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:10,220
as a limitation of that approach what makes sense yes yes and thank you and that's again the onion

253
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:17,260
just keeps getting um could could be is it would it is it less egregious to

254
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,820
I thought this is getting weird

255
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,860
is it is it more palpable to assume that

256
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:41,260
that people entering on a particular visa no domestic workers they're also on that visa so

257
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,740
for example people from the Philippines yeah that would work that so that that might be one

258
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,580
possible I mean you're right like this is just a limitation we'll just have to say it but I'm

259
00:25:51,580 --> 00:26:06,780
just thinking aloud if we could yeah try to okay right and another way to justify this would be

260
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,940
your from what I understand and you guys know this way better than I do but the dealing with the NGOs

261
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,740
are are it's what I gathered and Craig from wrong they're sort of national or ethnicity specific

262
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,540
is what I gathered so that that might also help with the justification though okay so okay so so

263
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:31,740
data problem 41 aside um we just so happened to have people in in age and so what's this this

264
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,940
augmented relational data the game of contacts what what they would do is they would take the

265
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,900
people in age and they would ask them how many doctors do you know pro valter and then how many

266
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:53,500
doctors do you know that know that you're in the hidden population that's a hard question but that's

267
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,900
what's required that's what's required for this third adjustment factor um so we don't have that

268
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:05,180
that's fine so what I was suggesting is could we assume that so so we don't have doctors we don't

269
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:11,980
have people named John we have domestic workers in the UK and we have people have gone through the

270
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,060
national referral mechanism so by the just so I'm clear we do have numbers on that don't we

271
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,700
we do okay good so so what I'm suggesting and again it's this is a big assumption and I don't

272
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:29,020
know if it's justified but could we assume that so just for simplicity let's just say there's two

273
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,380
pro valter groups there's the UK domestic workers who have a mobile number and people that you know

274
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,660
they've gone through the national referral mechanism so if we we do we so happen to have

275
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,900
somebody in in age and we ask them how many people do you know they've gone through the

276
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,900
natural referral mechanism we have that answer we had that's I don't know what it is was question

277
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,660
something could we assume so say so say I'm in age and you just so happen to sample me and I say I

278
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,900
know eight people have gone through the natural referral mechanism could we assume that all eight

279
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,860
of those people that I know that have gone through the natural referral mechanism can we assume that

280
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:11,420
all eight of them know that I'm in the hidden population if so then I think we could we could

281
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,700
work out all three of these I think more copies needed that we could work out all three of these

282
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,540
adjustment factors now I'm sort of on the one hand that seems like a big assumption on the other hand

283
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,900
it seems plausible but again you guys are the substance experts on this because if I know people

284
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,660
that if I'm in if I'm being exploited I know people have gone through the natural referral

285
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:41,980
mechanism it doesn't seem too big a leap to think that those people that were sort of can

286
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,780
that we're we're we're into you know that I know them they know me

287
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,660
yeah if I think it's arguable that we could assume it I mean I think we can state our assumptions

288
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,580
yes of course yeah

289
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,900
and and then be challenged on it that's right that's right at least it's uh we can say that

290
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,460
that assumption may not hold true but that's the assumption that we've made for practical purposes

291
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,700
in this study and like I said this is this is this is kind of icing on the cake I mean we don't

292
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:16,860
you know we don't we don't it's not a deal breaker we don't have to do this I mean we can we've we've

293
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,780
we've got the data we've got and we can do the calculations and do the bootstrap and

294
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,740
and I was just thinking a lot if we could if we could well like I said you know we should

295
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,860
probably just do a bunch of stuff and see what we want to report and uh okay so sorry I'm so

296
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:41,260
scattered so um so um so what's next who who's going to do what and then I did have one additional

297
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,700
sort of okay so so so what's next so what I think is we just need to start doing calculations so we

298
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:53,900
need to uh do the insum do the adjustment factors uh personally I really like this idea of

299
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:03,980
the bounds in the subliminal appendix so basically so my idea is to is to um so say we can't estimate

300
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,700
all three of the adjustment factors we can use a kind of sensitivity analysis and say so we we

301
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,300
know that the true positive rate ranges between zero and one or zero infinity I don't remember

302
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,620
where it is but it's it's in the paper what happens to our estimates of the size of the

303
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:26,220
hidden population as we just sweep over all of the possible values for this this third adjustment

304
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:33,660
factor um I kind of like that because it it sort of tells you something about I mean it's that it's

305
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,660
heuristic but it tells you something about about well it tells you something about how important

306
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,940
these adjustment factors are in in estimating the size of the hidden population right if if

307
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,900
if you sweep over all the possible values and the size of the hidden population I mean it's

308
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,700
going to change some who doesn't change by an order of magnitude and that gives you well that tells

309
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,540
you something that that third adjustment factor the true positive rate isn't very important in

310
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,860
this particular instance which is which is something I mean that that's that's information

311
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,060
that's that's that's that's good you know okay so I think we need to just start doing calculations

312
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,580
start doing this these what I'm calling sensitivity analysis but probably is a better word

313
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,340
salim I'm going to put you to work on this adjacency matrix to to to do the the bootstrap

314
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:25,500
and I'm sorry if I'm sounding bossy or whatnot I'm just I'm just trying to just just okay okay

315
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,180
okay and regarding the method you are

316
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,300
but

317
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,220
and we it might take some time maybe

318
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,220
good thank you see I'm I'm confident you're very capable and I know this from

319
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,820
from years of working with you so um that's great sorry my legs fell asleep um there was one new

320
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:25,340
thing that uh came up in one of Caroline's emails that I wanted to not not that I want to give us

321
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,020
work to do or me more work to do or us more work to do but um

322
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,260
sorry my fit fall asleep um Caroline you mentioned something about like okay so we mentioned earlier

323
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,980
that there's these we have these different questions that are uh could be used to identify

324
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:48,940
people in age and then I think Caroline from among you had suggested could be sort of create an index

325
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:56,300
or an aggregate variable that indicated what I was hearing and I don't know if you said this

326
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,620
something about risk um and I really like that I don't I'm just raising it to see if this is

327
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:08,780
something we want to explore or put in the paper the the reason okay so look so we have these

328
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,780
different indicators that we could definitely use to indicate if someone is in the hidden population

329
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,180
that's great we can try out different ones and we can put a table and show the comparison and

330
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,220
that that's very cool in and of itself because to my knowledge not a lot of studies do that so

331
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,620
that's another advantage of the of your survey uh Caroline but I think and correct me if I'm wrong

332
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:38,300
that you had suggested like um could we combine them or sort of some sort of like a likeert scale

333
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,900
is kind of what I had in mind I really I I just want to raise it to see if that's something we

334
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,460
want to explore but the reason I think it's needed is because it's as far as I can tell me again you

335
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:53,500
all are the experts but when I read about modern slavery there's always this not always but there's

336
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:02,060
almost always this modern slavery and risk of of uh of experiencing modern slavery and and

337
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,300
what I'm getting at it seems like a lot of the literature that I read again you all are the

338
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:13,500
experts on this there is this dichotomous component of experiencing modern slavery yes or no but then

339
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:20,220
there's it seems on from like the policy pages white papers or whatnot that there's this risk

340
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:26,060
aspect what's the risk of someone being exposed or experiencing modern slavery and and my ears

341
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,500
sort of perked up when I read your email Caroline about combining various questions to get this index

342
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,420
or ranking or I don't I don't remember the language that you used um so I just wanted to raise that

343
00:34:35,420 --> 00:35:00,860
to see if that's something we want to explore uh question mark I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry

344
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:14,940
say one to seven or one to five against a particular attribute and those attributes are

345
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:21,820
you saying could be the various questions that we have um designed into the survey

346
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:30,140
exactly yes yes yes and maybe you're right maybe the liquid scale is too is too strong maybe we

347
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,980
we need something like a factor analysis or something so the way I and it's been since

348
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,540
graduate school since I studied this so I could be wrong but the way I remember liquid scales is that

349
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:48,620
there's it's a hierarchy right so if if you answered yes to question two then for sure you

350
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,260
answered yes to question one so basically they're these like levels of experiences and from what I

351
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,860
remember the questions kind of some of the questions seem to have that kind of flavor and correct me

352
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,500
if I'm wrong I could be I could be wrong there but but I mean if it's liquid or if it's if it's not

353
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,940
the the the liquid would be great but it's very very strong because it has this hierarchy this

354
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:15,420
nesting feature attribute but if not then you know some other way of aggregating individual

355
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:21,180
questions into a the idea is to get away from the dichotomous are you and are you speaking

356
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:28,700
about slavery yes or no into some sort of gradient where we and then could we sell that the index

357
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:34,780
or the ranking variable the thing that we make as something akin to risk of experiencing modern

358
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:46,380
slavery

359
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,380
yes yes 100% take take question

360
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:00,540
if you answered yes to question one and yes to question two that would put you at a higher

361
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,060
risk of modern slavery and sort of add on to end whatever exactly exactly right exactly right

362
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,580
exactly right sorry you said it way better than I did and much more succinctly as well I'm so sorry

363
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,700
oh boy waking up earlier next time drinking lots more coffee but but and like I said I don't know

364
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,820
if this this is something we want to do I mean it's just again it's where it's it's icing on the

365
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:27,340
cake it's not we definitely don't need to it's just the idea of risk popped into my head after

366
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:36,620
reading one of your emails caroline and it rang this bell of a yeah the risk is really interesting

367
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:43,900
and I think it comes from this criminalization of modern slavery so if you if you're saying that you

368
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:51,260
are in modern slavery it implies that you've met the legal standard for your whatever conditions

369
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:59,340
you're experiencing being proven and somebody being prosecuted so that's obviously quite a high bar

370
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,500
and there's obviously a spectrum of labor what might be called labor exploitation rather than

371
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:13,020
modern slavery which are undesirable conditions but they may not be modern they may not qualify you

372
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:22,060
as being somebody with positive grounds for a modern slavery case right but the more of these

373
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:29,180
poor um indicators of conditions that exist the more likely it is that your case would be considered

374
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,340
that of modern slavery so that seems to tie in with what you're suggesting Scott

375
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,260
perfect that's again I couldn't literally I couldn't say say it better myself Caroline yet

376
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,380
that's exactly right and also just to double kill on that we don't we have that from what I remember

377
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,700
reading through the code book we definitely have that there's these you know half a dozen a dozen

378
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,460
different questions that sort of get at these different I don't know angles aspects would have

379
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:05,020
you so like I mean I think that's yes Caroline yes 100% uh one thank you that's you've said it

380
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,340
better than I did two I'm pretty sure I don't know if we're in a unique position but we definitely

381
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,140
thanks to your survey I believe we have data to do just that and then three

382
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,820
can't count is that something we want to do in this paper yeah we can it would it would seem a neat

383
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:30,300
way of addressing these multiple instances of exploitation to to say that the more of these

384
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,620
questions that you're demonstrating apply to your situation the more likely it is that you are at risk

385
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:43,740
and the case we have to say at risk yes modern slavery yes because it's we haven't got legally

386
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:49,420
improving cases but I think we can legitimately say that excellent okay so now there's more

387
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:57,420
that's very very cool thank you uh now I just realized do I know how to do that I don't know

388
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,700
I mean the neat thing there is like this might be oh boy I need a lot more coffee so now that I've

389
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:13,420
just pitched this thing about risk and not a continuous rather than a dichotomous variable now

390
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,620
I'm just now thinking hang on how do you do scale up with

391
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,660
yeah what's it was a continuous dv I have I have no idea um

392
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,740
yeah we should think about I mean it's a neat it's a neat question I like I like these patches

393
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,220
okay all right well thank you for that and again sorry for just meandering all over the place but

394
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,940
Caroline you've you've you've you've you've saved my

395
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:51,500
nonsensical rhetoric um so um yeah so we've got Selene for September uh I'm gonna have to spend

396
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,300
I don't know how much time we're gonna have for this I'm very very interested and I understand

397
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,940
times of the essence and if I'm being honest I think you're both right that like or I don't

398
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,300
know if you're saying this but the sort of September is my best it's going to be September

399
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,180
or December because when teaching starts for me at least it just just the teaching starts it just

400
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:19,580
it's it's really really heavy um so what should we do next so I guess we press ahead with um if

401
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:26,380
you are happy to direct Selene for these last two weeks and see how far we can get um and then

402
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:34,380
we take stop and I can start drafting an article for modern slavery based on what we've got and then

403
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,540
if we need to we come back to it in December I guess sorry we don't get it no I mean that's the

404
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:46,940
the um reality of research and teaching I understand so for me I'm not teaching this semester I'm

405
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:56,140
teaching spring semester so I will have time to do some drafting um so I suppose the question is

406
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:03,740
how far can we get by then that's the concept of it isn't it okay for Dr. Moser I will send you that

407
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:10,540
excellent spreadsheet that I shared earlier and what else is needed for that data clinic or anything

408
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:16,060
else you should tell us to leave in the email if you want yeah well so one thing and this is going

409
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,180
to be a judgment so I'll leave it to to the two of you is is picking the questions I think you're

410
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,940
100% right Carolina I was making it too let's just pick five six questions that we think are

411
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:34,060
indicators of uh you had the right you had a better phrase but what questions we want to add

412
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:40,140
together to come up with this index or rank rank variable there's several that we could we'll need

413
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,820
to make a decision so I'll leave that to you we've got you know there's for my memory it's and again

414
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,980
kudos to you for the survey design it's it's everything from before I remember there's even

415
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,460
like an explicit question like are you being exploited maybe it's not literally that exploited

416
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,420
that explicit but then there's all these other you know have you been detained does your employer

417
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,660
have your travel documents there's all these other questions so we'll need to pick some

418
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:13,020
collection of those to to add together to make this this this risk indicator I don't know which

419
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,020
questions those are I'll leave that to to to to you um Selim uh yes you and I will be in touch

420
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:25,500
regarding the data um are you comfortable Selim doing the calculation so Caroline had this really

421
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:33,340
good uh it was it was from several emails ago but uh uh sort of a step by step the protocol

422
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,260
yeah the protocol what to calculate um once you tell me the data cleaning is good to go

423
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,340
then I can stop doing it and I will face some challenge that's fine and I'll get back that's

424
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:51,740
fine good good so in the in the short run then um we need to pick questions that indicate that you're

425
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,820
in the hidden population questions plural and then we can try out these individual questions

426
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,620
then we can also add them all together to get this risk index which I think is very cool and also

427
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:09,900
very challenging um step two uh Selim you and I will have to work on this adjacency matrix

428
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,980
that's only important for the bootstrapping which comes later so in the in the in the short run we

429
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:23,100
can you Selim can start doing these calculations based on on Caroline's protocol uh and Selim

430
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:29,820
you and I can can email on that and yeah let's push hard in September uh and uh

431
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:37,580
and see see what we we can do I I believe for sure we can do the calculations we can do the

432
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:43,500
calculations today I think um well once we have the questions sorted out uh the bootstrapping will

433
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,220
take a little bit of work but it's relatively straightforward the risk and scale up is really

434
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:56,060
interesting and in my mind sort of the step three down down the road I don't I don't really

435
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,020
know I don't have a clear picture on how to how to do that just yet um but I I think I have a

436
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:09,820
more focused uh idea of what's of what's happening I wish we had more time I'm really sorry everybody

437
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:18,060
that uh yeah sorry no that's great we appreciate everybody's juggling various things and we got

438
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,540
started the semester coming up there's a lot to think about so let me read this back to you

439
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:31,980
so that I can check I've got this right so from I need to pick the five or six question combinations

440
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,900
to produce a rank variable that would indicate somebody was at risk of being in the hidden

441
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:47,900
population um Selim will start calculating uh the GSM formula that were identified in the protocol

442
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:55,260
from our existing data set and you and Selim will you will help Selim

443
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,860
send the data in preparation for bootstrapping and then I think you had another point which

444
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:09,500
uh the the risk uh uh sort of that's on me or all of us to think about how to do scale up when

445
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:17,340
the dependent variable isn't dichotomous so scale up is meant to estimate the size of a population but

446
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,420
if we want to estimate the amount of risk in a population I don't it's not I don't I don't know

447
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,780
how to do that um but but I we we can think about it and we can figure out a way to do it does that

448
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,420
make sense I don't know if that makes sense yeah I think you just say yeah we don't know how to do

449
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:42,380
this yet but we think it could be interesting yeah that's right so um yeah yeah I think for me that

450
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,900
would be going back to the and then Selgin again trying to work out what their equations say about

451
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:57,420
yeah they use yeah whether you're in this situation of labor exploitation exploitation or not

452
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:06,220
versus yeah okay rather uh more of a spectrum exactly exactly you nailed it I mean the the

453
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,260
there's sort of cheap ways to do it like so there's all these model based so if you guys

454
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,380
the Laga paper I don't I can't remember who I've talked to about which papers

455
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:33,580
anyway so the the the Feehan and Solnik again amazing but they sort of have these two approaches

456
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:39,740
design based and model based and they seem to my my reading is they kind of favor the design

457
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,060
based which is fine so that's like designing the sample and whatnot there's this whole other way of

458
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,020
doing this kind of estimation that's model based where you just write down formulas and then you get

459
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:56,540
a fast computer to do MCMC bays posteriors blah blah blah and so it's sort of the cheap way to

460
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,220
do this is you just in the model based world you just replace a binomial distribution with a

461
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:08,380
Poisson distribution and and you're off and running um this is all regards to this this risk

462
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:14,540
business um uh forget I said any of that let me let me think on it I don't know I don't know how to

463
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,940
do it I'm sure there's some way to do it but let me forget I said anything let me let me let me

464
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,340
think on it and come back to you if you find it if you find any papers that will be useful for us to

465
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:30,620
read as background Scott then do just log them across and I'll um if you if you find a come across

466
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:39,420
anything and I'll also do this yes please I think the answer we'll see if we can find the answer

467
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:45,980
perhaps in the literature or the gap in the literature but I suspect that's for me going

468
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:52,140
beyond my methodological capability is certainly a present this is why collaborating is great this

469
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,540
we all have we all have comparative advantages and I horrible at writing I don't know this

470
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:02,220
the substance of this whatsoever so it's great to yeah this is this is why collaborating is great

471
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:09,180
um okay so hopefully we've got a complementary set of skills and I mean if we find I know at the

472
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,020
beginning you said you're not statistician but you obviously have a great deal more statistical

473
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:19,900
knowledge than I do but if you do feel that we need somebody else then I mean let me know and

474
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:25,100
we can try and recruit somebody because there was another guy who made contact with me

475
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:31,340
I said he was interested in this I think it's um David Murphy do you know David

476
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,660
no so I just said it was something we were working on at the moment but I can have a look

477
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:44,860
to see if we need to expand the team then we can do that too I think okay let's let's let's like you

478
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:52,140
said present yeah I think I mean you've just been your advice has been invaluable so I think we

479
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:58,860
we press on I agreed I agreed let's see I think you're on the same page let's let's let's do a

480
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:06,460
hard push in September and see how far we get and um Selene you and I will be emailing a lot

481
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:14,780
in the next two weeks um right that's perfect okay I think go ahead I've maybe making some

482
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,260
notes just to capture what we've said um I'll tidy those up and then I'll email them around

483
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,660
everybody say that we've got another marker in the sand about just just trying to capture the

484
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:29,260
discussions really sounds great yeah thanks so much and uh it's very it's very cool I'm

485
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,100
especially this next stage I'm actually very very excited about because this is like

486
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,580
this is where we start learning stuff this is where we like actually get anyway I'm I'm very

487
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:45,500
excited so let's let's uh thank you again thank you again right that's cool right fantastic thank

488
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:51,740
thank you all uh we'll be in touch thanks very much take care bye

489
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,740
okay

490
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Thank you very much.
